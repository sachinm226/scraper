  Injury doubts over Ross Taylor and James Franklin have led to the elevation of the uncapped <a href="/newzealand/content/player/38418.html">Shanan Stewart</a> to New Zealand's squad ahead of the third ODI in Hamilton on Tuesday. Stewart, the Canterbury batsman, is in the middle of an excellent season and has won some recognition following the hamstring problems of Taylor and Franklin.

  The pair is in doubt for the remainder of the five-match ODI series, with Taylor pulling out before the loss <a href="/nzvaus2010/engine/match/423792.html">in Auckland</a> and Franklin hobbling off during the game. Mark Greatbatch, New Zealand's coach, said they were unlikely to play on Tuesday but Taylor was the greater chance to return for the final fixtures.

  Stewart, 27, is in outstanding form after making 227 against Central Districts on Sunday and has been redirected to Hamilton. "Shanan has been in our thinking for the Twenty20 World Cup, he's in great nick, he's got a couple of hundreds and a 200 today," Greatbatch told <i>NZPA</i>.

  "He's an experienced middle-order player, a very dynamic one-day player and we feel he plays the aggressive game we're looking to play against the Australians." Stewart was chosen last week in New Zealand's 30-man <a href="/wt202010/content/story/450874.html">World Twenty20</a> squad and will be keen to impress if given an opportunity.
