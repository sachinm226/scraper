  <a href="/australia/content/player/7133.html">Ricky Ponting</a> called Australia's performance in the heavy loss to South Africa the worst in a long time, but has vowed to improve for the third game in Cape Town on Thursday. The tourists were dismissed for <a href="/rsavaus2009/engine/match/350478.html">131 in 40.2 overs</a> after starting the match by dropping to 5 for 19.

  South Africa passed the target for the loss of three wickets and levelled the five-fixture contest that will determine the game's No. 1 side. "That was as bad as we've played in a long time," Ponting told <i>AAP</i>.

  Ponting blamed poor shots for the tiny total, which was inflated by Callum Ferguson's 50 off 83 deliveries, his second ODI half-century. "We knew that the ball would probably swing a little bit this morning," Ponting said.

  "It wasn't as if it was swinging around corners either. The wicket was very good. There were some poor shots today from the top-order players in particular and we exposed our middle order to the new ball."

  Despite the significant defeat, which followed their <a href="/rsavaus2009/engine/match/350477.html">141-run win</a> on Friday, Ponting said it was time to move on. "We've had one poor performance," he said. "We've got a few days to try to turn things around. I'm sure that you'll see a better team on Thursday."
