Hugh: "DOn't know why we are always complaining about Australian spinners. We were lucky to have someone like Warne for so long, but that sort of talent can not easily be replicated. Just like you cannot easily replicate the talent of Tendulker, or Botham, or Bradman. These talents come up once in a generation. Between times, you need to make do with the best you can, and most of the time means that you play with the guy who's in form - at the moment Doherty."
 Innings Start
That is it from us for this game. Read Brydon Coverdale's report. Abhishek Purohit signing off for the moment. Cheers, and don't let it go down to the wire.
Clarke is the choice for the Man of the Match. Well.
Clarke: "Our bowlers deserved a lot of credit. We were probably 25-30 runs short on that wicket. Starc will learn a lot from this. The wicket was a bit slow, no one went on to get a hundred today. I felt a little bogged down with the bat but tried to hang in there with the other guys. We need to play better than this if we have to beat the two World Cup finalists."
Mahela: "Great effort from Angelo, but we gave away too many wickets in the middle overs to lose our way. We did the hard work with the ball, we did not get a couple of big stands with the bat. They put a lot of pressure on our guys. Angelo is one who likes to finish games for us, he handles his situations much better, we sent in the left-hander ahead of him as a left-hander was bowling. It wasn't to be but. We made a few mistakes, couple of lost catches, we made too many mistakes, we didn't deserve to win it."
They were one hit away Sri Lanka. What a spunky last-wicket partnership, Angelo has been involved in a few now, what a cool bat he is. Prasad showed plenty of fight. The short ball was there to be hit but Angelo could not manage to clear long on. Australia have sneaked away with this one. Doherty's outstanding return of 2 for 24 in ten overs was not in vain
Randy: "McKay should bowl the last over, not Starc. Great inswinger to the righties but he bowls too much fruit. And a half-tracker when it's six to win??? Uhh... a yorker will do."
49.5;W;Starc to Angelo Mathews, OUT but he has holed out, oh dear, heartbreak for Angelo and Sri Lanka, Australia and Starc can breathe now, makes room for the short ball, winds up and has a crack at it, but can only spoon it in the air as far as long on, Australia get together, they will be a relieved lot;Angelo Mathews c Christian b Starc 64 (101m 76b 4x4 1x6) SR: 84.21;
