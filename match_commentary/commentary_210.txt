2.37 pm The Australians converge around Starc, clapping him on and patting him on the back, thankful for his presence for without him they would rarely have picked wickets in this series. Colombo, much like Galle, did not give anything to the fast bowlers but Starc just didn't care. His pace through the air kept him in play all through his 25.1 overs. Starc is the first fast bowler to take three five-fors in a Test series in Sri Lanka
But for all his efforts, Australia are staring at a massive deficit - 355. Their batsmen better have found a way to handle the hosts' three spinners. Not least because they are going one short having dropped Burns and Khawaja
141.1;W;Starc to Lakmal, OUT five for Starc, three of them back-to-back! Runs in from around the stumps, squares the batsman up, it's short of a length, pins him to the crease. Gets the outside edge and Marsh dives forward in the gully to take it;Suranga Lakmal c Marsh b Starc 5 (22m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 45.45;
140.6;4;Marsh to Sandakan, FOUR runs moves over the wicket for a fuller ball and Sandakan whips it to the midwicket boundary like he were batting on a hundred;
140.5;?;Marsh to Sandakan, no run shortish on off stump, Sandakan looks for a flat-batted punch and gets an inside edge;
140.4;?;Marsh to Sandakan, no run back of a length on middle and leg, he gets outside the line and nudges it to leg gully.;
140.3;?;Marsh to Sandakan, no run big grunt as he tests the middle of the deck again, wanders harmlessly down leg;
140.2;1;Marsh to Lakmal, 1 run another short one from around the stumps, Lakmal takes his eyes off it as he pulls and manages to find a safe spot at deep square leg;
140.1;2;Marsh to Lakmal, 2 runs banged in, the ball wanders wide outside off, Lakmal drags it with a pull to deep midwicket. Sri Lanka get their 350!;
139.6;?;Starc to Sandakan, no run full, wide, and pacy. Goes through Sandakan before he could reach it;
139.5;?;Starc to Sandakan, no run shortish in length, but the line is down leg, Sandakan looks for a flick and fails to connect;
139.4;?;Starc to Sandakan, no run another one dug in on middle and leg, Sandakan fends it away past short leg. Ungainly, but good enough;
139.3;?;Starc to Sandakan, no run that was expected, Sandakan flashes a big old grin after looking around for where the bouncer had gone after it had hit him. Right at the body, from over the stumps, too quick for him to take evasive action;
139.2;W;Starc to Chandimal, OUT got 'im! Reverse swing does Chandimal after a stellar innings. Props for Starc too, running in and bowling as quick and as full as he possibly could. It's outside off, tempting the drive. Chandimal flashes at it, the ball straightens down the line, takes the edge and settles in Nevill's gloves. Good, sharp catch moving to his right;Dinesh Chandimal c ?Nevill b Starc 132 (474m 356b 13x4 1x6) SR: 37.07;
139.1;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run looks for the base of off stump at 141 kph, Chandimal drives into the covers;
138.6;?;Hazlewood to Lakmal, no run back of a length on off stump, defended;
138.5;?;Hazlewood to Lakmal, no run banged in short, but a distance wide of off stump, Lakmal is happy to watch it go by;
138.4;?;Hazlewood to Lakmal, no run they've not been able to get any movement, now it appears to be too much. Oh the irony! A lbw appeal after Hazlewood traps Lakmal on the crease, his flick looking more awful the more you see it. But it would have gone down leg easily;
138.3;?;Hazlewood to Lakmal, no run tails in on off stump, Lakmal blocks;
138.2;1;Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run keeps leg side of a good length ball and slashes it through cover;
138.1;1;Hazlewood to Lakmal, 1 run they are trying to intimidate the tailender with short balls, but there is hardly any pace in the pitch. So much that Lakmal can stand tall and whip-pull the ball past leg gully;
137.6;?;Marsh to Chandimal, no run good length ball on middle, stays down a touch, defended.;
137.5;4;Marsh to Chandimal, FOUR runs rip-roaring flick off the pads! Marsh makes the ball tail, but Chandimal watches it carefully and then his hands come down on it with such power. The whip of the wrists sends the ball too wide for fine leg to even more;
137.4;1;Marsh to Lakmal, 1 run ah, short leg was almost in business. Marsh digs it in again, Lakmal blunts it to the right of Shaun Marsh. His little brother's frustrations boil over;
137.3;?;Marsh to Lakmal, no run short ball angled across the right-hander on middle and off, Lakmal ducks. Lovely line from the allrounder;
137.2;?;Marsh to Lakmal, no run digs it in on middle and leg, Lakmal evades it nervously;
137.1;1lb;Marsh to Chandimal, 1 leg bye on the pads, clipped to long leg;
136.6;?;Hazlewood to Herath, no run wears it high on the thigh - oh perhaps it's a little too high, he's got it on the box - as he attempts a flick. Cutter gets some extra bounce;Rangana Herath retired hurt 33 (103m 71b 3x4 0x6) SR: 46.47;
136.5;1;Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run good shot, in the way he kept his front foot aside and not letting himself fall over against a full inswinger on leg stump. Clipped to the left of midwicket, misfield allows the single;
136.4;?;Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run back of a length and outside off, no shot offered;
136.3;1;Hazlewood to Herath, 1 run clip to square leg;
136.2;?;Hazlewood to Herath, no run he plays the weirdest shots! His balance is on the front foot when the ball is short, but his hands know the correct shot to play. Slices it, and times the pants off it, straight to point;
136.1;1;Hazlewood to Chandimal, 1 run goes short, just for a change, Chandimal pulls to deep square leg. Just sat up for the shot.;
135.6;1;Marsh to Chandimal, 1 run now he gets the ball to shape away, but it's only a smidge so Chandimal can adjust. Actually, he uses it with a glide to third man;
135.5;?;Marsh to Chandimal, no run good length ball on off stump, defended;
135.4;?;Marsh to Chandimal, no run;
135.3;4;Marsh to Chandimal, FOUR runs inside edge! Ooof, Marsh yells into his shirt after managing some good, sharp inward movement to surprise Chandimal. He was looking to cut, ends up sending the ball to the fine leg boundary instead;
135.2;4;Marsh to Chandimal, FOUR runs that's what a batsman should look like when he goes over the leg side. Sees the length ball, opens his shoulders and heaves it away to midwicket;
135.1;1;Marsh to Herath, 1 run;
134.6;3;Hazlewood to Herath, 3 runs tally-ho! The ball is length, it has room, it is met with the wildest of mows over mid-on. Not entirely well timed, but it's a right sight seeing Herath mess up a big tall fast bowler. Warner races after the ball to stop it inches inside the boundary. Fine effort.;
134.5;?;Hazlewood to Herath, no run good length slid across the left-hander, Herath leaves and Hazlewood wonders why he ever decided to do what he is doing;
134.4;?;Hazlewood to Herath, no run plants that front foot down confidently and leaves outside his eyeline;
134.3;?;Hazlewood to Herath, no run fuller ball angled across the left-hander, defended;
134.2;?;Hazlewood to Herath, no run back of a length on off stump, nurdled into the leg side;

133.6;2;Marsh to Herath, 2 runs deliberately hit over the top of cover! He's spent enough time in the middle, and he is never shy of playing a shot or two. Takes a length ball and lofts it over the infield;
133.5;?;Marsh to Herath, no run good length ball, kept out;
133.4;?;Marsh to Herath, no run ooooh, that's too close for comfort! Marsh floats it up in the corridor, Herath bungles after it with an angled and horizontal bat. Could well have gone off the face to the slips. Instead, he is beaten;
133.3;1;Marsh to Chandimal, 1 run well played, the angle of the ball is coming into him, it moves in the air in the same direction, senses it early and flicks it to deep midwicket;
133.2;?;Marsh to Chandimal, no run angles it into the pads, Chandimal attempts a flick but his front foot was in the way. Some late movement for Marsh;
133.1;?;Marsh to Chandimal, no run good length ball outside off, pushed to short cover;
132.6;1;Holland to Chandimal, 1 run comes down the track and drives to long-on;
132.5;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run goes back and punches a flatter delivery towards point;
132.4;1;Holland to Herath, 1 run superb sweep! Holland is perhaps hoping to cut the angle down for that shot by bowling over the wicket, but he is so good at that shot. Picks the length and gets a long stride to get the leverage he loves;
132.3;1;Holland to Chandimal, 1 run comes down the track and drives to long-off. He walks across to the other end.;

131.4;?;Marsh to Herath, no run back of a length, pitching on off stump and Herath consciously makes his bat stay high over his shoulder. "Leave, leave. Just leave with the angle!";
131.3;?;Marsh to Herath, no run full and wide, Herath slaps it to extra cover. Went right off the bottom of the bat, so he changes it. Some drinks are run out to Chandimal too;
131.2;?;Marsh to Herath, no run dropped that's Smith's second today! Marsh manages to scourge up some movement through the air, his length is full enough that Herath is sucked into the drive, gets a regulation edge, gives a regulation catch and the Australian captain suffers a blooper.;
131.1;?;Marsh to Herath, no run well judged leave from Herath for that ball pitched on middle and off. Begun to take his batting very seriously over the last couple of years.;
130.6;1;Holland to Herath, 1 run fifty-partnership, achieved in streaky fashion as Herath is opened up while defending. Outside edge wanders away behind point;
130.5;1;Holland to Chandimal, 1 run;
130.4;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run flighted on middle and off, defended with soft hands and that helps because he gets an outside edge that goes straight to ground;
130.3;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run waits on his back foot because of the drift in, because he knows he has to play and because he knows there is turn. Squares himself up and blocks it;
130.2;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run flat and on a good length on middle, met with a full face;
130.1;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run flighted outside off, driven to short cover;

126.5;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run leans forward and blocks towards the off side;
126.4;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run did he get bat to that? No. Quicker ball beats the outside edge and the keeper. Chandimal could not get to the pitch of the ball and the quick turn does him;
126.3;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run positions himself beside the ball to unleash a pretty drive to point;
126.2;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run tossed up on middle and leg, defended;

125.4;?;Lyon to Herath, no run flighted on middle and off, defended;
125.3;4;Lyon to Herath, FOUR runs was actually beaten by the extra pace, but that somehow worked in his favour. He wanted to glance it off the face of the bat, the deflection is off the glove. Slider down leg does not work for Lyon;
125.2;?;Lyon to Herath, no run quicker and speared in on leg stump, blocked;
125.1;?;Lyon to Herath, no run shortish and outside off, slapped to backward point;
124.6;4;Holland to Chandimal, FOUR runs long half-volley, belted through extra cover! High backlift, full follow through.;

122.2;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run steps forward and blocks into the covers, lovely stride into the ball;
122.1;1;Holland to Herath, 1 run excellent batting. His side is dominant. They need quick runs. Takes a length ball and reverse sweeps to third mnan;
121.6;1;Lyon to Herath, 1 run that's Sri Lanka's 300, with Herath guiding a flighted delivery outside off to the right of short third man;
121.5;?;Lyon to Herath, no run attempts the cut, because the length is short, but the line is a little too close;
121.4;?;Lyon to Herath, no run finds the inside edge there as he continues firing the ball in at Herath, short fine leg comes in handy;
121.3;?;Lyon to Herath, no run oooh, very close to the outside edge. Angles the ball in on a good length and gets it to straighten past the forward prod;
121.2;?;Lyon to Herath, no run early recognition of the short ball outside off - Ranaga waits for it on the crease, like a predator in high grass - and cuts to point;
121.1;?;Lyon to Herath, no run lobs it up on off stump, gently patted back to the bowler;
120.6;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run shuts him out with a straight bat, which rests against his shoulder as he walks off for lunch, sweat pouring down his shirt. Evidence of a very accomplished innings.;
120.5;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run lunges forward and blocks on off stump;
120.4;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run lovely flight. He drags Chandimal forward on leg stump, but doesn't let him reach the pitch. The batsman does well not to push at the ball;

119.5;?;Lyon to Herath, no run judges the line to be outside off and again plays inside the line intentionally;
119.4;?;Lyon to Herath, no run quicker pace, good flight, looped up outside off, Herath hides his bat behind his pad, leaves, and sees the turn. He'd like that;
119.3;?;Lyon to Herath, no run flatter delivery on off stump, sliced to point;
119.2;1;Lyon to Chandimal, 1 run goes back and clips the ball to long leg, playing with the turn, playing the ball easy when its short;
119.1;1;Lyon to Herath, 1 run flighted on off stump, Herath blocks into the covers and runs. And he has to motor. He doesn't really motor with those brittle, cyborg knees, but he has to. Henriques could have had him with a direct hit;
118.6;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run stays back and blocks on middle and leg;
118.5;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run lunges forward on leg stump and blocks it;

117.4;?;Lyon to Herath, no run pulls his length and pace back just a touch, gets some turn as Herath opens his face towards point;
117.3;?;Lyon to Herath, no run that was a little closer for the sweep, flat and has the pace to work in Herath's favour, but it ducks under his bat outside off;

116.2;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run flighted on off sutmp, defended;
116.1;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run dropped by Smith at first slip! Beautiful bowling from Holland, his control of length on that was impeccable. Got it to loop up, and angle in on leg stump to draw him forward and into playing the ball. Then it pitches, turns, kisses the edge and goes past the keeper. The Australian captain has to move to his left, gets two hands and spills it;
115.6;1;Lyon to Chandimal, 1 run a leap, a punch, a raise of the arms and a wild yell! Looks like he's finally venting after 281 balls and over six hours of sheer patience. What a hundred! A deft little working of the ball behind square leg, Lyon made it easy on Chandimal. Provided him with exactly the ball he would like. Easy single. Eruption of emotion. Even included a flying kiss;

115.1;?;Lyon to Herath, no run tentative forward push from Herath.;
114.6;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run ooh, he liked that! Went after the loopy ball on off stump, but didn't quite have the room to play the drive with so horizontal a bat. Mistimes it back at the bowler;
114.5;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run tossed up on off stump, driven back at the bowler;
114.4;1;Holland to Herath, 1 run good length ball on off stump, Herath nudges it off the inside edge behind short leg and returns the strike to Chandimal on 99;
114.3;1;Holland to Chandimal, 1 run finds an inside edge through square leg that will carry him to 99. Natural variation for the left-arm spinner as the ball carries into the right-hander;

114.1;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run almost a yorker on middle, Chandimal digs it out by keeping his feet out of the way;
113.6;1lb;Starc to Chandimal, 1 leg bye back of a length, Chandimal looks for that dinky little leg glance again, long leg is still square. He doesn't get bat to it, but gets across to the other end. The umpire signals leg byes, as he should and Chandimal grins wryly.;
113.5;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run;
113.4;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run shortish and outside off, Chandimal slices it to the second gully again;

113.2;4;Starc to Chandimal, FOUR runs on the pads and Chandimal glances it fine! Only two short of a brilliant century now. Minor error from the bowler, perfect exploitation from the batsman. All he needed to do was place it to the right of the long leg fielder;
113.1;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run back of a length and outside off at 138 kph, Chandimal watches it through to the keeper;
112.6;4;Hazlewood to Herath, FOUR runs phew, what a strike. No fast bowler will be pleased with that outcome. Running in hard, bowling as quick as you can and then you look up to see the tail-ender slog you over midwicket with breathtaking authority. Punch in the gut for Hazlewood;
112.5;?;Hazlewood to Herath, no run things seem to happen when the tail is in. Back of a length ball, pitching outside off, and weaves away further. Herath didn't need to push at it, but he does and is beaten;
112.4;4;Hazlewood to Herath, FOUR runs that time he takes the outside edge, but Herath plays it with soft hands and manages to find the gap to the left of second slip. The fielder barely even moved, Australia look a tired, deflated lot.;
112.3;?;Hazlewood to Herath, no run a little wider of off stump and Herath spots it immediately. Lovely leave;
112.2;?;Hazlewood to Herath, no run beats the outside edge. Swing for Hazlewood as he pitches the ball up and watches it dart across Herath's flatfooted poke;
112.1;?;Hazlewood to Herath, no run back of a length on middle, Herath clips it to short midwicket;
111.6;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run good take from Nevill, moving to his left and diving across to rein in that wild bouncer down the leg side from Starc. Chandimal moved outside the line and just watches it go by;
111.5;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run full on middle, threatening to hold its line too at 143 kph, Chandimal pushes forward, is opened up a bit, but handles it well;
111.4;2;Starc to Chandimal, 2 runs looking for the slingy yorker on middle, ends up as a low full toss and it's drilled down the ground;
111.3;4;Starc to Chandimal, FOUR runs sublime shot! Australia left midwicket open, odd for this angle, and Chandimal flicks the ball in the air and through that region. Clever;
111.2;1;Starc to Herath, 1 run a little roar ushers Herath on as he wills himself across to the other end to get off the mark. Feet and arms working vigorously. Block into the covers from the crease gets him on his way;
111.1;?;Starc to Herath, no run starts with a wide one that Herath chases and misses.;
110.6;?;Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run gets some lift off a back of a length delivery bowled at his body. Chandimal attempts a flick, but is beaten for the lack of pace;
110.5;?;Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run good length ball outside off, no shot needed;
110.4;?;Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run lunges forward to defend into the off side, but a little nip back in gets the inside edge it was looking for again;
110.3;?;Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run good length ball on off stump, defended.;
110.2;?;Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run was that reverse? Hazlewood bowls fullish on fourth stump and it curls in late on Chandimal. His flick becomes an inside edge onto pad;
110.1;?;Hazlewood to Chandimal, no run rides the bounce on this 134 kph delivery outside off, steers it to backward point while swaying his body away to make room for the shot;
109.6;W;Holland to Perera, OUT straight to long-off. Some relief for Holland, he has a first wicket here . Perera leapt down the track and went through with his loft even through he was nowhere near the pitch. Wonder if he could have cut the ball had he stayed back and made room. Anyway, he was looking for the extra cover boundary, ends up hitting the ball straighter. Simple catch for Lyon;Dilruwan Perera c Lyon b Holland 16 (28m 25b 3x4 0x6) SR: 64;
109.5;2;Holland to Perera, 2 runs wild slog from Perera, who backs himself against the spinners. This time he gets away with an inside edge in front of square leg;
109.4;1;Holland to Chandimal, 1 run flighted on leg, Chandimal gets beside the ball and drives past the bowler. Good work with the feet and then he waited for the ball to come to him;
109.3;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run flighted on leg stump, blunted;
109.2;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run misses out a second time as a short ball is cut straight to point;
109.1;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run flighted outside off, driven firmly to short cover;
108.6;?;Hazlewood to Perera, no run another short ball, this one over off stump, Perera leaves warily. He's not going to be lunging forward any time soon;
108.5;?;Hazlewood to Perera, no run it may have been only 120kph, but that's a superb bouncer. On a slow deck, with rarely any bounce, he digs on in and it soars over the batsman's left ear. Looking all awkward taking evasive action. Excellent comeback from Hazlewood;
108.4;4;Hazlewood to Perera, FOUR runs that's emphatic! It's a length ball, it's peppered with width and it looks tasty enough for Perera that he launches it over the cover boundary.;
108.3;?;Hazlewood to Perera, no run stays in line with a back of a length ball at 134 kph, punched to mid-on;
108.2;?;Hazlewood to Perera, no run angled into the right-hander on a good length, Perera blocks;
108.1;?;Hazlewood to Perera, no run back of a length on fifth stump, steered to the slip, although not entirely intentionally. Inside edge off the late cut;
107.6;1;Holland to Perera, 1 run sliding down again and he flicks the ball to long leg and retains strike;
107.5;?;Holland to Perera, no run good length ball on the pads, worked away;
107.4;?;Holland to Perera, no run beauty. The front foot did not get far enough forward, and that made this look so good. Flatter delivery on leg stump, turns square and leaps over the stumps. No luck for Holland still;
107.3;1;Holland to Chandimal, 1 run drew him forward again, but he had pulled his length back just enough that Chandimal could not get to the pitch. Had to bring his wrists into play to keep the ball down. No leg slip;
107.2;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run on the pads again, gently defused towards midwicket;
107.1;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run tossed up on leg stump, Chandimal reaches the pitch of it and smothers the ball;
106.6;?;Hazlewood to Perera, no run good length ball on middle and leg, nudged away. And after 17 overs, we have our first drinks break of the morning. This Test has begun to move along quite nicely so do stick around.;
106.5;4;Hazlewood to Perera, FOUR runs so much for my theory about him not liking pace. Fullish length derives a little bit of swing into him, but that takes the ball right onto the middle of the bat. Cover drive from the top draw.;
106.4;?;Hazlewood to Perera, no run back of a length and outside off, steered to backward point.;
106.3;?;Hazlewood to Perera, no run back of a length and outside off, left to carry on;
106.2;?;Hazlewood to Perera, no run back of a length on off stump, blocked if he looks a little ungainly doing so. Takes a break to bring out a chest guard, which doesn't entirely please Smith;
106.1;?;Hazlewood to Perera, no run feet stay put but the hands swish down at the ball for a late cut to gully.;
105.6;1;Lyon to Perera, 1 run flicked away through square leg to retain strike. Wouldn't mind hitting Perera with some place now.;
105.5;4;Lyon to Perera, FOUR runs heavy hitting! That's his style of play, and it appears he does love spin bowling. Looks very adept coming down the pitch, taking the ball on the full and launching it over a flabbergasted Lyon;
105.4;1;Lyon to Chandimal, 1 run cramps him on leg stump, but that's an easy enough line for Chandimal, playing with the spin, playing it down and past short leg. Single every time;
105.3;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run leans forward and blocks;
105.2;6;Lyon to Chandimal, SIX runs awesome reverse sweep. Played that to death against India in Galle, and this is as violent a shot as you will see. Switched his stance, took the ball from middle and off and belted it over the point fence;
105.1;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run gorgeous line! He loops the ball wider of off stump, and that loop draws Chandimal forward. He can't quite reach the pitch, the ball drifts away, turns, takes the inside edge but manages to beat short leg to his left;
104.6;?;Holland to Perera, no run good length ball on middle, defended;
104.5;?;Holland to Perera, no run steps down and flicks to midwicket;
104.4;1;Holland to Chandimal, 1 run steps forward to a flatter ball on leg stump, turns it past short leg;
104.3;4;Holland to Chandimal, FOUR runs no more hanging around it seems. Chandimal rushes at Holland again, goes through with a slog and gets an inside edge that only barely evades midwicket;
104.2;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run presses forward and keeps it out;
104.1;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run ohhh, that would have been a bad way to go. Rushes down the track, yorks himself on leg stump and the ball dribbles off his toe towards the keeper. Nevill throws himself at it, but by that time Chandimal is able to get back to safety;
103.6;?;Lyon to Perera, no run flat, quick and at the stumps, Perera flicks to short leg;
103.5;?;Lyon to Perera, no run flatter and at the stumps, defended;
103.4;?;Lyon to Perera, no run steps down the track, a little too soon so Lyon pulls his length back and keeps the batsman for a defensive push;
103.3;?;Lyon to Perera, no run looped up on off stump, defended;
103.2;W;Lyon to Dhananjaya, OUT reward for persistence outside off. Lovely flight from Lyon, and his line is near perfect. It draws the batsman forward, drifts away, and dips on him whilst he tries to defend. Turns to put him in further trouble, takes the inside edge and a simple forward defensive becomes de Silva's undoing as he nicks to short leg. Walks off to a robust ovation - everyone in the dressing room is up on their feet. End of an outstanding innings. A classy innings;Dhananjaya de Silva c Marsh b Lyon 129 (325m 280b 18x4 0x6) SR: 46.07;
103.1;1;Lyon to Chandimal, 1 run lovely paddle sweep - it was on a length and outside off. A ball that was otherwise only going to be defended ends up as runs;
102.6;?;Holland to Dhananjaya, no run turns square, but again it is rather slow. Holland loops it up, and in on leg stump, it pitches full and veers away towards the slips. De Silva waits and waits and waits and plays it with soft hands;
102.5;1;Holland to Chandimal, 1 run makes him reach a little more outside off, that's good, plays with the open face, even better for Holland. But with the turn being so slow, Chandimal finds a single at point;
102.4;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run tossed up on leg, defended;
102.3;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run brings him forward on off stump this time, driven into the covers;
102.2;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run flighted on leg stump, defended;
102.1;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run lbw appeal but they were never going to get it. The bal pitched on leg stump and kept sliding on, Chandimal misjudged the line. Or perhaps he played for the turn;
101.6;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run tossed up on off stump, turned to short leg;
101.5;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run comes down the track and drives back at the bowler;
101.4;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run goes back and nudges the shortish ball on the stumps towards short leg;
101.3;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run good length ball outside off, defended;
101.2;4;Lyon to Dhananjaya, FOUR runs fierce! Another excellent show of footwork, moves swiftly down, doesn't let the bowler know of his intentions, reaches the pitch of the ball outside off and carts it to the long-on boundary;
101.1;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run goes back to one he should have gone forward to and the mistake gets the batsman to inside edge the ball. Persist right there, Lyno;
100.6;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run missed out there, perfect for the cut shot, Chandimal went for it, rocking back early and doing everything right, except perhaps waiting for the ball a little longer to place it behind point;
100.5;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run flighted on middle, the forward press gets an exhibition;
100.4;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run good length ball on off stump - a little turn, slow - eased away with the open face;
100.3;2;Holland to Chandimal, 2 runs worked away through midwicket, not much turn for Holland to worry about hitting against the turn;
100.2;4;Holland to Chandimal, FOUR runs beautiful shot! Set up by the footwork, running at the bowler and timing it so well that he couldn't adjust his length. Chandimal gets a full toss for his trouble and whips it past the right of mid-on to bring up the 200 partnership;
100.1;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run pushes back at the bowler as he meets a tossed up ball on leg stump after putting his front leg away;
99.6;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run little better with the length, but that time the line was a little too close to the stumps maybe. Closed face of the bat answers;
99.5;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run too easy to play off the back foot, especially for a right-hander with strong wrists against off spin;
99.4;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run a little too short, de Silva jumps back, gets on top of the bounce and plays with the slow turn;
99.3;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run defends in front of the stumps as Lyon gets a hint of turn. Oddly, it's not as much as yesterday;
99.2;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run goes back to a length ball just outside off and blocks it;
99.1;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run premeditated sweep from de Silva, which allows Lyon to adjust his length, bowl it shorter and wider outside off and deny him;
98.6;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run a touch shorter, a bit quicker, simply defended;
98.5;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run tosses it up on middle and off, blunted;
98.4;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run angles it into leg stump to see if he can get some bite from the pitch, not enough as Chandimal blocks solidly;
98.3;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run that's good. Pulls his length back just enough that Chandimal lunging forward can't reach it. A little turn, but handled well;
98.2;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run nice flight and drift onto middle, but it is perhaps a touch too full. Chandimal smothers it;
98.1;1;Holland to Dhananjaya, 1 run slips down leg side and de Silva helps it along to deep square leg;
97.6;1;Lyon to Dhananjaya, 1 run beautiful whip of the wrists as he plants his front foot towards the pitch of the ball and directs it to long-on;
97.5;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run protects his stumps with a straight bat;
97.4;1;Lyon to Chandimal, 1 run well tried, Smithy. He was at slip, spotted Chandimal going down for the paddle and raced across to his right. Dives, but can't quite make it;
97.3;1;Lyon to Dhananjaya, 1 run a little quicker, a little straighter and that gives the batsman the release he wants. They've been clipping balls past bat-pad for over a day now;
97.2;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run stands tall against a length ball on off stump and meets it with authority;
97.1;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run a touch on the shorter side, but he keeps the ball outside off stump. De Silva presses forward, reacts to the length and blocks it off the back foot;
96.6;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run was that the offcutter? Not unless it's a 143 kph one. And it didn't quite break off the pitch so just a normal, full ball on off stump, driven to mid-off;
96.5;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run shortish on off stump, blunted with ease;
96.4;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run good length ball on off stump, defended;
96.3;1;Starc to Dhananjaya, 1 run goes for the yorker but finds a full toss outside off stump. Ghastly thing. Sent to deep point to freshen up in the David Warner institute;
96.2;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run fuller ball outside off, driven towards mid-off;
96.1;4;Starc to Dhananjaya, FOUR runs shot! Should perhaps have been stopped on the fine leg boundary, Hazlewood moving slowly and tumbling on top of the ball instead of diving at it. But all in all, that flick deserved some applause. Stood up tall, met it with great authority and finished it with the bat high over his head. That's flair, boys;
95.6;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run excellent again, he's not allowing the batsman to reach the pitch with their front foots, but he is demanding them to move forward to the ball. A little turn, a little bounce and he could be in business. Here Chandimal's wrists help him keep the ball down;
95.5;1;Lyon to Dhananjaya, 1 run that's good bowling, Lyon's looping them up a wee bit outside off, to perhaps draw a cover drive. De Silva plants his front foot across and flicks to long-on;
95.4;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run steps forward to a good length ball on off stump, defended;
95.3;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run early judgment of length as he keeps to his crease, waits on the ball to arrive - excellent skill - and clips it behind square leg with easy as pie;
95.2;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run that's good, perhaps a little fuller might work. Loops the ball outside off, de Silva covers the line and plays it off the back foot;
95.1;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run flatter in length on middle and leg, picked away to short leg;
94.6;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run gorgeous, he's wrenched sideways movement out of his cold, dead pitch. Pitching on a good length, skirting across the right-hander, sucks him into playing an on-the-up drive and dances past the outside edge. Starc wipes his nose on his sleeve, looking like he wants to say, 'should have known';
94.5;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run looks calmer against pace, even if Starc is doing his best to summon as much as possible. 143 kph near-yorker on off stump met with a deft, and unforgiving, full face of the bat;
94.4;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run good batting, gets up tall against a short ball at his body and deflects it off his ribs to square leg;
94.3;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run back of a length and outside off, carries through to the keeper at ankle-height, Starc walks back with a disconsolate expression, kicks at the landing area. Hating cricket in general.;
94.2;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run 144 kph yorker just outside off stump, but it is defused with such ease and an angled bat that you wonder why a paceman would even bother running in here;
94.1;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run oooh, did that come in? Not exactly. Just cramps him on middle and leg, Chandimal almost plants his front leg across. Just about manages not to and push it to mid-off;
93.6;1;Lyon to Chandimal, 1 run turns his bat face, works his wrists to make sure to keep the ball down and away from short leg. Flat trajectory, but his line is outside off stump at least. Has to stay there for the turn he's getting;
93.5;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run quicker and flatter outside off, Chandimal brings his bat down in a hurry;
93.4;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run tossed up and angled into off stump, Chandimal flicks it to the right of the bowler;
93.3;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run attempts the sweep as he sees the ball outside off - Chandimal doesn't look as assured as he did yesterday, or as patient;
93.2;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run a hopeful query from the bowlers as Chandimal plays across the line, his front pad across and his bat having to come around it. Impact was outside off;
93.1;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run good bowling, starting outside off and dipping the ball before it reaches the bat. Chandimal defends well, with bat close to pad;
92.6;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run length ball slung outside off, no interest from the batsman;
92.5;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run firm block from the batsman on off stump;
92.4;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run good length on middle and off, a slower ball at 129 kph, de Silva judges it and blocks;
92.3;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run ooh, moved too far across there! Starc's pace is up, at 145 kph, the only threat that he can rely on in these conditions. But the length is short. de Silva tries the flick and misses;
92.2;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run beautiful straight bat comes down, but deflating news for Starc is that the ball is travelling very straight lines too.;
92.1;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run full, wide, teasing de Silva. de Silva says, yeah, fat chance with a proud leave;
91.6;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run ah, the old faithful. Chandimal almost seems to miss it when he doesn't play it. The sweep, to a flatter ball. Lyon spotted the batsman premeditating and changed his length, but the line was down leg enabling the shot. Starc does extremely well, throwing himself to his left to stop a boundary at fine leg;
91.5;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run beautiful bowling. That's almost the length from which he swept, but this time he plays with a straight bat and gets an inside edge because the ball dips and turns;
91.4;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run good judgment of length and trajectory again, and the feet move in accordance to it. Back and across for a tuck to short leg;
91.3;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run a little shorter in length, Chandimal is deep in his crease with a closed bat face;
91.2;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run flighted delivery just outside off, reaches the pitch and tonks it down;
91.1;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run used that liberally to counter the offbreak from pitching outside off and darting in at him. Sweeps him to short fine leg;
90.6;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run a little loss in patience? Starc slids onto the pads and de Silva clips it to square leg. His timing on that shot continues to astound. Shoots to the fielder;
90.5;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run lovely line again! Probing along the fifth stump, hoping for de Silva to poke away from his body. Unfortunately, the man has an opener's temperament so he doesn't even bother about bothering with it;
90.4;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run it's remarkable that a left-armer can delivery such a wide delivery and still remain a threat. de Silva understands it well and doesn't fish outside his off stump;
90.3;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run so Starc takes his anger out on the bat that dares to stand against him, nailing a yorker outside off and taking a bit of wood off with it as de Silva chops down on it. Heat: 143 kph;
90.2;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run a forward defensive shot so firm that it would rip the heart right out of a bowler.;
90.1;?;Starc to Dhananjaya, no run good length, at a gentle 140 kph to warm up with, de Silva judges the line to be outside off and nods to it as it goes to the keeper;
89.6;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run good length ball, kicks up at Chandimal, who tries to defend but is beaten on the inside edge. The ball hits his pad and leaps over short leg. And that is that;
89.5;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run nudged behind square leg;
89.4;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run good length ball on off stump, defended;
89.3;1;Lyon to Dhananjaya, 1 run flighted just outside off, played with soft hands and manages to one-up the extra bounce and the short leg;
89.2;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run flighted on off stump, defended solidly;
89.1;?;Lyon to Dhananjaya, no run good length ball turning back at him from outside off, but the shortish length allows him to go back and handle the turn nicely. Tucks it behind leg gully;
88.6;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run presents the full face of a good length ball on off stump, gets an outside edge towards point and Chandimal sinks to his knees;
88.5;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run good length ball outside off, driven into the covers;
88.4;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run leans forward to a tossed up ball and blunts it;
88.3;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run flighted on off stump, defended into the covers;
88.2;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run flighted on middle, defended;
88.1;?;Holland to Chandimal, no run good length ball outside off, steered to point;

De Silva has called for some refreshments. He had been cramping a while before, but of course, it could be a tactic to waste time too. Sri Lanka wouldn't want to face any more overs today than they need to
 Innings Start
4.51pm A solid comeback from SL after a solid morning from Australia. Herath's six-for almost makes this a two-day, one-innings Test. Sri Lanka will have to bat for five overs this evening.
Tushar: "26/5 for both the teams. For Sri Lanka at the start of the innings and for Australia at the end of the innings."
125.1;W;Herath to Holland, OUT gone. Herath takes six. What a champion effort. Flight outside off, loads of it. Holland looks to drive and gets a thin outside edge which deflects from Kusal's gloves into Mathews' hands, sticks in his right hand.;Jon Holland c Mathews b Herath 1 (8m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;
124.6;1;Perera to Holland, 1 run pushed into the off side for a run;

123.6;?;Herath to Holland, no run the carrom ball outside off, too wide, left alone;
123.5;W;Herath to Hazlewood, OUT wow, this is some bowling. Herath takes yet another five-for. What bowling. Sooo much flight outside off, draws Hazlewood forward and despite the ball pitching quite full, it spins enough to go through a thin gap between pad and bat. From the rough. Clips the top of off stump.;Josh Hazlewood b Herath 0 (6m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
123.4;?;Herath to Hazlewood, no run phew, slow outside off, Hazleood looks to drive but the ball spins through the gap. Keeper can't collect wither;
123.3;1;Herath to Starc, 1 run flatter on middle, turned to deep midwicket;
123.2;?;Herath to Starc, no run a wild swing. Flight from Herath on middle and leg. Starc stays in his crease and heaves but misses;
123.1;?;Herath to Starc, no run flight outside off, popped back towards the bowler;
122.6;?;Perera to Hazlewood, no run flight on off, a solid block;
122.5;?;Perera to Hazlewood, no run shortish and wide, slides on with the arm but too wide to draw a stroke or cause any trouble;
122.4;?;Perera to Hazlewood, no run ooh nice. Slow on middle and off, a thick outside edge falls short of gully. Nicely bowled;
122.3;?;Perera to Hazlewood, no run slow and wide, left by Hazlewood;
122.2;W;Perera to Lyon, OUT one more. Lyon falls. A short delivery on leg, quite slow. Lyon goes back to look to clip to square leg but gets a thin inside edge onto his pad. The ball pops up for short leg to take, and he cannot believe he has got an easy catch;Nathan Lyon c Mendis b Perera 3 (11m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
122.1;1;Perera to Starc, 1 run more flight on middle, drilled to long-on. Good batting, all these singles adding up;
121.6;1;Herath to Starc, 1 run short and wide outside off, too slow. Starc goes back and cuts to deep point;
121.5;1;Herath to Lyon, 1 run swept to a fine deep midwicket or a square square leg. Just one. Good field from Mathews;
121.4;?;Herath to Lyon, no run fullish on off, quicker, 80 kph. Pushed back.;
121.3;1;Herath to Starc, 1 run nicely driven towards long-off;
121.2;1;Herath to Lyon, 1 run just short of square leg. Flat on off, Lyon sweeps again, fails to keep it down. Just short;
121.1;1;Herath to Starc, 1 run frightful power. Tossed up outside off, Starc gets on one knee and clobbers his drive/swat to long-off;
120.6;?;Perera to Lyon, no run flat down leg, Lyon misses;
120.5;1;Perera to Starc, 1 run flight on off, pushed towards long-off. Nice stroke, good place to hit the ball;
120.4;1;Perera to Lyon, 1 run ouch! Kusal hasn't had a great day. Flat, full on off. Lyon nails his sweep this time but straight into short leg's helmet/shoulder. Pops up and shouts of "catch" ensue;
120.3;?;Perera to Lyon, no run sweeps to short fine leg. Too full to sweep.;
120.2;?;Perera to Lyon, no run too much flight, half-volley, bunted back;
120.1;1;Perera to Starc, 1 run flight outside off, powerfully smashed to long-on;
119.6;?;Herath to Lyon, no run flat on off, Lyon gets low to sweep, obviously, but ends up way too early through his stroke. A bit of glove;
119.5;W;Herath to Marsh, OUT straight to the man. Marsh cannot believe what he has done. A sharp catch at short leg. A slowish delivery but full enough on leg. Marsh went back, instead of forward, and realised only too late of his error in judgement. Tried to fatally check his flick but it ended up in short leg's hands who took it easily. Nice low catch, aided by the trust in Herath's accuracy, staying in position;Mitchell Marsh c Mendis b Herath 53 (117m 92b 9x4 0x6) SR: 57.6;
119.4;?;Herath to Marsh, no run slow on leg, Marsh gets across to block;

119.1;?;Herath to Marsh, no run fuller, pushed through on leg, a thick inside edge onto the pad;
118.6;1;Perera to Marsh, 1 run lovely batting. Full on middle, too full so Marsh opens the face and drives to long-off;
118.5;?;Perera to Marsh, no run short on off, Marsh goes back and pushes to midwicket. Better pace from DP;
118.4;1;Perera to Starc, 1 run pushed to long-on;
118.3;?;Perera to Starc, no run flatter on off, blocked;
118.2;?;Perera to Starc, no run flight outside off, Starc gets low and looks to send this into the stands with his heave. Doesn't take into account some spin and us beaten;
118.1;?;Perera to Starc, no run flat and full, blocked;
117.6;?;Lakmal to Marsh, no run good length on off, another solid block to the 134 kph delivery;
117.5;2;Lakmal to Marsh, 2 runs ooh, streaky, full outside off, this one didn't come back as much as Marsh anticipated. His uppish drive skews behind point;
117.4;?;Lakmal to Marsh, no run brings this one back in towards off, Marsh's defensive technique intervenes;

Superb bowling, slows it up so much outside off, draws Smith forward, the ball pitches on off after drifting in and spins away sharply. Kusal takes off the bails quickly, has Smith got something behind the line? I really don't think so. Close, but nothing behind the line. Is there too much doubt? More and more replays being viewed. Part of the foot is behind the line in the air, but nothing grounded. Out is the call. What a start to this new ball from SL.
