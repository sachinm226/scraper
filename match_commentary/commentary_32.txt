 Innings Start
Brendan: "Why is that not a run-out, considering it came off the bat? I know a run was not being attempted, but if a defensive shot goes to bat-pad then is flicked back onto the stumps it's a run-out - does the wicketkeeper make a difference in the scorebook?" -- Apparently it does.
Henry: "Henry hit ball before Paine whipped the bails off. Should it be a run out rather than stumped? " -- No, because the batsman wasn't attempting a run
Innings break Lyon takes five! His first five-wicket haul at the SCG and his first against New Zealand. Australia will bat again. A superb performance from Lyon. He also dropped Phillips twice off his own bowling. But he was all over the Black Caps. They made a number of starts but no one went on like Labuschagne did for Australia. This was be a tricky hour for Australia's batsmen. Hemant will step in for the last hour.

56.1;W;Cummins to Taylor, OUT Given lbw! Taylor starts to walk and then reconsiders. He reviews. No bat, he was trapped on the crease but was he hit outside the line? He wiped across the line with an angled bat. Nothing on hot spot or RTS. Ball tracking says impact is umpire's call and it's hitting off stump flush! It stays out! He was squared up by a full delivery angled into off, and he just got in a tangle half forward. Bat came down at a terrible angle.;Ross Taylor lbw b Cummins 22 (37m 20b 4x4 0x6) SR: 110;

49.2;W;Cummins to Latham, OUT a soft dismissal, Latham departs for 49. Australia have two in last three balls.

48.6;W;Lyon to Raval, OUT 89kph, much better, fuller at the stumps. Raval comes forward and looks to defend. It was pitched on the off stump and beat the inside edge to hit the pad. An appeal for lbw and given straightaway. Raval is having a chat with Latham and he chooses to review, just in time, at least that's what Aleem Dar reckons although it looked like the 15-second timer was over. Front foot is fine, no bat either, the only question is if it was sliding down. No, would have gone on to hit the leg stump. New Zealand lose the review as well as their second wicket;Jeet Raval lbw b Lyon 31 (70m 58b 4x4 0x6) SR: 53.44;

56.1;W;Cummins to Taylor, OUT Given lbw! Taylor starts to walk and then reconsiders. He reviews. No bat, he was trapped on the crease but was he hit outside the line? He wiped across the line with an angled bat. Nothing on hot spot or RTS. Ball tracking says impact is umpire's call and it's hitting off stump flush! It stays out! He was squared up by a full delivery angled into off, and he just got in a tangle half forward. Bat came down at a terrible angle.;Ross Taylor lbw b Cummins 22 (37m 20b 4x4 0x6) SR: 110;

54.5;?;Head to Taylor, no run 81kph, flighted outside off, comes forward and blocks;
54.4;4;Head to Taylor, FOUR runs fuller and tossed up wider. Slapped away through covers for four. That might hamper the chances of another over before lunch;

52.1;4;Pattinson to Taylor, FOUR runs short of length, enough room outside off, Taylor rocks back and cuts it square of the wickey;
51.6;?;Lyon to Phillips, no run fuller around off, comes forward and smothers it;
51.5;?;Lyon to Phillips, no run length ball on middle, defends it on the leg side;
51.4;?;Lyon to Phillips, no run drops a sitter. Tossed up around off, the ball dips at the batsman who ends up chipping it back towards Lyon. Hits the right thumb and on to the ground. Lyon getting some treatment for his bleeding thumb;

49.6;?;Cummins to Phillips, no run fuller around off, comes forward and blocks;
49.5;?;Cummins to Phillips, no run a slower short one but down the leg side, doesn't bounce much either. Paine fails to make a clean stop but recovers well to prevent any run;

49.2;W;Cummins to Latham, OUT a soft dismissal, Latham departs for 49. Australia have two in last three balls.

48.6;W;Lyon to Raval, OUT 89kph, much better, fuller at the stumps. Raval comes forward and looks to defend. It was pitched on the off stump and beat the inside edge to hit the pad. An appeal for lbw and given straightaway. Raval is having a chat with Latham and he chooses to review, just in time, at least that's what Aleem Dar reckons although it looked like the 15-second timer was over. Front foot is fine, no bat either, the only question is if it was sliding down. No, would have gone on to hit the leg stump. New Zealand lose the review as well as their second wicket;Jeet Raval lbw b Lyon 31 (70m 58b 4x4 0x6) SR: 53.44;
