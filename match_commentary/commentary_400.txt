9.30: The slide began with the Powerplay and Pakistan not only failed to reach 200 but they also fell way short of their allotted 50 overs. The batting Powerplay has been a problem for them in recent times - they lost control in an ODI in Colombo recently and collapsed spectacularly. Even well-set players like Umar Akmal looked lost. Starc led the way with his five-for and his round the wicket line was effective in stifling the batsmen. A combined effort from the seamers who have bowled superbly in this humidity.
Don't write off Pakistan yet. The pitch is getting a bit slow and their spinners will be a handful. Australia will have to sustain their energy late into the night. Could be an interesting chase. Join us at 10.15.
Amin: "Even with 8 batsmen, we cannot bat for full 50 overs. I think that's shameful." We've had a few mails saying the same.

Pattinson to start off
5.50pm: Starting in ten minutes. A warm welcome to Mazher Arshad, for his stats alerts. This is what he has for us: "This is Pakistan's Nelson ODI (111th) at Sharjah, the most they have played at any venue - also the most any team has played away from home. Next are Gaddafi Stadium Lahore (48) and National Stadium Karachi (39)."
Kamran (not Akmal), writes: "In recognition of Mr Akmal gracing us with his presence, here are some famous Akmal remakes: 1. Go ahead Kamran, make my day! 2. I love the smell of dropped catches in the evening. 3. "We'll always have Sydney".
Cricketing Minds isn't happy with the selection: "It is so disappointing to see a talented bowler like Junaid Khan miss out despite proving his quality in the recent Test series vs SL. Cheema and Tanvir are strictly OKAY bowlers. Poor decision by Dav & Misbah."
And so is Mehmood: "I feel Pakistan are a bowler short. They have turned their attacking strength (bowling) into a defensive strategy to play an extra batsman. It clearly sends a message of weakness to the opposition."
Well I was very impressed very Junaid in Sri Lanka. Bit surprised to see him miss out.
The first of possibly many mails on Kamran Akmal. Here's Hassan: "glad to see Akmal back. how long before a drop catch. More then the outcome the game focus is on Akmal's catching!"
Anil Katwal: "Last time Pak beat Aus in a series was way back in 2002. Shahif Afridi and Shoaib Malik were part of that team."
Toss: Misbah has won the toss and Pakistan will bat first. Two fast bowlers and three spinners are in and so is Kamran Akmal. Clarke's not that disappointed to be bowling first. He says it's cooler than yesterday.
One change from the previous game. Xavier Doherty makes way for Dan Christian. "Wade's pretty fit, so the batting order stays the same," says Clarke. Let's see how he holds up after 50 overs.
For Pakistan, the seamers are Cheema and Tanvir. Nasir Jamshed is in. He wasn't part of the one-dayers in Sri Lanka because of injury. Remember, no Younis or Gul for this series.
5.25: Toss is on in five minutes. Pakistan are expected to pack their team with spinners as usual. Read the preview for today's game here.
Waqar on the weather: "Look, we played two Tests here and it was 50 degrees then. They should just get on with it."
5.15pm: Good day everyone and welcome to the coverage of the first ODI between Pakistan and Australia in Sharjah. It's 36 degrees at the moment and this is a 6pm start. Let's hope that temperature drops for the sake of everyone involved.
Pitch: Looks dry, of course. It's a win the toss and bat first pitch. Australia should fancy doing that if they win the toss because should be more swing later on at night.
Best to call it night and not 'evening.' I think either team will be relieved that Shoaib Akhtar and Brett Lee have retired. Fancy facing either of them at 1am? No thank you. I hope the players have squeezed in enough sleep though, and fans too.
 Innings Start
Presentation: Loads of prizes being give out. This could take the whole night.
Mitchell Starc is the Man of the Match: "There was a little bit on the pitch. We all bowled well tonight, full credit to out batters, it wasn't easy out there."
Misbah: "Bowlers have done a wonderful job for us. We should have scored 230, but our batsmen messed up. The spinners bowled well. We were 30-35 runs short. We're repeating the mistakes from SL."
Clarke: "The Pakistan spinners bowled well. Ajmal's quite hard to pick. We will look at footage of him and look to play him better. I thought it was a bit cooler tonight. I think we handled the conditions better tonight."
That's it from us here. Thanks for the mails. You can read the match report once it's updated. Cheers!
End of match: That ends an absorbing low-scoring contest. Australia really had to slog for this. To overcome Pakistan's spinners in such conditions is no joke, but Clarke and Bailey showed that it could be done, even if it meant using up 50 overs.
Pakistan will look back at this and point to the fact that they failed to bat out 50 overs. Who knows what might have happened if they had added at least 20 more? Their bowlers and fielders did the best they could. The batsmen didn't. Stay with us for the presentation.
