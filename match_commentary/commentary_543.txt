Pakistan will rue the fact that they didn't bat out 50 overs. 207 is competitive, but the Australians will back themselves to chase it down. Pakistan, on this pitch, will again bank on their spinners to do the job.
The seamers started it for Australia, and Hauritz bowled well in the middle overs to keep the run-rate in check. Wickets fell at fairly regular intervals, and the Pakistan batsmen struggled to get partnerships going. Had it not been for that late flourish from Shoaib, they wouldn't have passed 200. Their bowlers, though, have a fighting score to defend, but Australia would have worked hard on the areas they faltered in the last game. Join us in some time for what should be a very interesting run-chase.

43.2;1;Laughlin to Umar Gul, 1 run missed run out, Haddin was really horrible, swatted to mid-off, an accurate throw all along the ground to the striker's end as Shoaib is struggling to make it, and he lets it through, a bit of a bad bounce but he should have collected that;

2.58 pm: Right, the players are out. Butt and Shehzad will open, and starting the proceedings for Australia is Bracken. All set! Two slips in place
Vikram: "Let's see if little Dougie can perform even better than he had did in domestic one-dayers. I would like to see him open with Bracken."
The lovely Mayanti Langer's on screen now, quite a distraction, and she's speaking to James Hopes who's lamenting about the way Australia have played in the ODIs recently. Chin up!
Fawwad: "I think Pakistan too has to make a point here. It does'nt matter if they won last time, we all know it was not an easy win for them. The Batting has to be good and i guess a score of 250 would really test the australians against the spinners."
2.40 pm: Experts believe spinners have a lot to gain. The pitch is hard and dry, though they are a little cautious this time, not quite calling it a belter like they did in the first game.
First comment of the day in from Chris: "Lets hope the Australian batsmen can actually do something productive today, no more excuses!" You'll have to wait for a bit, though. They have to make sure they do well with the ball first.
2.26 pm: We'll get you the details from the toss shortly. The news is that Pakistan have won the toss and opted to bat. Nasir Jamshed is out injured, and in comes Ahmed Shehzad, who makes his debut. Three changes for Australia. Shaun Marsh is replaced by David Hussey; Ben Hilfenhaus and Stuart Clark make way for Ben Laughlin and Doug Bollinger. So still no Sohail Tanvir.
2.20 pm local time: Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the second ODI being played at the fantabulous Dubai Sports City Stadium. Australia were spun out in the first game for a paltry score, and though they fought back to make Pakistan work hard for their runs, 169 never seemed a threatening target.
Australia have had a fairly bad run in the shorter format of late, losing ten ODIs in less than four months since the start of the year. Our Stats Editor S Rajesh analyses their slump in detail here. It was almost as if Pakistan were playing in Lahore or Karachi, with a strong crowd of around 18,000 - still below capacity - turning out to support their team. Shoaib Akhtar looked the main draw, but didn't impress.
However, Shahid Afridi and Saeed Ajmal proved more than a handful, and Australia should have drilled hard at the nets, facing their spinners, in trying to put in a much improved effort in their second outing. There's a while to go before the toss, so read the preview in the meantime.
 Innings Start
Australia paced their innings perfectly, first with the stand between Hopes and Watson, and then between Symonds and Clarke. Two quick wickets, one to Ajmal and the other to Afridi, put the two teams on even terms at one stage but a fluent Symonds, supported by a shaky, yet determined Clarke saw Australia through. The spinners, particularly Ajmal, were dealt with much better, though their variations were not up for display as often as they were in the first match. Clarke and Symonds used their feet to spin, something that was absent in the first game, and in the end, got home fairly easily. We'll get back to you with the details from the presentation shortly .
Some cash-prizes being given away. Unimportant ones, for hitting the board, for the number of fours struck etc. Andrew Symonds, unsurprisingly, is the Man of the Match.
Symonds: "It's a difficult wicket, a bit two-paced. We had a couple of partnerships that held us together. I had a bit of time to practice my batting, so it all went well today."
Younis Khan: "They had some good partnerships, while we had very few of those. If we had around 230-240, it could have been close. Today there was quite a bit of dew as well, which didn't help much."
Michael Clarke: "Better feeling today. We did well to restrict them, the bowlers did a fantastic job. We started well with James Hopes and Shane Watson chipping in well."
Keeping it short, these guys. That's all we have from here. Thanks for sending us all your feedback. Don't forget to tune in for the next game in Abu Dhabi on April 27. Until then, it's goodbye from all of us at Cricinfo.
