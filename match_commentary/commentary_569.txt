 Innings Start
Australia win by 170 runs. The players shake hands, hugs and cheers from the crowd, a convincing win for Australia. They now lead the series 1-0. Excellent bowling performance from the Australian's, Hauritz picking up five wickets, Johnson three and Bollinger two in the second innings. Pakistan have to reflect on their batting performance and make few changes before the second Test at Sydney.
Hauritz: "Lot was set up by the batting, we were able to set attacking fields, the straighter deliveries worked well for me."
Johnson: "Feels good, thinking positively about my bowling and doing the right thing."
Yousuf: We did not play well in the first innings. Very good conditions to play cricket and a good wicket. On Umar Akmal and Aamer, they are exciting players to watch."
Ponting: "It is a nice thing to have most wins as captain under my belt. we are happy how the things are going. First innings bowling was outstanding, and the bowling today was excellent. On Hauritz, his performances has been very good, and we will be going to Sydney, his home ground."
Watson the Man-of-the-Match: "A game which a player dreams on. It is nice to share the ups and downs with the family. Few more runs and few more wickets will be useful and I am happy opening my batting."
That's it from here, it has been a pleasure bringing you the ball by ball coverage of a fascinating Test match, thank you for all the emails. Do join us for the second Test at Sydney. On behalf of Siddhartha Talya, David Walsh, Gopi Rangarajan and Sanjay Murari, this is Binoy George signing off.
