And no respite as the fielders amble out to warm-up ... to a background of fireworks from the top of the O'Reilly stand. England are 8-1 to win this ... tight odds. Smoke drifting across the outfield ...
Innings break Massive hitting from Australia there, murdering England's attack. Quality stuff, very entertaining to watch and they had bighitters right down the order.
England didn't help themselves with some average fielding at times, including two gaffesque drops. Vaughan's return as captain, though, was strangely encouraging - he was upbeat and seemed to be enjoying himself out there and his field placements were decent - for what they were worth, Australia often clearing the field with a record number of sixes.
Now let's see if Australia's bowlers can wipe the smile off his face though - their batsmen certainly had a good go. If this is any consolation at all for England, Australia's total isn't a record for all Twenty20 matches ... Somerset made 250 in 2006.
Martin will be back to take you through the next ten overs.
19.6;1;Anderson to White, 1 run worked to square and Anderson has the worst analysis of any bowler in Twenty20 internationals (1 for 64 from his four overs);
19.5;2;Anderson to White, 2 runs dropped into space at deep midwicket;
19.4;6;Anderson to White, SIX runs that's into the Ladies Stand there, over long-on, and that extends the sixes record;
19.3;2;Anderson to White, 2 runs Pietersen carbon-copies Lewis's drop earlier when Ponting was on 16 out at long-on. KP grins at the crowd, sheepishly;
19.2;6;Anderson to White, SIX runs huge, huger, hugest! That goes big over midwicket and it's fluffed in the crowd;
19.1;?;Anderson to White, no run yorker, good start but fluffs the chance to run out Symonds at his end;
18.6;2;Flintoff to Symonds, 2 runs worked to long-on and that's some great running from the pair;
18.5;1;Flintoff to White, 1 run short and sharp and that pings off the glove into the grille. Ouch. "Well bowled Andrew Flintoff" announces Nasser Hussain. Flintoff checks if White is OK;
18.4;2;Flintoff to White, 2 runs yorker, driven off the back foot to cover and that brings up the 200;
18.3;4;Flintoff to White, FOUR runs rocketed through extra cover off the back foot and that's smashed away, scorcher;
18.2;1;Flintoff to Symonds, 1 run tries the yorker, but there's a touch of width and that's cut off the back foot behind point;
18.1;?;Flintoff to Symonds, no run dot ball at 85mph (137 kmh) as Symonds plays under that one, trying to cut it;
17.6;6;PD Collingwood to White, SIX runs clattered over midwicket and Dalrymple has a one-handed attempt to leap up and get that but it goes over him and just clears the rope. He was two yards in, if he'd have been on the ropes he'd have had that. As it is, that's the 12th six, equalling the record in a Twenty20 international;
17.5;1lb;PD Collingwood to Symonds, 1 leg bye slower ball, strays down leg and Symonds can only get a leg on it as it goes to the man up at fine leg;
17.4;2;PD Collingwood to Symonds, 2 runs yorker, worked out to midwicket and it's thrown back in on the bounce;
17.3;1;PD Collingwood to White, 1 run slower delivery and he tries to heave that one over to midwicket, mis-times it and Nixon trotting into the leg-side to field it;
17.2;1;PD Collingwood to Symonds, 1 run low full toss, worked out down the ground to Pietersen on the long-on boundary;
17.1;1;PD Collingwood to White, 1 run gives himself room to cut that down the ground for one;
16.6;2;Lewis to Symonds, 2 runs huge! That's a flat bat swipe right over mid-on;
16.5;4;Lewis to Symonds, FOUR runs straight, but Symonds stands tall and walks back, making room to send that up and over through point;
16.4;1lb;Lewis to White, 1 leg bye tries to hook that one as well, but the ricochet goes in front of gully to Vaughan;
16.3;6;Lewis to White, SIX runs whack! Lovely shot in front of midwicket and that's just inches over the boundary;
16.2;?;Lewis to White, no run short and tries to hook that through midwicket, doesn't get hold of it, though;
16.1;1;Lewis to Symonds, 1 run wide, full and that's worked in front of point off the back foot;
15.6;1;PD Collingwood to Symonds, 1 run attempted yorker and they push hard, looking for two, but it's not on;
15.5;1;PD Collingwood to White, 1 run slower ball again, off cutter, worked to gully and Vaughan wings that back in underarm while diving;
15.4;?;PD Collingwood to White, no run;
15.3;1;PD Collingwood to Symonds, 1 run pushed up there and Symonds rushes that out to mid-on;
15.2;4;PD Collingwood to Symonds, FOUR runs low full toss, worked off the legs through square with a bottom-hand flick and that goes all the way - strength and placement;
15.1;4;PD Collingwood to Symonds, FOUR runs slower ball, wide and clattered with a one-bounce four through extra cover, driving right through that one;
14.6;1;Lewis to Symonds, 1 run attempted yorker worked out to the man at long-on;
14.5;1;Lewis to White, 1 run dabbed down off the back foot down to third man;
14.4;?;Lewis to White, no run defended on the front foot;
14.3;?;Lewis to White, no run wide down the leg side and there's an appeal for a strangle, but it clearly flicked the outside of the pad;
14.2;W;Lewis to Clarke, OUT short, just outside off and that's some sharp work in close from Collingwood, winged right back in over the stumps and Nixon who does the rest. Mix up of the yes, no, wait, sorry variety;Michael Clarke run out (?Nixon/Collingwood) 5 (5m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33;
14.1;2;Lewis to Clarke, 2 runs guided behind point off the back foot and that's good running from Australia;

In comes Cameron White - the big hitters just keep on coming

So the Twenty20 has gone the way of Australia's Ashes campaign - total and utter dominance from the home side, abject humiliation for the visitors. The victory makes it played five, won three for Australia in this form of the game. And now they've put down a marker for the one-day series with England and New Zealand. The positives for England are that Vaughan's comeback was a pretty decent one for him and the sprightly youngster Nixon, 36, looks a real find. The teams line up now to shake hands, Flintoff trying to suppress a smile at the sheer hopelessness of it all. But the real smiles are on the faces of the Australian players - they may have dismissed this as a bit of fun, but tonight they had a lot of fun. Thanks for joining us today - do join us again for the one-day series which gets underway on Friday, when these two teams meet again, this time at the MCG.
