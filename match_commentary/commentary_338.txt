Data
So it's just 215 on the board for England. Way below what they will have wanted. The only silver lining for them at the moment is that the cloud cover is still around so they have to make that count this evening. It's been a wonderful day, so for, for Australia, led by Peter Siddle. The bowling wasn't always consistent, but they produced some good deliveries, were donated a few wickets and caught well.
fdarren: "could be worse-could be a kent fan"
58.6;W;Pattinson to Swann, OUT that's a pretty fitting way to end the innings, Swann just prods a catch to cover from a short of a length delivery that he poked at with no intent at all;Graeme Swann c Hughes b Pattinson 1 (16m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
58.5;?;Pattinson to Swann, no run back of a length, defended back down the pitch;

57.6;?;Starc to Anderson, no run big appeal for lbw, given not out and Clarke reviews. Sounded like an edge. In fact, it's two pads and this will be close...ooh, close! Umpires call on hitting, just taken the outside of leg so stays on field;
57.5;?;Starc to Anderson, no run bouncer, very short, Anderson barely has to duck;

57.1;W;Starc to Bairstow, OUT castled! Now it's reward for Starc. Full at off stump, Bairstow plays around it and the pole flies backwards.

56.6;?;Pattinson to Swann, no run full and wide to Swann first ball, left alone and bounces twice to Haddin;
56.5;W;Pattinson to Broad, OUT all the good work undone. A bit dim from Broad who gets sucked in by a short ball which he top edges and Pattinson himself steadies under the catch on the on side;Stuart Broad c & b Pattinson 24 (32m 30b 5x4 0x6) SR: 80;
56.4;?;Pattinson to Broad, no run banged in short, comes fairly gently off the surface and defends square on the off side;

56.1;?;Pattinson to Broad, no run short of a length, defended with a hop into the off side;
55.6;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run he was nearly late on this, it hinted to shape back into the batsman, but he comes down in time and defends to mid-off;

55.3;4;Starc to Bairstow, FOUR runs short and wide, Bairstow cashes in by going over the top of point...always his intent to go in the air. There hasn't been much for short today;
55.2;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run comes forward again, Starc keeping it full, drives off a thick inside edge to midwicket;
55.1;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run full on middle and off, driven neatly by Bairstow but mid-off skips around;
54.6;?;Pattinson to Broad, no run another sharp bouncer to finish with, 85mph, and Broad is hopping about a bit but gets under it well enough;
54.5;?;Pattinson to Broad, no run this time it's a fantastic take by Haddin, diving down the leg side as this one swings past Broad's pads and it kept moving;
54.4;?;Pattinson to Broad, no run now a play and a miss...Broad aiming another big drive, misses out the edge and Haddin fumbles as well;
54.3;4;Pattinson to Broad, FOUR runs flayed! Frees is arms again and takes advantage of a full delivery without quite the previous venom and unfurls a thunderous cover drive...200 up for England;

53.6;1;Starc to Broad, 1 run whips a full delivery from around middle stump out to deep square to keep the strike;

51.3;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run searching outside off again, and swinging it away, Bairstow leaves this alone;
51.2;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run straighter and swinging away, Bairstow shapes to play and then drags the bat back towards him to leave the ball alone;
51.1;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run full and wide of off, Siddle is still getting some outswing, Bairstow probably should have left that in the last over before tea but he nibbled at it, just ended up pushing it away to point;

50.5;?;Starc to Broad, no run full and straight, Broad pushes it back to Starc;

49.2;W;Siddle to Prior, OUT Siddle has five! That's not his best ball of the day, but Prior has authored his own downfall with a terrible shot. Short and wide outside off, Prior's eyes have lit up and he's gone the big cut but straight to the man at point. It's Phil Hughes, and he takes the catch above his head.;Matt Prior c Hughes b Siddle 1 (6m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;

46.3;?;Agar to Bell, no run very full and turning, Bell shoulders arms and interestingly the square-leg umpire has asked for a replay after Haddin gives half a shout for a stumping.

24.5;?;Pattinson to Pietersen, no run full and straight, it's met with a straight bat from Pietersen, who can't beat mid-off;
24.4;1;Pattinson to Trott, 1 run straighter ball from Pattinson and Trott works a quick single to midwicket, who is deep enough to allow it;
24.3;?;Pattinson to Trott, no run straighter bat from Trott now as he defends down the pitch;
24.2;4;Pattinson to Trott, FOUR runs another beautiful cover drive from Trott. He's looking in really good form. Pattinson got some swing away but Trott played just the right line and his placement was perfect.;
24.1;1;Pattinson to Pietersen, 1 run banged in short on leg and Pietersen keeps this one down, works a single behind square;
23.6;4;Starc to Trott, FOUR runs well played Jonathan Trott, for the first time in the over he gets some width outside off and pounces, punching a lovely drive through cover for four;
23.5;?;Starc to Trott, no run that's an exceptionally ambitious appeal from Starc. It starts down leg and swings further down, but the Australians still ask the lbw question.;
23.4;?;Starc to Trott, no run wrong line from Starc, down leg side and Trott doesn't get anything on it;
23.3;?;Starc to Trott, no run some inswing from Starc, but he started this one a little too far to leg and Trott gets an inside edge onto pad;
23.2;?;Starc to Trott, no run full and straight, Trott keeps it out easily;
23.1;?;Starc to Trott, no run swings down leg side;
22.6;?;Pattinson to Pietersen, no run woah! What a brave leave from Pietersen. Must not have missed off stump by much, I wonder if he expected it to swing away - in fact it just held its line;
22.5;?;Pattinson to Pietersen, no run left alone outside off, a bit straighter from Pattinson;
22.4;?;Pattinson to Pietersen, no run Haddin has had some work to do this over, dives across in front of first slip to clutch a very wide ball from Pattinson;
22.3;?;Pattinson to Pietersen, no run pushed away to the off side;
22.2;4;Pattinson to Pietersen, FOUR runs oooh, is that a chance for Haddin? Yes - a very tough one though! Pattinson swings it down leg, Pietersen glances fine off the face of the bat and Haddin has to dive a long way to his left. The thing is, he actually made his ground but the ball died on him and went under his gloves. Would have been a magnificent catch if he'd got it.;
22.1;?;Pattinson to Pietersen, no run Pattinson also gets the ball to move away, but it's too wide to tempt Pietersen into playing;
21.6;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen gets off the mark with a nudge through off, but again there was some late swing from Siddle;
21.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run edgy from Pietersen, this one angles in and he turns it towards leg, but not off the meat of the bat at all;
21.4;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run wider and shorter, and moving away off the seam now instead of in the air. Pietersen is not interested;
21.3;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run another good ball, curving away a fraction, and it's pushed to point;
21.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run again Siddle gets the ball to swing away a little bit, and late, and Pietersen edges it down towards the finer of the two gullies;
21.1;W;Siddle to Root, OUT got him! The yorker does the job! Siddle gets his line right first ball from this end and the length is spot-on as well. Perhaps just a little hint of swing away and Root plays the wrong line, losing his off stump.;Joe Root b Siddle 30 (99m 64b 6x4 0x6) SR: 46.87;
20.6;?;Pattinson to Trott, no run very straight from Pattinson, very straight bat from Trott;
20.5;?;Pattinson to Trott, no run left alone outside off;
20.4;?;Pattinson to Trott, no run a little bit of tail in there from Pattinson, it's fullish and on off stump, Trott drives it back towards the bowler;
20.3;?;Pattinson to Trott, no run well wide of off, Trott leaves it alone;
20.2;4;Pattinson to Trott, FOUR runs on the pads, wrong line entirely and Trott's score will race along if Australia keep bowling there. He clips it through midwicket with ease;
20.1;?;Pattinson to Trott, no run good line outside off and it's left alone;
19.6;?;Agar to Root, no run fuller and turning away, it's left alone;
19.5;4;Agar to Root, FOUR runs Agar drops too short here and that's a golden opportunity for Root to cut it away to the boundary, he gets the placement right and makes no mistake;
19.4;?;Agar to Root, no run drifts onto the pads, clipped away behind square leg;
19.3;?;Agar to Root, no run a little shorter now, gives the ball a chance to turn just a fraction, but Root handles it easily with a push to off;
19.2;?;Agar to Root, no run just outside off, no real turn and Root drives it to cover;
19.1;?;Agar to Root, no run drifting down leg side and this is pushed away safely;
18.6;3;Siddle to Root, 3 runs beautiful shot, just looks like a defensive push but it's timed well enough past the bowler that he picks up three;
18.5;1;Siddle to Trott, 1 run Siddle slips this one down leg and it's clipped away by Trott;
18.5;1nb;Siddle to Trott, (no ball) left alone outside off;
18.4;1;Siddle to Root, 1 run fuller and a hint of outswing, Root goes for the square drive but Agar shows his fielding skills with a terrific dive at point to prevent a boundary;
18.3;?;Siddle to Root, no run outside off, no real movement, and Root defends again. Siddle's radar is improving a little now;
18.2;?;Siddle to Root, no run again Siddle angles it in and Root defends;

17.5;?;Agar to Trott, no run fullish and just outside off, Trott pushes it back to Agar;
17.4;?;Agar to Trott, no run better line now on off stump but it doesn't really turn and Trott meets it with a straight bat;
17.3;4b;Agar to Trott, 4 byes again Agar gets the angle wrong, this beats Trott, it beats Haddin, and it's four byes;
17.2;?;Agar to Trott, no run Agar has his first real appeal now, as Trott misses a clip to leg, but this one was drifting well down;
17.1;?;Agar to Trott, no run bad ball from Agar, down leg, but Trott miscues and gets a leading edge that fortunately for him drops well short of the bowler;
16.6;4;Siddle to Root, FOUR runs another loose ball releases any pressure as Root clips it off his pads and through midwicket, a diving attempt in the deep from Pattinson can't prevent this from reaching the boundary;
16.5;?;Siddle to Root, no run swinging away from outside off but it's too far outside - left alone;
16.4;?;Siddle to Root, no run ah, this time Siddle beats the bat, it's a little shorter and just outside off, not moving away from the bat at all but Root plays inside it all the same;
16.3;?;Siddle to Root, no run that's a better ball, just outside off and it's defended;
16.2;2;Siddle to Root, 2 runs straight - too straight from Siddle. It's comfortably worked away to deep midwicket;
16.1;?;Siddle to Root, no run Siddle gets some outswing now but Root is good enough to cover it and pushes it firmly to the off side;
15.6;?;Agar to Trott, no run a yorker-length ball to finish, it's on middle stump and Trott clips it straight to midwicket;
15.5;?;Agar to Trott, no run pushed away to the off side but can't beat the field;
15.4;?;Agar to Trott, no run shouts of 'catch it' now as Trott gets a thick inside edge onto his pad but it heads safely into the ground;
15.3;?;Agar to Trott, no run straighter now, just a little bit of drift but no turn, it's defended;
15.2;?;Agar to Trott, no run a better length now and turns it away, Trott leaves the ball alone;

14.5;?;Siddle to Trott, no run well wide of off from Siddle and an elaborate shouldering of arms from Trott;
14.4;?;Siddle to Trott, no run this one is left alone outside off, that will reduce Trott's strike-rate a fraction;
14.3;?;Siddle to Trott, no run straight again from Siddle, no real movement, and Trott works it to mid-on;
14.2;2;Siddle to Trott, 2 runs too leg-side-ish from Siddle now and Trott clips it through midwicket, Hughes is there but he fumbles and it costs Australia a couple of runs;
14.1;4;Siddle to Trott, FOUR runs Siddle draws an edge from Trott but it's safely down into the ground and runs away between the slips and gully for a boundary;
13.6;?;Starc to Root, no run Root comes forward to meet this delivery, which is wide of off, and he drives but can't beat the field;
13.5;4;Starc to Root, FOUR runs well played Joe Root, he gets some width from Starc and it's short enough for the batsman to cut hard and straight down into the ground, it runs away behind point for a boundary;
13.4;?;Starc to Root, no run full and angling in towards off stump, almost a one-day type of delivery from Starc, and Root keeps it out;

13.2;?;Starc to Root, no run no swing this time, Root defends from off stump;
13.1;?;Starc to Root, no run lovely ball, full and swinging in to middle stump, Root keeps it out;
12.6;?;Siddle to Trott, no run the silly mid-on is in action as he drives to his left to cut off another well-struck drive from Trott;
12.5;?;Siddle to Trott, no run better from Siddle, on middle and off but not so full, Trott defends on the walk;
12.4;?;Siddle to Trott, no run gets outside off, Trott onto the front foot and defends;
12.3;4;Siddle to Trott, FOUR runs more super timing from Trott, Siddle goes full at the stumps and it's drilled through mid-on with a punchy drive...was, in fact, taken from around off stump;
12.2;4;Siddle to Trott, FOUR runs that's a poor ball, though, way outside leg stump and Trott actually does quite well to catch up with it and flick it perfectly between long leg and deep square;
12.1;?;Siddle to Trott, no run starts on a length, defended back to the bowler;
11.6;?;Starc to Root, no run defended back to the bowler...a solid maiden from Starc;

9.1;?;Starc to Root, no run defended to the off side;
8.6;W;Pattinson to Cook, OUT gone! Pattinson strikes. Edges a loose drive to Haddin. Full outside off stump, Cook will be angry that he was drawn into playing. Pattinson lets out a roar of delight, he's got the man who scored 766 runs the last time these sides met in the Ashes. After that wayward first over he's caused a few problems;Alastair Cook c ?Haddin b Pattinson 13 (41m 26b 2x4 0x6) SR: 50;

JK: "David Warner has had a word with them bowlers!"
 Innings Start
So England can breathe a huge sigh of relief to have finally ended the innings but goodness me what a turnaround from 117 for 9. No-one could have imagine something like that would happen for the final wicket but Phil Hughes and Ashton Agar have put Australia right in the game.

64.5;W;Broad to Agar, OUT back of a length, pulled and...got him!! Oh no, caught in the deep. A miscue aiming to the midwicket boundary but didn't get it and Graeme Swann came in and took a low catch.

46.1;?;Anderson to Agar, no run good start from Anderson, fullish and a hint of inswing, Agar drives but doesn't time it;
45.6;?;Swann to Hughes, no run wider of off and turning away, Hughes shoulders arms. He's happy for Agar to face up at the other end, and why wouldn't you be?;
45.5;?;Swann to Hughes, no run quicker and flatter, trying to get through the defence of Hughes, but he keeps it out;
45.4;?;Swann to Hughes, no run Swann is getting plenty of drift, but Hughes defends comfortably;
45.3;?;Swann to Hughes, no run defended safely to point;
45.2;?;Swann to Hughes, no run drifting in and Hughes defends, at times he doesn't look as solid as Agar at the other end, but they are both getting the job done;
45.1;?;Swann to Hughes, no run Hughes defends from off stump;
44.6;?;Finn to Agar, no run defended away to point this time;
44.5;4;Finn to Agar, FOUR runs Finn goes full this time, which is where he should be bowling, but Agar is up to the challenge and pushes a crunchy drive through point, it has run away almost to the boundary - in fact, the dive from the fielder hasn't saved it;
44.4;?;Finn to Agar, no run defended away safely to the off side;
44.3;4;Finn to Agar, FOUR runs more short stuff, and more runs for Agar. He has gone for the hook and found the gap between the men at deep square leg and fine leg. It's all looking a bit too easy for Agar here;
44.2;1;Finn to Hughes, 1 run Hughes gets some width from Finn, he tries for a cut but doesn't time it, though still picks up a single;
44.1;?;Finn to Hughes, no run Finn is over the wicket to Hughes, who defends from off stump;
43.6;?;Swann to Agar, no run ah, this one beats the outside edge! Good ball from Swann, turning it just enough;
43.5;?;Swann to Agar, no run fuller ball now and Agar drives to the off side;
43.4;4;Swann to Agar, FOUR runs more runs for Agar, it was tossed up outside off by Swann and Agar has driven it confidently through cover for another boundary;
43.3;1;Swann to Hughes, 1 run a little shorter from Swann, Hughes goes back and drives through the gap at cover;
43.2;?;Swann to Hughes, no run defended once more from on the stumps;
43.1;?;Swann to Hughes, no run Swann continues to attack the stumps, drifting in from around the wicket, but Hughes defends;
42.6;2;Finn to Agar, 2 runs clipped through the leg side - and I do mean through, because the fielder at midwicket has misfielded and turned a single into a two;
42.5;?;Finn to Agar, no run Agar goes for a square drive now but can't get this past the man at point;
42.4;?;Finn to Agar, no run short once again, but this time Agar decides to duck it instead of playing;
42.3;4;Finn to Agar, FOUR runs more runs for Agar! Finn bangs it in short again and Agar, as he has shown all innings, has no fear of the bouncer, pulls it over square leg for four more runs. Really poor bowling, that;
42.2;?;Finn to Agar, no run driven straight to cover along the ground;
42.1;1;Finn to Hughes, 1 run on the pads now and Hughes tucks it through the leg side for a run;
41.6;?;Swann to Agar, no run quicker from Swann, good ball, attacking the stumps, but it's defended;
41.5;?;Swann to Agar, no run Agar goes for a cover drive now but can't find the gap;
41.4;?;Swann to Agar, no run slower and wider from Swann, Agar leaves it alone;
41.3;6;Swann to Agar, SIX runs take that, says Ashton Agar! You could see him wind up early for this, lofts it beautifully over long-off for six.;
41.2;?;Swann to Agar, no run defended safely to off;
41.1;?;Swann to Agar, no run Agar uses his feet now and dances down the pitch - drives to cover;
40.6;1;Finn to Agar, 1 run nope, full and wide of off, and pushed away towards cover;
40.5;1;Finn to Hughes, 1 run Hughes drives confidently to deep point and is happy to pick up another single - that brings up Australia's 150;
40.4;?;Finn to Hughes, no run this time Finn does just that - pitches it up more and Hughes dabs, but the ball sails past his edge;
40.3;3;Finn to Agar, 3 runs short from Finn again, and Agar pulls it safely past square leg and picks up three runs;
40.2;?;Finn to Agar, no run this bouncer does get up more, but Agar is a tall man and has no trouble getting behind that ball and defending it down into the ground;
40.1;?;Finn to Agar, no run Agar tries to pull again, but that short ball didn't get up as much as he expected, it sails just over the stumps and dies on the way through to Prior;
39.6;?;Swann to Hughes, no run clipped to midwicket and can't find a gap;
39.5;?;Swann to Hughes, no run ah, half a chance there? No, I don't think so. This one from Swann drifts in and turns more, Hughes gets the edge and Trott at slip dives to his left and stops the ball - on the bounce I think;
39.4;?;Swann to Hughes, no run straight again, Hughes drives it back to the bowler;
39.3;?;Swann to Hughes, no run Hughes tries to punch this one past backward point but finds the fielder;
39.2;?;Swann to Hughes, no run safely defended again, not a huge amount of turn here for Swann;
39.1;?;Swann to Hughes, no run Swann drifts the ball in from around the wicket, Hughes defends;
38.6;1;Finn to Hughes, 1 run nudged away towards deep point this time for a single and Hughes will retain the strike;
38.5;4;Finn to Hughes, FOUR runs lovely pull from Hughes! Finn goes the short ball but it's not quick enough to trouble Hughes, who pulls in the air safely forward of midwicket. Easy runs;
38.4;1;Finn to Agar, 1 run on the pads now and Agar tucks a single to fine leg;
38.3;4;Finn to Agar, FOUR runs Finn tempts Agar with a fullish ball angled across him and Agar is up to it, he drives behind the man at cover point and finds the boundary. Good shot - played it late and along the ground;
38.2;?;Finn to Agar, no run short from Finn, and Agar goes for the pull - he misses everything though;
38.1;1;Finn to Hughes, 1 run pushed away to deep point for an easy single, and Hughes trusts Agar enough to give him the strike;
37.6;4;Swann to Agar, FOUR runs nicely played, Agar paddles this sweep very fine and picks up a boundary - clever shot;
37.5;?;Swann to Agar, no run quicker again, cut away to point;
37.4;?;Swann to Agar, no run quicker from Swann, on the pads, defended;
37.3;?;Swann to Agar, no run big appeal here, first for caught behind, which is turned down, and then for a stumping as the ball turns past Agar's bat. The third umpire, Marais Erasmus takes a very long time over this one. Agar dragged his foot out of the crease but it's one of those ones where at the point the bails came off, it was hard to be sure if any of Agar's foot was grounded behind the line. Chances are he was out, but the footage wasn't quite conclusive enough and I can understand Erasmus giving Agar the benefit of the doubt;
37.2;1;Swann to Hughes, 1 run a little shorter now and Hughes cuts to deep point, he's happy to take a single and give Agar an opportunity;
37.1;?;Swann to Hughes, no run drifting in from around the wicket, Hughes defends;
36.6;?;Anderson to Agar, no run fuller from Anderson, defended safely by Agar;
36.5;4;Anderson to Agar, FOUR runs good shot, Agar gets a straight ball that is not actually all that full, but he's timed his straight drive perfectly and that runs away to the boundary;
36.4;1;Anderson to Hughes, 1 run an adventurous sort of pull from Hughes, just brings him a single;
36.3;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run good ball, angled across Hughes and it narrowly beats the outside edge;
36.2;1lb;Anderson to Agar, 1 leg bye Agar works a single away to the leg side and gives Hughes the strike;
36.1;?;Anderson to Agar, no run Anderson is around the wicket now, defended away to the leg side;
35.6;?;Swann to Hughes, no run again Hughes cuts a shorter one but again he can't beat point;
35.5;?;Swann to Hughes, no run a little shorter from Swann, Hughes cuts to backward point and can't beat the field;
35.4;?;Swann to Hughes, no run ah, this time Swann tempts Hughes wider of off and turns it away enough, Hughes dabs at it and is lucky not to tickle an edge to the keeper;
35.3;?;Swann to Hughes, no run drifting in from around the wicket once more, defended;
35.2;?;Swann to Hughes, no run nice curve again from Swann, again Hughes defends with a straight bat;
35.1;?;Swann to Hughes, no run Swann drifts it in towards the stumps, Hughes defends;
34.6;1;Anderson to Hughes, 1 run slower ball from Anderson and Hughes chips it up towards midwicket, but not near enough to a fielder to be a chance;
34.5;4;Anderson to Hughes, FOUR runs Hughes is looking for some quick runs, advances a little and gives himself room, drives this uppishly through cover for four;
34.4;1;Anderson to Agar, 1 run crunch! Agar has decided not to defend any longer, he pulls hard and miscues it slightly, it lobs over the head of the bowler and they just take a single. Could have come back for more, but Hughes seemed to want the strike;
34.3;?;Anderson to Agar, no run again Anderson makes him play, again Agar defends;
34.2;?;Anderson to Agar, no run good, accurate stuff from Anderson, just a little inswing and targeting the stumps, Agar defends;
34.1;?;Anderson to Agar, no run watchful from Agar as he defends, but it was a bit quicker than he expected, nearly got through him;
33.6;1;Swann to Agar, 1 run tossed up outside off and Agar drives through cover for a single, the fielder ensures there won't be two there;
33.5;?;Swann to Agar, no run defended solidly to the off side;
33.4;W;Swann to Pattinson, OUT gone this time though, played forward and given out lbw struck on the front pad bang in front and the arm ball has done the trick. Pattinson has reviewed but it's in vain surely, yep that's smashing leg stump and there was no inside edge. Swann beating the inside edge this time and Pattinson is a goner;James Pattinson lbw b Swann 2 (5m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
33.3;?;Swann to Pattinson, no run back on his stumps, another huge cry for lbw, not out given again, this was probably sliding down leg;
33.2;?;Swann to Pattinson, no run a lunge outside off stump, the turn away from the bat beats him;
33.1;1lb;Swann to Hughes, 1 leg bye swept from off stump, struck on the back pad, huge lbw appeal, not out given, no review and Hawk Eye has it hitting just outside the line and going over too, good decision;
32.6;?;Anderson to Pattinson, no run around the wicket now, length ball that Pattinson leaves outside off and it's not too far away from the off stump;
32.5;?;Anderson to Pattinson, no run fuller in the channel outside off, shoulders arms;
32.4;2;Anderson to Pattinson, 2 runs back of a length and pushed firmly at and runs it through the covers to bring the deficit under 100;
32.3;?;Anderson to Pattinson, no run length ball just outside off again, left alone again;
32.2;?;Anderson to Pattinson, no run similar line but Pattinson leaves this alone;
32.1;W;Anderson to Starc, OUT poked at again just outside off and another edge, this time straight to Prior and Anderson has five wickets, what an effort this morning from him. It was a full ball that ran across the left-hander who had a dabble at it outside off an got a feather edge. Starc didn't move his feet and it might have shaped away from him a little with another hint of reverse swing;Mitchell Starc c ?Prior b Anderson 0 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
31.6;?;Swann to Hughes, no run a touch fuller, played forward and runs it out to point;
31.5;?;Swann to Hughes, no run pushed out on the off side once again coming forward;
31.4;?;Swann to Hughes, no run tossed up more and blocked forward up on the off side;
31.3;?;Swann to Hughes, no run shuffles across and tries to flick through the on side but finds backward square leg;
31.2;?;Swann to Hughes, no run played forward again on the stumps, tried to work it towards the on side but couldn't;
31.1;?;Swann to Hughes, no run full on off stump, blocked up the wicket coming forward;
30.6;?;Anderson to Starc, no run left alone to a ball not too far from the off stump angled across Starc;
30.5;?;Anderson to Starc, no run full just outside off, pushed at and dropped at second slip that is a dolly shelled by Graeme Swann. Simple as you like down low with two hands and it bounced straight out, a rarity indeed but that was poor;
30.4;?;Anderson to Starc, no run very full just outside off stump, driven and gets it to extra cover without timing;
30.3;?;Anderson to Starc, no run length ball, strikes the hip and runs towards square leg;
30.2;W;Anderson to Siddle, OUT back of a length just outside off, poked at edged and caught behind superb diving catch by Prior down to his right, fine grab. This time it left the right-hander a little, Siddle followed it outside off stump and Prior took off and claimed it very well a full stretch down to his right-hand side. Mastery of swing bowling evident again from Anderson, first one in, then one away, superb;Peter Siddle c ?Prior b Anderson 1 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
30.1;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run off stump, this shapes in a little, blocked up the wicket;
29.6;?;Swann to Hughes, no run played back and pushes up the wicket from off stump;
29.5;?;Swann to Hughes, no run forward and pressed back to the bowler from off stump;
29.4;1;Swann to Siddle, 1 run this slides on and beats the outside edge this time, playing forward was Siddle and he nicked it but Prior would have done exceptionally well to take that, it runs off his pad towards short long leg;
29.3;?;Swann to Siddle, no run a shimmy down the wicket and drives to the right of mid off;
29.2;?;Swann to Siddle, no run full just outside off, blocked forward to cover, met it on the full;
29.1;W;Swann to Haddin, OUT turns in from outside off and Haddin is bowled big turn from two feet outside off to take the off stump as Haddin played back, big moment for England. That really went, the first ball that has really spun. Haddin was playing back to a just back of a length delivery, he looked to play perhaps a little too square and that cost him as the turn totally deceived him and he lost his off stump;Brad Haddin b Swann 1 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
28.6;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run off stump, played forward and blocked up the wicket towards mid-on;
28.5;4;Anderson to Hughes, FOUR runs poor ball, short and wide, Hughes helps himself and guides it backward of point, that is in the slot for Hughes;
28.4;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run underway immediately by running a full ball on the stumps through midwicket;
28.3;W;Anderson to Smith, OUT drives at this and edges it behind where did that come from? I think it moved a little and look a thin edge to Prior. From looking gun-barrel straight in the preceding overs this morning, this has just shaped a little away from Smith driving, admittedly a touch loosely outside off stump, he got a feather edge and Prior took it low down. The ball might have actually just wobbled off the pitch rather than in the air;Steven Smith c ?Prior b Anderson 53 (98m 79b 7x4 1x6) SR: 67.08;
28.2;?;Anderson to Smith, no run full and wide and Smith swings at it and misses, it was very wide and he didn't quite lean out to it as he might have done;
28.1;?;Anderson to Smith, no run blockhole ball, Hughes gets down on it and digs it back to Anderson;
27.6;?;Swann to Hughes, no run covered up around off stump and played back up the wicket;
27.5;1;Swann to Smith, 1 run down the track again, drives down to long on;
27.4;?;Swann to Smith, no run down the wicket again, pushed into the off side again, just finds extra cover here;
27.3;?;Swann to Smith, no run slightly short outside off, cut and gets it to backward point;
27.2;?;Swann to Smith, no run floated up well outside off and left alone;
27.1;4;Swann to Smith, FOUR runs down the wicket first ball and carved in-to-out past extra cover, really nicely played and that's the first half-century of the match and back-to-back Ashes fifties for Smith;
26.6;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run played back and tucked from just back of a length with the angle to square leg;
26.5;4;Anderson to Hughes, FOUR runs full just outside off, flicks this past extra cover, very nicely steered into the gap and has timed it much better than it appeared, it races away from Kevin Pietersen and runs for four;
26.4;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run full again, blocked firmly back to the bowler, more dug out this from off stump;
26.3;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run fuller and driven, gets it to mid-on;
26.2;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run a touch straighter on a decent length, forward and runs it with the angle towards square leg;
26.1;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run full on off stump, blocked forward up into the covers;
25.6;?;Finn to Smith, no run forward again to a similar ball, manages to get plenty of bat on this and blocks it up the wicket;
25.5;?;Finn to Smith, no run forward to a full ball, appeal for lbw but it was outside the line and the umpire says nope;
25.4;?;Finn to Smith, no run very full on the stumps, blocked back to the bowler;
25.3;4;Finn to Smith, FOUR runs short and wide and cut for four, worst delivery of the morning and put away well;
25.2;1;Finn to Hughes, 1 run very full at middle stump, Hughes down on it, dabs it into midwicket and they take a quick run;
25.1;1;Finn to Smith, 1 run swivelled down to long leg from just back of a length at the body;
24.6;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run full on the stumps again, Hughes tucks to midwicket again;
24.5;4;Anderson to Hughes, FOUR runs length ball, slides wide of the off stump, punches in front of point, nicely timed, got on top of the bounce and put it away well;
24.4;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run full on the stumps again, blocked back up the wicket;
24.3;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run full length on the stumps again, tucks this to square leg;
24.2;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run full on the leg stumps, strikes the pad and slides towards square leg;
24.1;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run forward and dropped from just outside off into the covers for a sharp single, well ran;
23.6;4lb;Finn to Hughes, 4 leg byes at the hip again and Hughes tickles it down the leg side, just out of Prior's reach;
23.5;1;Finn to Smith, 1 run back of a length at the body, pulled in a controlled fashion and gets it down to long leg where Trott fields and saves two;
23.4;?;Finn to Smith, no run very full on the stumps, dug out towards midwicket who slides to his right and saves the single;
23.3;1;Finn to Hughes, 1 run played forward on middle and off, it runs off a thick inside edge down to long leg;
23.2;?;Finn to Hughes, no run full ball just outside off stump, blocked coming forward into the covers;
23.1;4lb;Finn to Hughes, 4 leg byes back of a length on the hip and it comes off the pad past Prior for four, that's what you get with Finn, a touch loose sometimes;
22.6;?;Anderson to Smith, no run touch wider, on the same length, shoulders arms to this;
22.5;?;Anderson to Smith, no run off stump and blocked again on the front foot;
22.4;?;Anderson to Smith, no run good length on off stump, blocked on the crease back to the bowler;
22.3;?;Anderson to Smith, no run full on the stumps, driven again with a nice flow of the bat, gets it to mid-on;
22.2;?;Anderson to Smith, no run a touch fuller just outside off, driven at, gets it to extra cover;
22.1;?;Anderson to Smith, no run length on off stump, Smith forward and pushes back to the bowler;
21.6;3;Finn to Smith, 3 runs back of a length, pulled and forces it over midwicket, doesn't get all of it but there's the first runs of the day;
21.5;?;Finn to Smith, no run comes forward and pushed hard at just outside off, gets a thick inside edge to midwicket;
21.4;?;Finn to Smith, no run around off stump on a good length, Smith forward and presses off the inner half of the bat to midwicket;
21.3;?;Finn to Smith, no run leg side again, Smith pushes at this and misses;
21.2;?;Finn to Smith, no run length a couple of feet outside off stump, left alone;
21.1;?;Finn to Smith, no run poor ball, leg side and easily ignored;
20.6;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run padded away! Hughes lunges forward and thrusts his front leg at the ball, it was wide enough to risk, though, Anderson and the England team go up in appeal but umpire Dharmasena isn't interested. England, wisely, elect not to review ... and that is the final ball of the day, as stumps are pulled with Australia 75 for 4 and 140 runs in arrears;
20.5;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run round the wicket again to Hughes, slightly short of a length and defended from the crease;
20.4;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run straight line, shaping back and whipped through square for another single;
20.3;1;Anderson to Hughes, 1 run length ball, on middle and off, worked wide of mid-on and they scamper through for one;
20.2;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run goes across his stumps and jabs defensively into the leg side;
20.1;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run pitched up on the stumps, turned to the man at square leg;
19.6;?;Swann to Smith, no run spin and bounce but Smith was forward and prods it safely back on to the turf;
19.5;?;Swann to Smith, no run angled in, covers his stumps and defends;
19.4;?;Swann to Smith, no run tossed up, comes forward again and drives into the ground back to the bowler;
19.3;4;Swann to Smith, FOUR runs full and flighted and in the slot for Smith to punch with a high front elbow for four through extra cover;
19.2;?;Swann to Smith, no run flatter and quicker, again blocked back down the track;
19.1;?;Swann to Smith, no run tossed up and blocked on the front foot;
18.6;?;Finn to Hughes, no run angled across on a good length and Hughes taps back on the off side;

18.3;1;Finn to Hughes, 1 run straight, good length, Hughes closes the face and nudges one in front of square leg, who throws on the run but isn't close to running out the batsman at the non-striker's end;

18.1;?;Finn to Smith, no run short of a length, defended around the line of off;
17.6;?;Swann to Hughes, no run more excitement as Hughes swats at the ball like a man trying to deter a wasp from his jam sandwiches, no chance for Cook at silly point and there's an excellent diving stop at cover to prevent a run;

17.4;1;Swann to Smith, 1 run yells of "catch it!" from Swann as Smith skips forward to clip wide of the man at short midwicket, though it was only briefly in the air;
17.3;?;Swann to Smith, no run plays back this time, plenty of action on the delivery as it spins it, tapped to leg;
17.2;?;Swann to Smith, no run spinning back in off and length, hits bat and pad, outside the line of off, though that doesn't prevent a half-hearted appeal;
17.1;?;Swann to Smith, no run tossed up, wide of the stumps, Smith leaves the crease and smothers it;
16.6;2;Anderson to Hughes, 2 runs angled across on a length, not doing quite as much through the air now, Hughes stays back and dabs a couple through the covers;
16.5;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run too straight and Smith walks across to clip a length deliver in front of square leg;
16.4;?;Anderson to Smith, no run good length, in the channel outside off stump, defended;

15.6;?;Swann to Smith, no run flatter, spinning in a touch, Swann gets excited as the ball bounces and hits the glove, I think, but drops on to the pitch;
15.5;?;Swann to Smith, no run length ball, gets forward to defend into the off side;
15.4;6;Swann to Smith, SIX runs floated up, plenty of air and Smith skips forward to meet it with a hefty clump that sails all the way over long-on. Well, that's one way to deal with the spinner;
15.3;?;Swann to Smith, no run pushed through outside off, doesn't turn and Smith tucks his bat behind his pad;
15.2;1;Swann to Hughes, 1 run straighter, going on with the arm, worked off the pads through square leg for a single that gets Hughes off strike;

14.4;?;Anderson to Hughes, no run slightly back of a length outside off, defended solidly on the back foot;
14.3;W;Anderson to Rogers, OUT speared in and hit in front, Rogers again pulled across his stumps ... up goes Dharmasena's finger but Rogers reviews! The angle was quite exaggerrated but this only has to be clipping and Hawk Eye suggests it was, Rogers has to drag himself away! Anderson's hard work in probing outside off pays off as Rogers fell over his front leg, missed a straight one, though it was only a stump shaver;Chris Rogers lbw b Anderson 16 (70m 37b 2x4 0x6) SR: 43.24;

13.2;2;Finn to Smith, 2 runs pitched up on the pads, clipped firmly behind square with a flick of the wrists, Trott does well running round from fine leg to prevent a boundary;

12.6;1lb;Anderson to Smith, 1 leg bye pushed towards leg stump, slightly short and the ball rolls square off the pad as Smith attempts a glance;

12.4;?;Anderson to Smith, no run touch shorter, on middle and leg, looks to turn it off the body but misses out;
12.3;?;Anderson to Smith, no run length ball in the channel, no movement for Anderson on this occasion and Smith lets it through;

10.6;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run angled in and going straight on this time, hits Rogers above the knee, this is a thorough examination;
10.5;4;Anderson to Rogers, FOUR runs that's a beauty, Rogers trying to whip it to leg and getting a thick edge wide of the diving Root at third slip, it was very full and shaping late back towards off stump - little bit of luck for the batsman but openers are entitled to that;
10.4;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run gets across and chops defensively into the off side;
10.3;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run pitched up in the channel, lets this one go;
10.2;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run oof, that's beaten everything, another seductive inswinger then holds its line but not before Rogers decided to try and drop his bat on it, the ball searing through to Prior;
10.1;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run length ball, pushed in with the arm before straightening in the channel outside off, Rogers leaves;

9.1;?;Finn to Smith, no run another jaffa, like Finn's first delivery to Clarke, hitting the seam and jagging past the outside edge as Smith thrust his bat into his front pad - England all go up due to the sound but Aleem Dar is unmoved, rightly so;
8.6;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run angled in and turned off the pads towards midwicket;
8.5;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run length ball, played with an angled bat, maybe seams back a touch and take an under-edge down on to the pitch;

6.2;W;Anderson to Clarke, OUT oh, bowled him, that's a peach of a delivery from Anderson! Unplayable covers it but that ball deserves a few more words in homage. It was on a length, curving in to pitch on off stump and then shape back past Clarke's outside edge as he groped forward, the ball kissing the top of off and gently dislodging the bails. Too good for Australia's best;Michael Clarke b Anderson 0 (12m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
6.1;1;Anderson to Rogers, 1 run angled across, touch full and steered in front of point for a single;

4.5;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run that's a fairly poor short delivery, angled down the leg side;

3.4;W;Finn to Cowan, OUT and another! Fast-forward cricket. What a day we are having. Another awful top-order shot, Cowan chases a very wide, full delivery and edges a low catch to Swann at second slip. Not a shot he'll want to frame.;Ed Cowan c Swann b Finn 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
3.3;W;Finn to Watson, OUT gone! Finn hits back...full outside off, drawing Watson into the drive, and a thick outside flies to third slip where Root, new in that position, holds on well;Shane Watson c Root b Finn 13 (15m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 92.85;
3.2;?;Finn to Watson, no run decent yorker, well dug out;
3.1;4;Finn to Watson, FOUR runs super timing from Watson, punches this from off stump wide of mid-on with a straight bat...coming out of the middle so far;
2.6;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run huge appeal for lbw! Will they review? Nope, they decide against it. Pitched outside leg, perhaps. Rogers did shuffle across, it wasn't a bad shout;
2.5;4;Anderson to Rogers, FOUR runs this drive is played with more power, leans into the shot, and it beats Pietersen over a quick boundary;
2.4;2;Anderson to Rogers, 2 runs he's off the mark with a neat push through the off side;
2.3;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run makes him play, starts on off stump and begins to shape away, driven to cover;

 Innings Start
So, Australia will chase 311 for victory. They'll have to break the venue record - the highest successful chase at Trent Bridge is 284, as you can see from this list.
149.5;W;Siddle to Anderson, OUT rapid end to the innings now as Anderson simply clips a catch to short midwicket from a ball that stays a touch low, and Hughes makes no mistake. Siddle ends up with three for the innings and eight for the match;James Anderson c Hughes b Siddle 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
149.4;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run fullish on the stumps and it's pushed away to leg;
149.3;W;Siddle to Swann, OUT this time the edge to slip has been snapped up! Siddle goes just a fraction short of a length and Swann's attempted punch through the off side flies off the edge between Watson at first and Clarke at second, this time both go for it instead of neither, and Clarke nabs it in front of Watson;Graeme Swann c Clarke b Siddle 9 (40m 28b 1x4 0x6) SR: 32.14;

149.1;1;Siddle to Finn, 1 run short of a length and it's clipped away through leg;
148.6;2;Starc to Swann, 2 runs hmm, this time Swann does get bat on ball and his attempted loft through leg lobs up towards mid off, but safely out of the reach of a fieldsman;
148.5;?;Starc to Swann, no run yet another lbw shout and yet another refusal from Dharmasena;
148.4;?;Starc to Swann, no run another lbw appeal, another not out. This one was straighter, but the angle from around the wicket still makes it hard to see that doing anything but sliding down;
148.3;?;Starc to Swann, no run curving down the leg side now and Starc appeals, but there's no chance of that being given lbw;
148.2;?;Starc to Swann, no run angling it towards off stump and it's defended solidly;

146.4;?;Starc to Swann, no run defended this time by Swann;
146.3;1;Starc to Finn, 1 run thickish inside edge away to the leg side to get off the mark;
146.2;W;Starc to Bell, OUT full ball just outside off, Bell plays forward and nicks it behind a feather edge and up goes the finger. Bell's fabulous effort comes to an end. He went forward a foot outside off to a ball that straightened enough to take the edge that carried low through to Haddin. The change and around the wicket angle works;Ian Bell c ?Haddin b Starc 109 (385m 267b 15x4 0x6) SR: 40.82;
146.1;?;Starc to Bell, no run length ball on off stump, Bell forward to block into the covers;

145.4;?;Siddle to Swann, no run goes to forces this off the back foot just outside off, it doesn't come on at all and Swann gets an inside edge up the wicket;

144.6;?;Pattinson to Bell, no run back on a length just outside off stump, played forward and blocked back to the bowler;

140.5;W;Pattinson to Broad, OUT forces off the back foot, edged and caught behind and Australia cling on to a chance with Haddin taking it diving to his left, a comfortable catch and this time Broad walks off! Trying to force away on the off side, the delivery slanted across Broad who probably should have been playing a little straighter and got a thick outside edge, straightforward take for Haddin;Stuart Broad c ?Haddin b Pattinson 65 (206m 148b 7x4 0x6) SR: 43.91;
140.4;?;Pattinson to Broad, no run finds the squarer of the two off side catchers with a back foot push;

118.1;?;Siddle to Bell, no run blocked forward on off stump;
117.6;?;Agar to Broad, no run short and wide, Broad nicks it to slip taken by Clarke. Is it? No, Broad stands there and the umpires do not give it out.

110.6;?;Watson to Broad, no run pushed across very wide this time and Broad can barely reach it, though he tried;

109.1;?;Starc to Bell, no run round the wicket, pitched up and blocked;
108.6;?;Watson to Broad, no run straighter, clipped off the pads to the man at midwicket - somehow, that's another maiden to Watson, his ninth;
108.5;?;Watson to Broad, no run edged but short of slip, this time a more regulation fend away from the body, the ball still doesn't get up and Broad survives;
108.4;?;Watson to Broad, no run maybe it was a set up, as this is a better length, nibbles back a touch, Broad swings hard and straight and gets a low inside edge, which Haddin does well to stop as it whirs towards the helmet behind him;

107.1;?;Agar to Broad, no run floated up outside off, defended on the front foot;
106.6;?;Watson to Bell, no run tailing in and not so far from pinning Bell in front again, little tickle of bat turns it to midwicket;
106.5;?;Watson to Bell, no run pitched up and shaping away as Bell shoulders arms;
106.4;1;Watson to Broad, 1 run length ball on the stumps, manages to work it between mid-on and midwicket with a sort of aggressive broomhandling;

102.3;?;Siddle to Bell, no run good length, homing in on off stump, full face of the bat shown in defence;

100.6;4;Siddle to Broad, 4 runs an all-run four, you don't see those too often these day, Broad played back, sliced a square drive that trickled down towards third man after someone got a hand on it, the batsmen pump the arms and legs to get back for the fourth;

100.3;?;Siddle to Broad, no run good line, induces an uncertain waft outside off, Broad's feet planted in the crease, though the ball doesn't carry through to Haddin - it bobbles and bounces and gives him another awkward moment, been a tough game for the keeper, too;

99.3;1;Agar to Broad, 1 run goes back this time and loops the ball into the air through midwicket, no one there though;
99.2;?;Agar to Broad, no run Broad thrusts out his front pad and refuses to play a shot, interesting tactic with the ball spinning back in but Dar shakes his head, would have been guessing;
99.1;1;Agar to Bell, 1 run round the wicket, tossed up outside off, tickled through the covers for a single;
98.6;?;Pattinson to Broad, no run again he tries for the short one, again Broad leaves it easily;
98.5;?;Pattinson to Broad, no run another one banged in short, but too wide of off, which means Broad can just let it sail through;
98.4;?;Pattinson to Broad, no run bouncer now, Broad sways out of the way of it;
98.3;?;Pattinson to Broad, no run good piece of fielding from Agar at backward point here, Broad jammed down on a near-yorker outside off and it flew away only to be sharply stopped by Agar. He can do no wrong;

96.6;?;Pattinson to Bell, no run solid in defence this time;
96.5;2;Pattinson to Bell, 2 runs Bell cuts and Cowan misfields at point. It really has been a tough old time for Cowan in the field in this match.;
96.4;2;Pattinson to Bell, 2 runs this time Bell finds a couple of runs through midwicket and that's his half-century, well played to get there, because it hasn't been easy, and every run he puts England further in front is vital;

96.2;1;Pattinson to Broad, 1 run good line on off stump, Broad gets a thick inside edge away through square leg for a single;

93.1;?;Agar to Bell, no run defended away to the off side;
92.6;W;Siddle to Prior, OUT Siddle has done it! Prior's promising innings ends with a pull to midwicket. Siddle has banged it in short and whether the ball has sat up a bit more than he expected, I'm not sure, but he's really mistimed it and Ed Cowan at midwicket makes no mistake;Matt Prior c Cowan b Siddle 31 (57m 42b 6x4 0x6) SR: 73.8;
92.5;?;Siddle to Prior, no run pushed away towards point, can't find the gap;
92.4;?;Siddle to Prior, no run again Prior meets the ball with a rock solid defence. He's looking good, and could really set up a challenging target for Australia;
92.3;?;Siddle to Prior, no run just outside off stump, no swing from Siddle, Prior defends;
92.2;2;Siddle to Prior, 2 runs clipped off his pads now and they hare through for two runs, Starc's throw from the deep is not good enough to put Prior in danger at the keeper's end;
92.1;4;Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs lovely timing from Prior here, Siddle goes fullish on the stumps and the straight drive is just a punch really, but timed so well that it races away to the boundary;
91.6;?;Agar to Bell, no run Bell will be frustrated there, he's got a low full toss but has only managed to drive it on the bounce to the man at mid-on;
91.5;?;Agar to Bell, no run not such a good ball there, it drifts down leg, and Bell tries for the sweep but can't make contact;

91.3;?;Agar to Bell, no run down leg a bit further now and Bell can't get bat on ball;
91.2;?;Agar to Bell, no run good line and Bell gets an inside edge on to his pad;
91.1;?;Agar to Bell, no run big shout for lbw here but Aleem Dar is not interested. Agar was drifting that one in from around the wicket, it looked to be going on with the arm and probably down leg;
90.6;?;Siddle to Prior, no run slower now from Siddle, and swinging in a touch, driven to mid-off;
90.5;?;Siddle to Prior, no run defended away safely;
90.4;4;Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs almost a wicket! Siddle gave Prior some width and he threw everything at that cut, Cowan at point has thrown his hands up above his head and just failed to get them to the ball. Not sure if he could have reached that, probably not, but a taller man certainly might have;
90.3;?;Siddle to Prior, no run Prior looks rock solid here, he defends again;
90.2;?;Siddle to Prior, no run no swing for Siddle here as he probes the off stump line, Prior has no trouble defending;

 Innings Start
2.50pm Right folks, I'm going to sign off from here shortly. We'll have loads more analysis and reaction on the site over the next few hours. Thanks to you all for following the Test with us, it has been truly memorable occasion. And we do it all again from Thursday! For now, from Gnasher, Alex, Alan and Brydon it's goodbye.
2.45pm Some emotion in those chats. The Ashes means so much. It appears we are in for another epic. Here are a few more of your comments:
Pawan: "You can't really say that England "managed" DRS the best. They just used it what it was for (eliminating howlers) and Australia just failed to do that but England really did deserve to win. They were on top through the whole test bar few key moments but one the biggest moment of the match."
Picky Ronting: "forget DRS, the team that won was the one that managed a century and two michelles"
Deepak: "@Daniel: Some relatively ordinary batting yesterday and some top class bowling by Anderson through the match determined the outcome of this match. DRS played a role but Australia would be wise to focus on things like batting properly."
Mark Francome: "Great showing by Australia to even get close. Not sure it's really a controversial end to the match, the noise as the ball went by the edge is very clear and there's a Hot Spot mark. Maybe Clarke will save some of his reviews now for when they really count."
Tom: "Flummoxed as to how anyone can say that that constituted conclusive evidence."
RossMac: "The team that played better won. And while Cook managed the use of DRS better than Clarke, I believe it's usage should be expanded to all dismissals...even to check if it was a "no-ball". It's a 30 hour game, they have the time to use it in Tests and get the decisions right. This match has mostly highlighted it's inadequacies and/or inconsistencies."
2.35pm Presentation time: Michael Clarke "The boys can hold their heads high. It was a wonderful game. Credit to England, they fought really hard. The two best performers were Ian Bell and James Anderson so they deserved the win. Everybody, the players and the fans, have enjoyed this game. We get another crack in four days."
Asked about DRS: "I'm not happy with my use, as I haven't got many right. England have used it better than I have."
Alastair Cook "I said I would be the only England captain not to go bald, but days like today won't help! Without a doubt you are in control out there. Australia fought incredible hard, but we just hung in there. Jimmy was outstanding. He always wants one more over; 13 was quite a lot. He's a world-class bowler and sometimes you just use him. It happened to be Jimmy's day and Jimmy's game. He said the cramp was my fault.
On Bell: "Under that pressure it was a real innings of character, determination and skill. Australia bowled very well. The way the whole order batted, credit to all the guys. You've seen in this game what a good side Australia are."
Man of the Match is James Anderson "It had the nerves going a bit. The ground has been good to me over the years. It generally swings whether conventional or reverse, which ever way is a bonus. Cooky's catch [off Siddle] made up for the one he dropped before. If I'm bowling 13 overs spells it will be difficult! But I love playing cricket. The Ashes is right up there."
2.30pm So many wonderful performances in this match: Siddle, Agar, Bell, Haddin but the decisive one was Anderson. He is a herculean fast bowler. Keith Bennett echos the views of millions: "Oh, I don't know how I'll be able to take four more tests of this, let alone another nine!"
Jason: "Agree that the best team won, but isn't it a shame that comments like 'the team that managed DRS best won'. Shouldn't it be 'the team that played the best cricket won'?" I agree Jason, but DRS is now part of the game.
Daniel: "It's a sad day when the tactical usage of a flawed DRS determines the outcome of a test match. I don't think I am being too harsh in saying so either"
Matt Prior spoke a moment ago: "Huge amount of relief, to be honest with you. At lunchtime, 20 runs to go, you don't know. You always know you're one ball away, one wicket away."
2.20pm Blimey folks. I still can't quite my head around all that. Apologies if that wicket is a little garbled. The basic details are: Haddin caught behind. Anderson has 10 wickets in the match and England win by 14 runs. Anderson's match figures the best for England in an Ashes Test since Andrew Caddick and Sydney in 2003. Spare a though for Brad Haddin and James Pattinson. An epic, wonderful, gusty, effort to get them so close to history. Not quite two runs, but so, so close. One though, too. England have reviews left.
Chris Howard: "Extraordinary game! DRS ends on a good note, doing what it's meant to do. And the team that won was the one that managed DRS usage the best."
Karl Correa: "Let's get this straight. It was clearly out the nick and the hot spot. Straightforward decision. The commentators on are talking about controversy. Third umpire got it right. That's that England go up 1-0."
110.5;W;Anderson to Haddin, OUT ENGLAND HAVE WON! Amazing scenes. There was only really half an appeal as Haddin drives and Prior takes the catch low. There was a review but it didn't look like England believed. Cook decided to gamble and after rocking and rolling the pictures, and after asking for multiple replays, Marias Erasmus, a man at the centre of so much this game, told Aleem Dar there was definite evidence to overrule. Here's a replay of what happened: Haddin drives, it goes past the inside edge. There is a noise. Is there a mark? There is something on the inside edge? Oh boy, what a moment. The third umpire wants to hear the sound too. There is a noise. I can't believe this. IT'S OUT;Brad Haddin c ?Prior b Anderson 71 (215m 147b 9x4 0x6) SR: 48.29;

105.4;?;Swann to Haddin, no run defended this time;
105.3;4;Swann to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin goes the big slog sweep and could this be caught? Yes, no! Finn at deep square leg has dropped it, but that's a very tough one, he's running around to his left and diving as he tries for the catch. And it runs away to the boundary through his fingers!;
105.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin leans outside off and flicks it back towards the bowler;
105.1;2;Swann to Haddin, 2 runs tossed up outside off, and Haddin goes the big sweep, this runs away to deep midwicket and they pick up two more;
104.6;?;Broad to Pattinson, no run driven to cover now;
104.5;?;Broad to Pattinson, no run beaten! Broad goes for the slower off-cutter, good to see him mix it up, and it beats Pattinson outside off. It's actually beaten him by quite a bit - it's turned too much!;

101.2;?;Swann to Pattinson, no run accurate stuff from Swann, but Pattinson defends solidly;

97.3;4;Swann to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin goes for the slog sweep and Steven Finn at deep square leg has totally lost this ball! It bounced safely well short of him, but Finn couldn't see where he had to run to cut off the boundary, and those are four valuable runs;
97.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run he tries to flick through leg but the man at short midwicket collects;
97.1;1;Swann to Pattinson, 1 run tossed up from around the wicket and Pattinson drives to mid-off, who is deep and allows a single;
96.6;1;Anderson to Pattinson, 1 run nicely whipped through the leg side to the sweeper on the boundary, but the single means Pattinson is on strike to Swann;

94.3;?;Anderson to Pattinson, no run defended away to the off side;
94.2;W;Anderson to Siddle, OUT Cook takes this catch! Siddle is gone! Anderson has struck again and England are one wicket from victory! This was fuller and wide of off, swinging away just a touch, and Siddle went for the big drive. His edge flew away to the right of Cook at first slip and that's a super catch, he has to hurl his hands out quickly and that more than makes up for his missed chance in Anderson's last over;Peter Siddle c Cook b Anderson 11 (25m 22b 2x4 0x6) SR: 50;
94.1;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run stays low again on off stump, Siddle defends;
93.6;?;Swann to Haddin, no run oh, Swann is proving a handful here! This one stays low and does it take the edge or just pad? Hmm, hard to tell there, but it's lobbed up forward of slip;
93.5;?;Swann to Haddin, no run pushed back to the bowler;
93.4;4b;Swann to Haddin, 4 byes oh, that has very nearly bowled Haddin! So, so close! It has turned in from just outside off, Haddin wound up for a big drive but the turn beat his inside edge, and it's bounced just over leg stump. To add insult to injury, it's beaten Prior and run away for four byes;
93.3;?;Swann to Haddin, no run almost yorker length again, Haddin defends;
93.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run flighted again and fullish, Haddin jams it out and back towards the bowler;
93.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run tossed up on off, Haddin defends;
92.6;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run probing outside off again, and Siddle pushes to point;
92.5;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run pushed away to the leg side;
92.4;1;Anderson to Siddle, 1 run < b="">! Cook has put Siddle down at first slip! A thick edge from Siddle and this has flown quickly to the left of Cook at first slip, it was really catchable. Should have taken that, despite the fact it was coming at a decent clip. The deflection off his hands also allows them to get through for a run<>;
92.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run a little movement away from Anderson, lovely bowling again, and this beats the outside edge;
92.2;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run Anderson attacks the off-stump line, and Siddle defends;

91.1;1;Swann to Siddle, 1 run lovely use of the feet straight away from Siddle, he dances down the pitch and clips the ball past short midwicket, though didn't time it;
90.6;1;Anderson to Siddle, 1 run accurate again from Anderson - if Siddle missed that would have hit middle - but Siddle is good enough to flick it through midwicket;
90.5;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run attacking the stumps now and Siddle pushes to mid-on, can't find a run;
90.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run beaten outside off! This one stays low though, and even if Siddle had edged it, it would have bounced safely short of Prior;
90.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run tries the yorker now and Siddle keeps it out;
90.2;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run quick running now as Haddin nudges to cover and takes off for a sharp, but safe, single;
90.1;2;Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs Haddin is looking to pick up quick runs here, he drives hard and in the air, again this is not where he intended but it sails safely over extra cover and the sweeper prevents a boundary;
89.6;4;Broad to Siddle, FOUR runs another boundary! Broad strays onto the pads and Siddle just works it through the midwicket gap, nice timing - only in the air briefly and a lovely shot;
89.5;4;Broad to Siddle, FOUR runs Siddle throws caution to the wind here, flashes outside off with a square drive in the air but it flies safely through the gap at point and he picks up a boundary;
89.4;?;Broad to Siddle, no run angled in towards off, and Siddle defends again;

88.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run another edge, though this is a thick one that runs away safely to gully;
88.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run a little bit of outswing for Anderson and Siddle pushes it away to cover;
88.2;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run well wide of off, and Siddle leaves it alone;
88.1;W;Anderson to Starc, OUT another one caught at slip! Lovely bowling from Anderson as this one pitches on leg and nips away sharply off the seam, Starc looks to defend and edges to Cook.;Mitchell Starc c Cook b Anderson 1 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
87.6;?;Broad to Haddin, no run probing on off stump and Haddin defends;
87.5;?;Broad to Haddin, no run finds the straight drive now, but mid-off does well to get across and save a run;

87.3;?;Broad to Haddin, no run oh, Haddin gets a thick inside edge on this and it skews back into his pad, could easily have ricocheted back onto the stumps;
87.2;1;Broad to Starc, 1 run Starc is off the marc, or should that be mark, with a quick single to midwicket;

86.3;W;Anderson to Agar, OUT edged! Caught! Breakthrough! Anderson finds Agar's edge from round the wicket, just pushing away from his body and it flies quickly to Cook who is the line slip fielder and he holds on to a sharp chance.;Ashton Agar c Cook b Anderson 14 (124m 71b 2x4 0x6) SR: 19.71;
86.2;?;Anderson to Agar, no run he creamed that, a lovely flowing drive outside off but it goes straight to cover;
