Yes, Umesh it will be. Shaun Marsh on strike. Fasten your seat belts
6:30pm Players are making their way out. Will MS try something different and hand the new ball to Umesh? Will he hold Sran back as the first change bowler. We'll find out very soon.
Our stats man Bharath Seervi with another interesting nugget: Teams have posted 265+ eight times against Australia at 'The G'. The hosts have chased them down successfully on five occasions.
6:10pm Interesting thoughts from Wasim Akram. He reckons 295 at the MCG is worth more than it actually is, considering the dimensions of the ground. Will the Indian bowlers prove him right? The series is on the line. MS Dhoni will need a big performance from Ishant and Umesh, especially in Ashwin's absence.
5:51pm: India finish with 295 for 6. It doesn't look enough, again. Their bowlers have another tough task ahead, with their batsmen not connecting with enough blows in the death.
Australia's bowlers, however, impressed, and were ably backed up by their fielders. Hastings pounded the deck and claimed his career-best ODI figures. Richardson too hurried batsmen and they tied down Dhawan. The opener scratched his way to a fifty, Rahane's was more fluent, Kohli struck 117, and Dhoni produced a cameo. But India could not cross 300. The visitors managed only 46 in the last five overs for three wickets.
Shashank will call the chase. Ciao
Kohli: I love to bat with Rahane. MS was charged up today. He wanted to smack a few today. On a slowish wicket, he has done a tremendous job. The guys are excited to make it 2-1. It is not an easier track to bat on.
Dav: "Australian allrounders bowling 31 overs 179 runs 5 wickets Australian bowlers (Kane and Boland) 19 overs 111 runs 1 wicket So the allrounders have done very well here too."
Suraj: "Really ? That's your summary of the match? Can't score more than 9-10 an over with 5 fielders outside!!! --- Considering the form of India's bowlers, this total does not look enough. India's fielding has been sloppy too
Aditya: "India about 30 runs short of what they needed to have a good chance of winning. Dhoni's innings was very crucial though . He was the difference between a score of 280 - 285 and a score of 295. "
rajkamal: "Hows the pitch behaving. Does it has anything for bowler?" - No lateral movement, but a few balls are sticking in the pitch.

Presentation:
Steven Smith: We did well to keep them down to 295. They bowled well in the middle, lost a few wickets in clumps before the Maxwell show. It was great to see him bat the way he did today. He scores so fast playing normal cricket shots, he's got all the shots. He plays so beautifully when he hits the ball in the right areas. Hopefully, he'll keep doing that. If I have my time over again, I may have batted first today. I didn't anticipate it to get so dry in the end. There's still room for improvement though.
Glenn Maxwell is the Player of the Match for his exhilarating 96: I wanted to shake off the tag of being called 'The Big Show'. So yes, this is special. They got a good score, to chase that down with James Faulkner in the end is unbelievable. I feel like I've been making big strides over the last few months. The way I'm hitting the ball and approaching the game is different to what I've been doing over the last few years. It's unfortunately not much of a break until Canberra, so maybe we'll have a small celebration tonight.
MS Dhoni: It's tough to take. We didn't field well tonight. There were at least three boundaries we should have easily stopped. The batsmen are working hard, but we're always talking about 10-15 extra runs. This was a slightly different wicket, but there was not much the batsmen could have done. 295 was a good total. Sran didn't have a good day, so it became difficult for himself, and I couldn't rotate the bowlers. Rishi and Gurkeerat bowled well, so we somewhat covered up for Ashwin's absence. There is some encouragement, it is tough when you lose games but you have to realise the bowling attack is largely inexperienced. It's good to see Ishant bowl well in the middle, but when there's a bit of pressure, the fast bowlers leak runs.
Two Rohit tons, and now a Kohli century in vain. A better performance from the bowlers and the fielders, but was still not enough to stop the Australians. Could have been a lot closer, but Maxwell was the difference between the sides on the night. A terrific exhibition of uninhibited hitting took the game away from India at a time when the game was on a knife's edge. Ishant bowled well, but Umesh and Sran were far too inconsistent. Even Jadeja's effort, which would have been enough on most nights, was scant consolation for Dhoni's men on the night.
Chandra: "If there was one pitch in which Jadeja and Ashwin should have played together is this one and India make the mistake of dropping Ashwin for this match. "
Mark: "I think this series has shown a real difference in the cricket culture between India and Australia. Australia see more than just the middle of the pitch: they see every square metre of the ground, which leads to the philosophy that pressure has to be put on the field and from the field."
Raees Ul Haq: "All three Asian Cricket giants are having a hard time in Australia and New Zealand this summer . First it was Sri Lanka, Now India and Pakistan has a chance to win the T20 series even though they got thrashed today ."
Didn't someone say the other night that it's written in Faulkner's contract to hit the winning runs? He's done it again
48.5;1;Yadav to Faulkner, 1 run dabbed wide of point for an easy run as Australia take an unassailable lead in the five-match series;
48.4;W;Yadav to Maxwell, OUT looks for the glory hit, the length ball gets a little big on him, can't get any power behind that attempted slap over cover, Dhawan, running back from mid-off, keeps his eye on the ball and takes it well. It was swirling in the air but he kept his composure. Has come a little too late for India. Maxwell walks off to a huge round of applause. What a knock!;Glenn Maxwell c S Dhawan b Yadav 96 (104m 83b 8x4 3x6) SR: 115.66;
48.3;4;Yadav to Maxwell, FOUR runs short, wide and he cracks that up and over backward point, huge gap there, deep cover fielder did a 200-metre sprint but couldn't get anywhere near the ball. Maxi one hit away from a century;

46.5;?;Sharma to Faulkner, no run crunched but straight to Rohit at cover this time;
46.4;2;Sharma to Faulkner, 2 runs steps out and eases it into the gap at square third man, back easily for the second run. Just backed away, made room and chopped it nicely;

46.2;1;Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run worked across the line towards square leg;

44.4;?;Sharma to Maxwell, no run slower one again on middle and leg, turned to Umesh at square leg, Maxwell was miles outside the crease, not sure why Umesh didn't throw. There was no one backing up alright, but he should have taken the chance and fired the throw;
44.3;?;Sharma to Maxwell, no run backs away to slap that over cover, no room to work with, beaten. Excellent change of pace from Ishant, it was the leg-cutter;

42.4;6;Yadav to Maxwell, SIX runs clears the front leg and tonks one over long-off. Cross-court fore hand, anybody? He sure can try that at the Rod Laver Arena tomorrow.;

39.4;6;Barinder Sran to Maxwell, SIX runs how much power does he generate! Backs away once again, the short ball was coming in, but backed himself to slap that over the infield and managed to get it all the way over the boundary. So what if the square boundaries are huge? He can still muscle them;
39.4;1w;Barinder Sran to Maxwell, 1 wide slower delivery down leg, Maxwell avoids it at the last moment, right call in the end;
39.3;?;Barinder Sran to Maxwell, no run appeal for caught behind. Maxwell backed away to go over point, the swing seemed to have missed the outside edge, or did it? Faint deviation on snicko;

39.1;4;Barinder Sran to Maxwell, FOUR runs short ball on off, he clears the front leg and slaps that over cover, couple of bounces into the boundary. Sitting up nicely because there was no pace on it. He will feast on those all day;

38.5;?;Sharma to Maxwell, no run gets an inside edge as he prods outside the line, the point fielder Jadeja comes running in quickly to cut that off;

38.1;W;Sharma to Wade, OUT short ball angling away, Wade looks to fetch the pull from outside off, only manages to top edge the pull, Dhawan comes running in from mid-on, settles underneath it and completes a simple catch.

35.1;W;Barinder Sran to Maxwell, 2 runs, OUT steps out and crunches that wide of mid-off, Umesh gives it chase, turns around and fires a throw towards Dhoni's end. Mitch Marsh was strolling back casually as the stumps are broken down by the Indian captain, who didn't give any hint of rushing in to take the throw at all. Within the bat of an eye lid, the next thing Mitch Marsh knew was the stumps were broken and he was a couple of inches short. How good has Dhoni been with the gloves today?;Mitchell Marsh run out (Yadav/?Dhoni) 17 (24m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 121.42;
34.6;2;Yadav to Marsh, 2 runs shows the full face of the bat and plays it down to Ishant, who makes a mess of that at mid-on, what was meant to be a dot ball is two instead. He took his eyes off the ball. Very, very poor. Kohli is livid and he has every right to be.;
34.5;?;Yadav to Marsh, no run appeal for lbw as the ball tails back in to hit him on leg. Mitch Marsh was rushed into that attempted flick, umpire reckons it was sliding down. Good call;

32.5;4;Yadav to Marsh, FOUR runs that's what annoys Dhoni the most about Umesh. Short and angling down leg, he helps it on its way into the fine leg boundary. Long hop that deserved to be put away;

32.3;?;Yadav to Marsh, no run closer to the stumps this time, length ball, played back to the bowler;
32.2;1;Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run forced off the back foot to deep point;

31.6;1;Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run angled into middle and leg, tucked to fine leg;
31.5;1lb;Sharma to Marsh, 1 leg bye extra bounce this time, hits him high on the right thigh, and they take a leg-bye. A direct hit from Jadeja at the bowler's end would have been interesting;
31.4;?;Sharma to Marsh, no run gets half-forward and bunts it to point;
31.3;1;Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run plays that down to Sran at third man, quickly off the blocks on that occasion;
31.2;?;Sharma to Maxwell, no run stands tall and punches it to mid-off;
31.1;4;Sharma to Maxwell, FOUR runs improvisation at its best. Short ball on middle, Maxwell arches back and directs it over Dhoni's head. You can't seat a fielder for that stroke;
30.6;4;Barinder Sran to Marsh, FOUR runs beautifully struck down the ground. Poor ball and that has been easily hit back past the mid-on fielder. Lovely timing. Straight bat down to generate the power and timing;
30.5;1;Barinder Sran to Maxwell, 1 run bunts it down to third man, sensible stuff;
30.4;4;Barinder Sran to Maxwell, FOUR runs good clean strike down the ground. Nice juicy half volley on off, Marsh shows the full face of the bat and lofts him nice and clean, one bounce into the long-on boundary;

30.2;?;Barinder Sran to Marsh, no run gets back into the crease and bunts it to the off side, loud call of no as soon as he hit it;
30.1;1;Barinder Sran to Maxwell, 1 run length ball on off, punched to deep cover;
29.6;W;Sharma to Marsh, OUT huge roar from Ishant, and that tells you how much it means to him! Coming back to the delivery, it was a length ball that was angling across, good seam position, the ball held its line, Marsh nibbled at that one without any conviction, got a thin edge, straightforward catch for MS Dhoni. India back into this big time;Shaun Marsh c ?Dhoni b Sharma 62 (116m 73b 6x4 0x6) SR: 84.93;
29.5;1;Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run short and wide outside off, punched to deep point;

28.2;?;Jadeja to Maxwell, no run played to midwicket, this one was pushed through quicker on middle again;
28.1;4;Jadeja to Maxwell, FOUR runs doesn't take long for him to unfurl the reverse sweep. Hit fiercely over point. Quick change of grip and boom!;

27.4;1;Sharma to Maxwell, 1 run chops it behind point for an easy single;
27.3;2;Sharma to Maxwell, 2 runs floats it full on middle and off, doesn't get enough timing but there's still enough to squeeze that past midwicket;

26.2;?;Jadeja to Maxwell, no run gets forward and defends;
26.1;W;Jadeja to Bailey, OUT beautifully bowled. Ball drifts back in, rips off the surface, turns square, ball zips past Bailey's half-hearted prod, his back foot was in the air as Dhoni collected it cleanly and whipped the bails off in a split second. He made it look so easy. His back foot was on the line. That will definitely even the scales once again. Dhoni knew immediately that it was out. He didn't need confirmation from the third umpire. The giant screen flashes 'OUT' and there's a roar from the Indian contingent.;George Bailey st ?Dhoni b Jadeja 23 (23m 21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 109.52;
25.6;1;Gurkeerat to Bailey, 1 run tossed up nicely, bit of spin on that one, driven inside-out to long off;

24.1;?;Jadeja to Bailey, no run pushed to cover;
23.6;?;R Dhawan to Marsh, no run outstanding stop by Jadeja at point again. Would have saved at least 10 runs on the field today, yet India find themselves well behind in the piece;
23.5;4;R Dhawan to Marsh, FOUR runs crunching cover drive. Juicy half volley this time, leans forward and crunches that into the gap. Second boundary of the over. What flow;
23.4;?;R Dhawan to Marsh, no run full on middle, turned to mid-on;
23.3;1;R Dhawan to Bailey, 1 run tucked down to fine leg, Umesh was quick to get off the blocks;
23.2;?;R Dhawan to Bailey, no run sliding down leg, tickles the pad as Dhoni stops that down leg. Stifled appeal, but more out of hope than anything else;
23.1;4;R Dhawan to Bailey, FOUR runs pierces the gap between cover and mid-off. Not all that bad a delivery but he simply put the front foot forward and hit through the line. Perfect balance, super timing;

22.1;?;Jadeja to Marsh, no run pushed to Rohit at cover;
21.6;4;R Dhawan to Bailey, FOUR runs too short, sitting up nicely for him to play the pull, Dhawan comes around, does all the hard work and then falls over, in trying to push it back in, he manages to push it into the boundary instead. Surely the crowd behind him will keep buzzing in his ears. Can be massively embarrassing;
21.5;?;R Dhawan to Bailey, no run pushed firmly to mid-off;
21.4;1;R Dhawan to Marsh, 1 run slower and fuller on off, mistimes that one back past the bowler;
21.3;?;R Dhawan to Marsh, no run beaten as he looks to ease that behind point, this one was too full, cramped for room;
21.2;2;R Dhawan to Marsh, 2 runs full outside off, squeezed into the gap behind point, back for the second to get to a fifty. Soaks in the applause of the crowd, but knows the job is just half done. 12th fifty for him;
21.1;?;R Dhawan to Marsh, no run chops one towards backward point;

18.6;1;Jadeja to Bailey, 1 run looped up on middle, front-foot drive to long-off;
18.5;W;Jadeja to Smith, OUT Jadeja strikes in his first over. India find a way past Smith. Jadeja held this one back, gets some turn as well. The outside edge is grazed and Rahane goes low at first slip to pouch it safely;Steven Smith c Rahane b Jadeja 41 (45m 45b 5x4 0x6) SR: 91.11;

15.6;?;Gurkeerat to Marsh, no run gets forward and smothers the spin;

14.4;?;R Dhawan to Smith, no run defended back down the pitch;
14.3;4;R Dhawan to Smith, FOUR runs that will definitely frustrate Dhoni, who was standing up to the stumps. Drifting down leg, tickled easily into the fine leg boundary;

14.1;?;R Dhawan to Smith, no run slower and fuller on off, played back to the bowler;
13.6;4;Gurkeerat to Marsh, FOUR runs too short this time, cut away into the gap. Cry of anguish from Dhoni this time. Got into position early and executed that cut shot to perfection;

12.3;?;R Dhawan to Marsh, no run tight line on middle, pushed to mid-on. Not much swing but he's been accurate largely;
12.2;?;R Dhawan to Marsh, no run floats it full and across Marsh, angling away, left alone;
12.1;1;R Dhawan to Smith, 1 run slow leg cutter on off, pushed to deep cover;

11.2;1;Yadav to Marsh, 1 run hurried for pace, still manages to awkwardly whip that towards square leg;

9.6;?;Yadav to Smith, no run full on off, carefully defended to the off side;
9.5;4;Yadav to Smith, FOUR runs beats the diving Jadeja at backward point. Right line, but wrong length. Too short, he unfurls his wrists superbly to beat the infield;
9.4;?;Yadav to Smith, no run peach of a delivery. Lands it a touch ahead of the length area on off, this one nips away just a touch, Smith is beaten as he looks to hit through the line;

8.5;4;Sharma to Smith, FOUR runs not all that short this time, but another pull that has split the gap on the on side. Went like a rocket. Only a batsman in the form of his life can think of playing that stroke. That Smith is in the form of his life would be an understatement;

7.2;1w;Yadav to Smith, 1 wide this one is directed down leg side, some work for the umpire;
7.1;W;Yadav to Finch, OUT a wicket finally. The outside edge has been found courtesy some late movement. Good length, drew him forward, Finch went for the drive, but the foot was nowhere to the pitch of the ball, gets a thin edge which MS accepts gleefully. The manner in which he threw the ball up after pouching that had relief written all over it. He doesn't generally get very animated after taking a catch, he was this time.;Aaron Finch c ?Dhoni b Yadav 21 (30m 23b 3x4 0x6) SR: 91.3;
6.6;?;Sharma to Marsh, no run nips away from length area outside off, left alone;
6.5;4;Sharma to Marsh, FOUR runs short ball at 137 kph, enough time for Marsh to swivel and pull that one behind square. Picked the bones out of that one. Rolled his wrists to keep it down, raced away into the boundary;
6.4;1;Sharma to Finch, 1 run back of length delivery on middle, tucked wide of square leg;
6.3;?;Sharma to Finch, no run hits the deck hard, extra bounce, hurries onto Finch's bat as he looks to defend off the back foot;
6.2;?;Sharma to Finch, no run good ball, angled in on off from wide of the crease at length, left alone;
6.1;1;Sharma to Marsh, 1 run gentle tap to mid-off as they scamper through for a quick single. Umesh was caught napping at mid-on, shouldn't have been a run;
5.6;?;Barinder Sran to Finch, no run excellent stop by Rohit, throwing himself to his right, deflected to Gurkeerat at mid-off. Saved a certain boundary;
5.5;?;Barinder Sran to Finch, no run back of length delivery on off, left alone;
5.4;?;Barinder Sran to Finch, no run straight in and straight out. Gurkeerat puts down a sitter at mid-off. It was right in the slot to drive, he hit it hard, he looked like grabbing that, popped out.;
5.3;4;Barinder Sran to Finch, FOUR runs gentle full toss this time on off, Finch says 'thank you very much'. Leans forward, goes through the line and beats cover. No chance of stopping that;
5.2;4;Barinder Sran to Finch, FOUR runs short, wide and four! Sitting up nicely for Finch to use the width and put that away into the gap behind point. Easy pickings at any level of cricket really;
5.1;3;Barinder Sran to Marsh, 3 runs gentle half volley on the pads, superbly flicked away, long boundary there at deep midwicket, they missed an opportunity to get back for the fourth. Poor bowling;

4.5;?;Sharma to Finch, no run back of length delivery on off, tapped to short cover;
4.4;?;Sharma to Finch, no run that's closer to the stumps, just a touch around off, held its line, left alone;
4.3;3;Sharma to Marsh, 3 runs sliding into the pads, easy pickings, flicked into the gap at square leg, they're back for the third quite easily, can be tough to throw on the turn here. The throw from Rohit had no power whatsoever;
4.2;1;Sharma to Finch, 1 run angled it full on middle from wide of the crease, tucked to short midwicket for a quick single;
4.2;1w;Sharma to Finch, 1 wide nips away from outside off, Finch watches it through to Dhoni. He was flirting with the wide line, umpire thinks it was wide enough;
4.1;?;Sharma to Finch, no run another half volley outside off, this one's hit hard to Rohit at cover. Finch will be kicking himself, a boundary missed.;
3.6;4;Barinder Sran to Marsh, FOUR runs wow! simply, wow. Half volley outside off, simply leans into the drive and eases it into the gap at cover. Sourav Ganguly would have been proud of that stroke. Nice high elbow as ball met bat, enough power. Once he found the gap, there was no stopping that;
3.5;?;Barinder Sran to Marsh, no run good delivery this time, more effort into the delivery, lands it ahead of good length around off, left alone;
3.4;1;Barinder Sran to Finch, 1 run gets a thick inside edge towards fine leg, lucky;
3.3;?;Barinder Sran to Finch, no run excellent stop by Jadeja at backward point, it was crunched but he threw himself to his left to stop that;

3.1;?;Barinder Sran to Finch, no run floats it full and across Finch, left alone;

2.5;?;Yadav to Marsh, no run turned towards mid-on this time, Marsh was hurried for pace on that occasion;
2.4;3;Yadav to Finch, 3 runs stands tall and punches it between the two cover fielders, good chase by Rahane but a weak throw. Once again a back of length delivery, good bat flow from Finch as he came down on it;
2.3;1;Yadav to Marsh, 1 run looks to crash it through cover, ends up slicing it behind point towards third man;
2.2;?;Yadav to Marsh, no run good delivery, length ball, closer to the stumps, Marsh hops back and plays it with soft hands;
