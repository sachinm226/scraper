11.45am That's end of the innings, and also lunch. Australia will be the happier side with this total. The wicket has started to play the tricks, but do Australia have the bowlers suited to capitalising on them? We will find out soon. I, for one, won't rule out Starc, Pattinson and Siddle on any surface. We will be back by around 12.20pm. Play resumes at 12.25pm

132.6;W;Ashwin to Lyon, OUT finally Dharmasena raises his finger. Don't think he was left with an option. Offbreak, middle and leg, swept away, gets an edge fine, and Kohli takes a superb catch to his right at backward short leg. Ashwin's best figures in first-class cricket;Nathan Lyon c Kohli b Ashwin 3 (37m 28b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10.71;
132.5;?;Ashwin to Lyon, no run defended off the back foot;
132.4;?;Ashwin to Lyon, no run beaten on the sweep, but this has hit him outside the line, but India belt out a similar appeal;
132.3;?;Ashwin to Lyon, no run carrom ball, defended off the back foot;
132.2;?;Ashwin to Lyon, no run India can't believe this. Another lbw turned down. Plumb again. Full ball, Lyon is back, is hit in front of middle, the leg stump is visible. I can't believe this is not given;
132.1;?;Ashwin to Lyon, no run starts with a yorker, Lyon digs it out;
131.6;?;Sharma to Pattinson, no run short of a length, outside leg, Pattinson doesn't get a touch on it. This could have been runs;
131.5;1b;Sharma to Lyon, 1 bye sharp movement back in from outside off, beats the in side edge, then swings more after passing the stumps. Dhoni allows a bye;
131.4;?;Sharma to Lyon, no run dug in short, the ball doesn't rise up at all, and Lyon avoids it with a half-duck;
131.3;?;Sharma to Lyon, no run short of a length, into the pads, defended easily;
131.2;?;Sharma to Lyon, no run fullish, on off, defended to mid-on;
131.1;1;Sharma to Pattinson, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, worked away for a single;
130.6;1;Jadeja to Pattinson, 1 run Dhoni is disgusted with Sharma. Pattinson pats this full ball towards Sharma at point, and takes the single. Sharma is late out of the blocks, and Dhoni lets him know through a "C'mon Ishy";
130.5;?;Jadeja to Pattinson, no run looks to drive this half-volley, but it turns and hits the inside half of the bat;
130.4;?;Jadeja to Pattinson, no run length ball, on off, defended off the front foot again;
130.3;?;Jadeja to Pattinson, no run tossed up outside off, defended to mid-off;
130.2;?;Jadeja to Pattinson, no run full, on off, defended back to him;
130.1;1;Jadeja to Lyon, 1 run full, on the pads, worked away for a single;
7.6;?;Harbhajan to Cowan, no run short, fast, punched away, but can't beat point;
7.5;4;Harbhajan to Cowan, FOUR runs full, wide outside leg, Cowan goes down, and sweeps it fine. Fine leg is way too square;
7.4;3lb;Harbhajan to Warner, 3 leg byes fired into the pads, gets three leg-byes;
7.3;?;Harbhajan to Warner, no run full again, but flat, and is defended off the front foot;
7.2;2;Harbhajan to Warner, 2 runs flighted, on the pads, worked away through midwicket;
7.1;?;Harbhajan to Warner, no run huge shout for lbw. Warner is caught back to a length ball. He looked dead but got a late inside edge. Good call from the ump, Marais Erasmus;
6.6;?;Bhuvneshwar to Cowan, no run again on the front foot to defend a delivery that is pitched short of a length;
6.5;?;Bhuvneshwar to Cowan, no run short of a length, 129ks, Cowan is well forward to defend it. They have clearly made that adjustment to low bounce;
6.4;?;Bhuvneshwar to Cowan, no run pushes forward to defend this length ball to mid-off;
6.3;?;Bhuvneshwar to Cowan, no run short of a length, on off, pushed off the back foot, to mid-off;
6.2;?;Bhuvneshwar to Cowan, no run fuller, just outside off, Cowan looks to drive, but gets an inside edge. Again some straightening of the line;
6.1;?;Bhuvneshwar to Cowan, no run short of a length, angling away, left alone;
129.6;?;Sharma to Pattinson, no run well bowled. This one comes back in against the angle, but doesn't hit the stumps even though it beats the inside edge;
129.5;?;Sharma to Pattinson, no run short of a length, angling away, beats the cut;
129.4;?;Sharma to Pattinson, no run holds its line after pitching on off, but Pattinson is equal to it and defends it back to Sharma;
129.3;?;Sharma to Pattinson, no run fuller, just outside off, defended off the back foot again;
129.2;?;Sharma to Pattinson, no run short of a length, just outside off, defended off the back foot;
129.1;?;Sharma to Pattinson, no run short of a length, angling away, beats the outside edge;
128.6;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run beaten on the sweep, but he has got himself well outside the line of off, and this time even Dhoni doesn't appeal;
128.5;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run full, on off, driven back to Jadeja;
128.4;3;Jadeja to Pattinson, 3 runs driven through the vacant cover region, and that brings them three more;
128.3;?;Jadeja to Pattinson, no run loud shout for a catch down the leg side, but this has touched nothing;
128.2;1;Jadeja to Lyon, 1 run quicker, turning away, takes the edge, but it doesn't carry to slip, and they take a single off the ricochet. First run in 32 balls, I think;
128.1;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run defended off the front foot;
127.6;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run carrom ball, not much turn on it, defended off the back foot;
127.5;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run cut away to point;
127.4;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run quicker delivery, turns away sharply, beats the outside edge;
127.3;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run defended off the front foot again;
127.2;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run defended off the front foot;
127.1;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run flat delivery, just outside off, defended off the back foot;
126.6;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run defended off the back foot;
126.5;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run keeps this out too;
126.4;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run beaten on the sweep, India appeal on cue, but this has hit him well outside the line. I tell you what, Dharmasena must have made a few mistakes, but India's appealing has been ridiculous, and crying wolf every time doesn't help you when there is no DRS;
126.3;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run tossed up, Lyon smothers the turn after moving forward;
126.2;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run flatter, on off, stays back to defend;
126.1;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run defended off the front foot;
125.6;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run stays back to defend again;
125.5;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run carrom ball, comes back in a little, defended off the back foot;
125.4;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run lower through the air, middle and leg, and it turns sharply and bounces sharply;
125.3;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run swept away to square leg;
125.2;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run short of a length, stays back to defend this to silly point;
125.1;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run tossed up outside off, left alone;
124.6;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run full and fast, defended back;
124.5;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run defended back to him;
124.4;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run India continue appealing for everything. Sometimes twice off the same ball. Looks to sweep this, and misses. Appeal for lbw is denied because it has hit him outside the line of off. But the ball lobs up to silly point, and they appeal for the catch too. Beats me how you can appeal for both because they contradict each other;
124.3;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run;
124.2;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run another huge appeal for lbw, but not given. Fullish, middle and off, straightening. Can't see much wrong with that appeal either;
124.1;?;Jadeja to Lyon, no run full, on off, defended to cover;
123.6;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run flatter, shorter, defended off the back foot;
123.5;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run stays back to defend this;
123.4;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run tossed up on off, defended back to him;
123.3;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run full, middle and leg, defended to leg;
123.2;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run stays back to defend a fullish ball;
123.1;?;Ashwin to Pattinson, no run short of a length, punched to pint where Tendulkar fields. Huge cheer as usual whenever the ball goes to him;
122.6;1;Harbhajan to Pattinson, 1 run driven down the wicket for a single;
122.5;?;Harbhajan to Pattinson, no run huge lbw appeal. Harbhajan looks disgusted. Harbhajan seems to be asking him why this is not given, and Dharmasena is not saying anything. But I tell you what, lbws don't come plumber than this. Quick delivery, flat, doesn't turn, hits his front pad in front of off, and then the back pad. Perhaps the umpire thought one of the two impacts was off the bat. The pitch mat says it might have hit him just outside the line of off, but it is not conclusive;
122.4;?;Harbhajan to Pattinson, no run defended off the front foot;
122.3;4;Harbhajan to Pattinson, FOUR runs and he bowls short and wide now. Pattinson cuts it away for four through point;
122.2;?;Harbhajan to Pattinson, no run slower through the air, draws good bounce from the pitch, but Pattinson rides it and defend well;
122.1;?;Harbhajan to Pattinson, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the back foot;
121.6;1;Jadeja to Pattinson, 1 run shortish, goes back to work into the leg side for a single;
121.5;?;Jadeja to Pattinson, no run stays back to defend a shortish delivery;
121.4;?;Jadeja to Pattinson, no run defended off the back foot;
121.3;?;Jadeja to Pattinson, no run flighted outside off, kicked away;
121.2;1;Jadeja to Lyon, 1 run fired in, appeal for a leg-before, as Lyon gets too far across. It's a pretty good shout. It's plumb actually. Hitting middle of middle. Not given by Erasmus;
121.1;1;Jadeja to Pattinson, 1 run stays low, is pretty straight, but Pattinson gets the bat down in time. Gets a single to leg;
120.6;W;Harbhajan to Siddle, OUT Bhajji finally gets a wicket in his 100th Test. Finally Sehwag takes a catch. He has worked Siddle out well. After that slow doosra, he bowls full and fast, and Siddle guides this to slip. Sehwag is awake, and Harbhajan has a wicket, who looks towards the skies in sheer relief;Peter Siddle c Sehwag b Harbhajan Singh 19 (111m 94b 2x4 0x6) SR: 20.21;
120.5;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run defended off the front foot;
120.4;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run lovely delivery. Slower through the air, the doosra, beats the outside edge big time, but it's the bounce that saves Siddle. Bhaj's first doosra in the match?;
120.3;1;Harbhajan to Pattinson, 1 run stays low as Pattinson goes back to defend, but he does well to keep it out;
120.2;?;Harbhajan to Pattinson, no run fuller, on off, Pattinson goes back in defence;
120.1;2;Harbhajan to Pattinson, 2 runs quick, into the pads, nicely worked around the corner for a couple;
119.6;?;Jadeja to Siddle, no run full and straight again, defended;
119.5;?;Jadeja to Siddle, no run full straight and fast, a dart really. Defended back to him;
119.4;?;Jadeja to Siddle, no run pushes forward to block this full ball;
119.3;?;Jadeja to Siddle, no run quick and flat, defended off the back foot;
119.2;?;Jadeja to Siddle, no run full and straight, defended off the front foot;
119.1;W;Jadeja to Clarke, OUT Clarke has finally got out. And the wicket comes - as Dhoni has been expecting for hours - through a mistake by the batsman. Clarke skips down the track, is not close to the pitch of the ball, but goes ahead with an attempt to loft it straight down the ground. The ball turns, and hits the outside half of the bat, and Clarke holes out to long-off;Michael Clarke c Kumar b Jadeja 130 (323m 246b 12x4 1x6) SR: 52.84;
118.6;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run quicker, just outside off, hits the higher part of the defensive bat;

118.3;1;Harbhajan to Siddle, 1 run full, into the pads, gives away an easy single;
118.2;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run short of a length, turns and bounces, but defended well;
118.1;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run sharp turn, but starts too wide, and Siddle can look to pad it away;
117.6;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run quicker, flatter, Clarke punches this to cover;
117.5;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run skips down the track and drives this back to Jadeja;
117.4;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run full, middle and leg, driven to mid-on;
117.3;1;Jadeja to Siddle, 1 run short again, guided past slip for a single;
117.2;?;Jadeja to Siddle, no run turn for him, the pitch is playing tricks now. From a short of a length, flat delivery, and it spins past the edge;
117.1;?;Jadeja to Siddle, no run full, middle and leg, defended back to him;
116.6;?;Harbhajan to Clarke, no run quicker, flatter, worked away off the pad, but can't beat square leg;
116.5;?;Harbhajan to Clarke, no run down the wicket again, defended to leg;
116.4;?;Harbhajan to Clarke, no run stays back for this length ball. Defends without trouble;
116.3;?;Harbhajan to Clarke, no run comes down the wicket to defend this flighted delivery to cover;
116.2;?;Harbhajan to Clarke, no run stays back for a delivery that is even fuller. Hits the outside half of the bat;
116.1;?;Harbhajan to Clarke, no run tossed up, gets a bit of dip, turns in, hits the higher part of the defensive bat;
115.6;1;Jadeja to Clarke, 1 run short this time, pushed wide of cover for one;
115.5;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run forward-defensive again;
115.4;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run quick delivery, defended;
115.3;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run ridiculous appeal. Clarke is half way down the wicket, and has been hit outside the line;
115.2;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run dropped. Sharp turn for Jadeja from a length, but Pujara doesn't hold on at silly point. This came at a catchable height. India continue to miss their chances;
115.1;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run full, middle and leg, defended to leg;
114.6;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run shorter, Siddle looks to cut, but it is not that short either, and pulls out of it at the last moment;
114.5;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run again stays back to defend a length ball;
114.4;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run stays back to defend a length ball. Not much turn on this;
114.3;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run short again, defended towards mid-on;
114.2;1;Harbhajan to Clarke, 1 run jumps out of the crease, right to the pitch of the ball, drives to deep cover, gets a single to bring up 50 runs for the partnership;
114.1;?;Harbhajan to Clarke, no run short, punched away, but finds short cover;
113.6;3;Bhuvneshwar to Clarke, 3 runs driven well, past cover, nicely done;
113.5;?;Bhuvneshwar to Clarke, no run half a shout for lbw as he gets inside the line of it, but it is headed well down the leg side;
113.4;?;Bhuvneshwar to Clarke, no run driven on the up again, but back to the bowler;

112.6;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run topspinner, outside off, beats the outside edge;
112.5;4;Harbhajan to Siddle, FOUR runs Edges and it couldn't have been taken. He draws him forward, the ball doesn't turn as much as Siddle expects, but the edge is just the right amount of healthy to elude the keeper to the right and the slip to the left;
112.4;?;Harbhajan to Siddle, no run tossed up outside off, Siddle is drawn forward, but he defends well;
112.3;1;Harbhajan to Clarke, 1 run stays back for a length ball again, and gets inside the line to guide it behind square on the leg side;
112.2;?;Harbhajan to Clarke, no run short this time, but it stays low, and Clarke has to be quick with his bat to keep it out;
112.1;?;Harbhajan to Clarke, no run good start. Slow, on a length, outside off. The turn is not sharp. Defended off the back foot;
111.6;?;Bhuvneshwar to Siddle, no run left alone outside off;
111.5;?;Bhuvneshwar to Siddle, no run fuller, middle and leg, defended to mid-on;
111.4;?;Bhuvneshwar to Siddle, no run driven this time. Siddle clearly doesn't mind the 131ks of BK. Finds point, though;

111.2;?;Bhuvneshwar to Siddle, no run fuller, Siddle stays back to defend, and gets an inside edge onto the pad;

110.4;?;Ashwin to Siddle, no run short of a length, stays back to defend to leg;
110.3;4;Ashwin to Siddle, FOUR runs short, wide, cut away. In the air all right, but wide of point. First boundary for Siddle. He has ruined his strike rate with this shot;
110.2;?;Ashwin to Siddle, no run drift and dip, Siddle pushes far in front of his body and defends;
110.1;?;Ashwin to Siddle, no run tossed up outside off, defended with an open face;
109.6;2;Sharma to Clarke, 2 runs looks to glance this fine, but he also gets a touch of the pad that takes the sting out of the shot and brings him only a couple;
109.5;1;Sharma to Siddle, 1 run pushed between short midwicket and square leg for a single;
109.4;1;Sharma to Clarke, 1 run pushed wide of mid-on for one;

109.1;?;Sharma to Clarke, no run short of a length, tailing back in, defended to leg;
108.6;?;Ashwin to Siddle, no run tossed up really high, but a bit too full. Siddle doesn't have to worry about the turn, and defends;

107.1;1;Sharma to Clarke, 1 run short, widish, gets a single to deep point;
106.6;?;Ashwin to Siddle, no run carrom ball? Quicker, flatter for sure, and draws the outside edge, but it doesn't carry to Sehwag at slip. Yes it was a carrom ball;

106.4;?;Ashwin to Clarke, no run goes back to a length ball, and defends solidly;

95.1;?;Ashwin to Siddle, no run turning into the pads, defended to leg;
94.6;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run the day ends with a characteristic appeal from Dhoni for bat before wicket. Even if there was such a dismissal in the book, it hit the bat outside the line;
94.5;4;Jadeja to Clarke, FOUR runs what a way to bring up the hundred. Emphatic. Dances down the wicket, right to the pitch of the ball, lofts it over mid-off. Arms are held aloft. Helmet comes off. The whole dressing room is on its feet;

90.1;W;Jadeja to Starc, OUT Ashwin won't get 10. Natural variation from Jadeja. Starc defends playing for turn, but this length ball goes straight on, beats the outside edge, and hits the off stump;Mitchell Starc b Jadeja 3 (14m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;

89.2;W;Ashwin to Henriques, OUT Ashwin has six out of six. Henriques out sweeping. This is a big offbreak, has beaten the bat, and seems to have hit him in front of off. Was it turning too far? I thought so, but on replays this looks closer;Moises Henriques lbw b Ashwin 68 (173m 132b 5x4 0x6) SR: 51.51;

Jake: "Interesting that the last Australian to score a century in their debut match in India is at the other end, that can only bode well for Henriques if he starts feeling nervous."
Clarke is getting a shoulder rub. Some discomfort?
Now he is having a long chat with Ishant Sharma. Not sure if it is a pleasant one. Meanwhile, the new ball has been taken
 Innings Start
10.29am India have a lead of 192. That's huge. This pitch looks like a clay court. Indian spinners will be falling over each other to have a go. Can Australia frustrate them for long enough to hang in for a draw? We will start finding out in 10 minutes
154.3;W;Siddle to Bhuvneshwar, OUT slower ball gets Siddle his first wicket. BK drives at it, is early into the shot, and has lobbed this to mid-off for an easy catch. The dressing room stands for BK too. He has helped his captain build the lead, and also managed the highest score by an Indian debutant from No. 10;Bhuvneshwar Kumar c Clarke b Siddle 38 (167m 97b 4x4 0x6) SR: 39.17;
154.2;1;Siddle to Sharma, 1 run punched to point where Maxwell, the substitute, misfields. They take the single but he would have gone had the throw hit. His bat was in the air again;

152.6;?;Siddle to Sharma, no run now Sharma drives on the up, but finds mid-off;

71.4;2;Lyon to Dhoni, 2 runs full toss, and he sweeps it fine of deep square leg for a couple. Starc saves two runs with a superb dive at the boundary;
71.3;4;Lyon to Dhoni, FOUR runs and Dhoni lofts over mid-on. Gets one close enough to his arc, and he doesn't hold back. Dhoni will do this every now and then. Will the mid-n go back now?;
71.2;1;Lyon to Kohli, 1 run a little short, Kohli rocks back to pull. This is not as short as the six he hit, and turns sharply too. He ends up dragging this to deep square leg, and in the air, but it bounces comfortably short;
71.1;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run looking to press forward early, but this is a flat delivery, and Kohli defends from the crease;
70.6;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run another nice inswinger towards off, Dhoni stays back to defend. Perhaps it's his camping on the back foot that is exciting Australia;
70.5;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run nice inswinger, towards middle and leg, Dhoni plays late, really late, which excites the Aussies, but he defends well in the end;

67.3;1;Lyon to Kohli, 1 run stays back to work this between the two short legs;
67.2;6;Lyon to Kohli, SIX runs Kohli has been tested, but he is alert to the rare loose ball. Lyon bowls a long hop, and he ricks back to pull it over midwicket. You need to capitalise on these when the scoring opportunities are few and far between;

146.3;W;Pattinson to Dhoni, OUT Dhoni is out finally. Pattinson gets five. He has bowled his heart out, and has fittingly ended a superb innings from the opposition captain. Dhoni falls on 224, eight short of the highest score by a wicketkeeper. This is a bouncer, on middle and leg, Dhoni gets inside the line to hook, but ends up gloving it through to Wade. The sparse crowd, and the full dressing room stand up in appreciation for the innings. Well played, captain;MS Dhoni c ?Wade b Pattinson 224 (365m 265b 24x4 6x6) SR: 84.52;

145.6;4b;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, 4 byes this is a jaffa. Not sure if it is a Jeff, but it unplayable. On a length, just outside off, BK plays for the turn, but this seems to have hit the edge of the rough, and gone straight on, and kicked for good measure. Four byes;
145.5;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run length, on off, holds its line, defended;
145.4;1;Lyon to Dhoni, 1 run the helicopter hit, he hasn't got all of it, but it bounces short of long-on. They take the single now;

63.1;W;Lyon to Tendulkar, OUT oh Lyon, what a beauty. That's a lovely offspinner's dismissal. They dream of these, and when you do this to Tendulkar in a Test in Chennai, oh boy what a feeling. Tossed up outside off, exactly in that rough, Tendulkar drives away from the body, and it spins sharply through the gate. Reminiscent of the way Vaughan got him.

143.5;6;Lyon to Dhoni, SIX runs Good morning, Nathan, says Mahendra. Flat six over long-on. He has hit the pants off this length ball after stepping down. The ball is swerving and swinging in the air;
143.4;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run Dhoni leaves the crease, Lyon shortens the length, Dhoni defends;
143.3;1;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run full again, BK presses forward, gets a single past short leg;
143.2;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run tossed up on off, defended to midwicket;
143.1;4;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, FOUR runs wide and full, BK pushes at it, gets a thick edge, which dies and goes past slip for four;
142.6;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run big reverse for Pattinson, headed down leg, and hits him on the pad;
142.5;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run short of a length, stays low again, and Dhoni has to squat to keep this out;
142.4;4b;Pattinson to Dhoni, 4 byes big-time wide down the leg side, and swinging further away, and despite Wade's dive, it has gone for four byes. A bit harsh on him. This should be wides;
142.3;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run huge appeal as the ball stays low and even though Dhoni is down the wicket he looks in trouble. This one was going to smash into the middle of middle, but Dhoni seems to have just about - by a hair's breadth - got outside the line;
142.2;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run driven on the up, powerfully, but straight to mid-off;
142.1;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run short of a length, on off, 135ks, punched to cover;
61.6;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run sharp turn and bounce, Kohli takes the bottom hand off, is hit on the handle of the bat, but luckily for him it dies immediately and falls well short of short leg;
61.5;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run flicks this one to short midwicket;
61.4;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run presses forward to smother the turn again;
61.3;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run Kohli pushes forward now, and defends to short leg;
61.2;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run that's a grubber. Lyon loves it, but it has hit Kohli on the shin outside off after turning in. A little straighter and he is a goner;
61.1;1;Lyon to Tendulkar, 1 run and Tendulkar sweeps immediately, to deep square leg for a single;
60.6;?;Pattinson to Kohli, no run short of a length, wide, left alone by Kohli;
60.5;1;Pattinson to Tendulkar, 1 run bouncer, slow bounce for him, Tendulkar ramps it to third man. Had this ball bounced properly, it might even have carried to third man, but with this bounce it is a safe shot;
60.4;1;Pattinson to Kohli, 1 run short of a length, just outside off, guided to third man to get to the other end;
60.3;?;Pattinson to Kohli, no run bouncer, 145ks, but a little too short, and he ducks under it;
60.2;1;Pattinson to Tendulkar, 1 run swinging in late, finally India score a run after four maidens as he flicks it to long leg;
60.1;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run short of a length, extra bounce, almost like a kick serve, but it is too wide to make Tendulkar play;
141.6;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run turning in sharply, he has played it square of short fine le,g but Dhoni doesn't want the single;
141.5;1;Lyon to Dhoni, 1 run this one dips on Dhoni, but he manages to guide it past short leg for a single off the fifth ball of the day;
141.4;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run;
141.3;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run down the wicket, defends this back to him;
141.2;4;Lyon to Dhoni, FOUR runs and he pulls out the reverse sweep to counter that strong leg-side field. Gets four through third man;
141.1;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run and Dhoni continues refusing singles. Works this past short leg but doesn't run;

140.5;1;Henriques to Dhoni, 1 run short, tucked away off the hip, takes a single off the fifth ball;

140.2;?;Henriques to Dhoni, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the back foot to cover;
140.1;?;Henriques to Dhoni, no run wide length ball, defended to cover;
59.6;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run outswinger, a bit too wide to play at it, and Kohli doesn't;

59.4;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run this is swinging in towards off, and Kohli defends it back;
59.3;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run full, swinging in this time, Kohli sees it early, flicks it, Cowan dives at square leg to keep them to their ends;
59.2;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run another nice outswinger. This time Kohli lets it be just outside off. Wade collects it on the bounce;
59.1;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run nice and full, swinging away this time if only a touch. Defended in front of off;
58.6;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run nicely driven as this is pitched up, but he can't beat short cover;
58.5;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run wide of the crease, outside off, holds its line, and Tendulkar is sounder in judging it and leaving it alone this time;
58.4;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run full, just outside off, dug out with an open face;
58.3;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run now Tendulkar strides forward and drives to mid-off;
58.2;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run this is going to cast further doubt as this swings in extravagantly from outside off. Tendulkar leaves it alone, but the main part of the extravagant swing happens only after it has passed the stumps;
58.1;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run short of a length, high, Tendulkar rides it, and defends to point;
139.6;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run tossed up, middle and off, flicked away to short midwicket;
139.5;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run stays back to defend this shortish ball;
139.4;1;Lyon to Dhoni, 1 run looks to ramp this behind the wicket, but this runs off the front of the bat to long-on;
139.3;1;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run too short from Lyon again, worked around the corner for one;
139.2;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run dips on him, middle and leg, defended to short midwicket;
139.1;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run on off, full, defended to short midwicket;
138.6;4;Henriques to Dhoni, FOUR runs had this been any lower, BK would have been out in the hospital. On a length, on off, dismissively rocketed back over the non-striker's head. Serious batting, this;
138.5;?;Henriques to Dhoni, no run short of a length, on off, defended back to the bowler;
138.4;?;Henriques to Dhoni, no run length ball, on off, flicked away to short midwicket;

57.6;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run short of a length, not too wide, pushed to cover;
57.5;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run bouncer, not too high, 134ks, Kohli ducks under it, but that takes some ducking, because it doesn't bounce high;
57.4;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run full, just outside off, driven to cover;
57.3;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run short of a length, this one moves away, but starts outside off, and is left alone;
57.2;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run swinging in towards off, Kohli defends from the crease;
57.1;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run full, swinging in, pushed to mid-on;
56.6;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run and he follows another wide delivery. Pattinson has troubled Tendulkar, but he has bowled three overs already. Damn. This is short of a lenght and wide, but Tendulkar still follows it, and is beaten. That judgement is a bit clouded;
56.5;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run superb delivery. Short of a length, outside off, Tendulkar plays for the angle, but it holds its line and beats the outside edge;
56.4;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run fuller, and Tendulkar is ready for it. Raina would have been caught deep in the crease. Tendulkar strides forward and defends to cover;
56.3;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run another short ball, 140ks, Tendulkar drops the wrists and sways away from it, but it bounces well short of Wade;
56.2;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run fuller, swinging in towards top of off, defended to cover;
56.1;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run bouncer, collected by Wade on the bounce, and it is bowled at 143ks too. A few boos from the crowd for bouncing Tendulkar;

137.5;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run stays back to defend another bouncing delivery;

137.3;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run full, outside off, defended solidly;
137.2;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run defended well off the back foot;
137.1;1;Lyon to Dhoni, 1 run reaches the double-century with a push to short third man. That helmet still stays on. That noise in the stadium will be audible at Marina Beach too. This was a risky single, but the throw at BK's end was wide;
136.6;4;Warner to Bhuvneshwar, FOUR runs long hop. BK shows he has a decent first-class lower-order bat by pulling this away for four to deep square;
136.5;?;Warner to Bhuvneshwar, no run sharp turn across his body, Wade removes the bails in a flash. He lifts the foot for a brief second, which is when Wade completes the stumping. But he has made it by half a frame;
136.4;?;Warner to Bhuvneshwar, no run flat legbreak from outside leg, defended off the back foot;
136.3;1;Warner to Dhoni, 1 run punched away to deep cover for a single;
136.2;1;Warner to Bhuvneshwar, 1 run long hop, pulled away for a single;
136.1;1;Warner to Dhoni, 1 run now he takes a single first ball, pushing this to long-off;
55.6;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone, Wade takes it on the half-volley;
55.5;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run this is swinging the other way, Kohli drives at it, beats short cover, but not extra cover;
55.4;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run slightly wider, he looks to drive, but straight to cover;
55.3;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run swinging in towards off, fuller, and Kohli presses forward and defends;
55.2;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run short of a length, on off, Kohli is right behind it;
55.1;1;Siddle to Tendulkar, 1 run short of a length, rising outside off, and he takes an easy single to third man;
54.6;?;Pattinson to Kohli, no run short of a length, tailing in towards off, Kohli is solidly behind it;
54.5;?;Pattinson to Kohli, no run full, swinging in, middle and leg, defended to short midwicket;
54.4;1;Pattinson to Tendulkar, 1 run short of a length, wide, guided to third man for a single;
54.3;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run another one that holds its line, and is closer to the pitch, but Tendulkar is spotting the shine clearly, and has left this alone;
54.2;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run gets this one to move the other way, but it starts too wide, 140ks, and is left alone;
54.1;1;Pattinson to Kohli, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, takes the single to fine leg;
135.6;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run defended off the back foot, and the crowd cheers that the next ball will be faced by Dhoni;
135.5;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run tossed up on off, defended solidly off the front foot;
135.4;1;Lyon to Dhoni, 1 run short again, dabbed to short third man for a single;
135.3;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run Dhoni again wanted to come down the track, but stayed back. Then he tried to late-cut it, but decided a little late and was beaten;
135.2;2;Lyon to Dhoni, 2 runs short, long hop, pulled wide of deep square leg for a couple;
135.1;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run looks to charge down, then stays cool and defends;
134.6;4;Warner to Bhuvneshwar, FOUR runs BK lets the captain know he too can bat. Looks to cut, gets a thick edge past short third man. Four for him. Now he has scored 8 out of 89 in this stand;
134.5;1;Warner to Dhoni, 1 run and he takes a single off the fifth ball again, dabbed to third man;
134.4;?;Warner to Dhoni, no run kicked away outside leg this time;
134.3;4;Warner to Dhoni, FOUR runs Dhoni reaches the highest score by an Indian wicketkeeper. He could bat blindfolded today. Short ball outside leg with a strong leg-side field, but he has pulled this between deep midwicket and long-on;
134.2;2;Warner to Dhoni, 2 runs leading edge as he looks to work this to leg. Soft impact towards long-on, and he pushes and pushes and comes back for two;
134.1;?;Warner to Dhoni, no run flighted outside leg, defended to short leg, he overbalances, and then dives back into the crease;
53.6;4;Siddle to Tendulkar, FOUR runs and Tendulkar immediately shows the bat to the umpire. This is swinging in a bit much, and he has glanced it fine. Seems on first viewing that it comes off the pad, but Tendulkar is quick to let the umpire know that he got a touch to it. Runs called. He clearly hit the ball, but Tendulkar wasn't taking any chances there;
53.5;?;Siddle to Tendulkar, no run presses a long way forward to defend this inswinger;
53.4;?;Siddle to Tendulkar, no run more swing in, defended to short midwicket this time;
53.3;?;Siddle to Tendulkar, no run fuller, Tendulkar puts the stride in. It snakes in and bounces a little extra, hitting him high on the bat;
53.2;?;Siddle to Tendulkar, no run short of a length, not too wide, which means Tendulkar's punch can't beat short cover;
53.1;1;Siddle to Kohli, 1 run swinging in for Siddle too, but too far down leg, and he takes an easy single;
52.6;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run short of a length, just outside off, played to point with an open face;
52.5;?;Pattinson to Tendulkar, no run short of a length, tailing in, nicely defended as he rises with the bounce;

133.6;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run tossed up outside off, defended back to Lyon;
133.5;1;Lyon to Dhoni, 1 run sharp turn, Dhoni plays with soft hands, gets a single to third man. He is still haring down the wicket;
133.4;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run short of a length, turning in, defended to short midwicket;
133.3;2;Lyon to Dhoni, 2 runs nicely played. Stands tall, waits for this short ball to turn in, and opens the face late. Takes another couple. The field looks prone;
133.2;2;Lyon to Dhoni, 2 runs short, wide, dabbed away past point for a couple that takes the lead past 100;
133.1;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run short of a length, he goes back to defend this back to Lyon;
132.6;1;Warner to Dhoni, 1 run sharp turn and bounce, and Dhoni dabs it away for a single to short third man. Dhoni is doing pretty much as he likes. Farming strikes, taking singles off the last ball, hitting sixes whenever he fancies;
132.5;?;Warner to Dhoni, no run sharp turn from out of the rough, hits him on the chest, but Dhoni is not bothered;
132.4;?;Warner to Dhoni, no run tries reverse sweep, misses, but this is pitched outside leg;
132.3;?;Warner to Dhoni, no run lets him hit on the pad after it pitches well outside leg;
132.2;?;Warner to Dhoni, no run punched away to deep cover, but he turns down the single;
132.1;?;Warner to Dhoni, no run way outside leg, hipped away;
51.6;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run nicely bowled. Tossed up widish, and Tendulkar moves forward to smother the turn again;
51.5;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run tossed up nicely, Tendulkar moves forward to smother it;
51.4;1;Lyon to Kohli, 1 run fifty for Kohli. Lyon is too short again, and he goes back to place it past short leg. Positive innings, composed innings;
51.3;1;Lyon to Tendulkar, 1 run;
51.2;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run pushed well forward to defend this;
51.1;1;Lyon to Kohli, 1 run uppish flick from outside off, but straight of short midwicket;

50.5;?;Starc to Tendulkar, no run wide of the crease, angling into the pads, defended to short midwicket;
50.4;?;Starc to Tendulkar, no run full, nearly a yorker, outside off, dug out;
50.3;?;Starc to Tendulkar, no run angling in towards off, defended off the front foot;
50.2;?;Starc to Tendulkar, no run well bowled. Holds its line against the angle. Tendulkar defends off the front foot;
50.1;?;Starc to Tendulkar, no run short of a length, outside off, pushed to point;
49.6;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run this is better. A little shorter than being a half-volley, and draws a respectful defensive from Kohli;
49.5;4;Lyon to Kohli, FOUR runs lovely shot. Tossed up a little too far. Kohli knows he can reach the pitch of the ball if he stretches. And stretch he does, and drives it against the turn, along the ground, and past cover for four more;
49.4;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run allows him to go back again by pitching short. Kohli defends well;
49.3;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run flighted outside off, and defended solidly to cover;
49.2;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run short of a length, bounces towards the ribs, defended off the back foot;
49.1;2;Lyon to Kohli, 2 runs driven against the turn, past cover, along the ground;
48.6;?;Starc to Tendulkar, no run stays full, but adjusts the line to off. Defended back to him;
48.5;4;Starc to Tendulkar, FOUR runs and he gifts him a boundary first up. Too full, too straight, and Tendulkar guides it fine for four;
48.4;?;Starc to Tendulkar, no run full toss, wide, doesn't get all on it, edges it to keeper. On the bounce, of course;
48.3;?;Starc to Tendulkar, no run slower ball, on a length, defended well off the front foot;
48.2;1;Starc to Kohli, 1 run short of a length, kicks at him, Kohli rides the bounce well and gets a single to third man;
48.1;2;Starc to Kohli, 2 runs length ball, angling into the pads, clipped away wide of deep midwicket for a couple;
131.6;1;Lyon to Dhoni, 1 run looks for that vertical sweep again, gets a single to short fine;
131.5;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run short, outside leg, looks to pull it fine behind the wicket, but misses;
131.4;6;Lyon to Dhoni, SIX runs Dhoni is toying around with Lyon here. This is a serious innings. Down the wicket, close to its pitch, and drills it over long-off with a flat six;
131.3;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run kicked away;
131.2;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run;
131.1;6;Lyon to Dhoni, SIX runs Dhoni keeps on chugging along. He fancies Lyon a lot. Skips down the track, gets too close to it, ends up dragging and lofting it to deep midwicket. Henriques sets under it, but he clears him;
130.6;1;Pattinson to Dhoni, 1 run Dhoni has taken that single on a racing bike. I am not sure I have seen somebody take a single quicker than this. Driven straight to mid-off, he wants to retain the strike, and he just sets off. There is dust flying all over as he mauls the pitch with his speed, and beats the throw;
130.5;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run dabbed away to point this time;
130.4;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run punched away to deep point, but refuses the single;
130.3;4;Pattinson to Dhoni, FOUR runs wheels are coming off. Misfield by Starc now. By Australian fast bowlers' standards, I mean. Indian fast bowlers would have let it through anyway. Pulled away to the left of Starc at deep square, he puts in the dive, gets both hands to it, but he can't keep it in. Dhoni reaches the highest score by an Indian captain against Australia;
130.2;2;Pattinson to Dhoni, 2 runs short of a length, into the body, and he has placed this between deep square and deep midwicket for a couple, and keeps the strike;
130.1;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run lovely yorker from Pattinson, Dhoni keeps it out, but it takes a massive effort from him;
47.6;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run down the track, gets too close to the pitch of the ball, and aborts any attacking shot he might have thought of playing;
47.5;1;Lyon to Kohli, 1 run a little short, worked away for a single to long leg. He needs to cut out this short ball;
47.4;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run flighted outside off again, not quite the driving length but not short either. Defended off the front foot;
47.3;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run a little straighter this time, and he defends to leg;
47.2;4;Lyon to Kohli, FOUR runs beautiful shot. Flighted outside off, Kohli strides forward, is right close to the pitch of the ball, and drives it against the turn, along the ground, and through the small gap between mid-off and cover;
47.1;?;Lyon to Kohli, no run flighted outside off, defended off the front foot;
46.6;1;Starc to Kohli, 1 run lovely yorker 138ks. Kohli is looking to play this to leg, is hit on the back of the bat for a single to third man;
46.5;?;Starc to Kohli, no run length ball, middle and leg, defended to leg;
46.4;?;Starc to Kohli, no run wide from wide of the crease, Kohli needn't play at it;
46.4;1w;Starc to Kohli, 1 wide bouncer, but loopy, and called a wide for height;
46.3;?;Starc to Kohli, no run full and straight, nearly a yorker, defended back to him;
46.2;?;Starc to Kohli, no run slower ball, 127ks, left alone wide outside off, falls when in short of Wade and bounces into his chest;
46.1;?;Starc to Kohli, no run angling in from short of a length, defended off the back foot;
129.6;?;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, no run defended off the front foot;
129.5;1;Lyon to Dhoni, 1 run turning in sharply, worked around the corner for a single off the fifth ball of the over;
129.4;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run yorker on off, dug out back to him;
129.3;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run swept away wide of deep midwicket, but Dhoni refuses the single. I presume he is shieldin BK from Pattinson, but against Lyon he wants to just him and hence wants the strike;
129.2;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run swept away, but can't beat short fine leg;
129.1;4;Lyon to Dhoni, FOUR runs Warner misfields. That's strange. Read that again if you don't believe it. Helicopter shot. Drilled same at Warner, but he lets it through at long, and apologises immediately;
128.6;1;Pattinson to Dhoni, 1 run dabs this away for a single, and retains the strike;
128.5;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run short of a length, outside off, this time he guides it straight to point;
128.4;2;Pattinson to Dhoni, 2 runs nicely played. Slower ball, 121ks, he steers it wide of point, and charges up and down for a two before third man can come around and throw;
128.3;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run pulled away nicely, but doesn't beat fine leg, nor does he expose BK to Pattinson;
128.2;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run looks for a big hit from way outside off, ends up dragging the slower ball to deep midwicket. Dhoni refuses the single;
128.1;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run short of a length, seaming in, Dhoni refuses a single to fine leg;
45.6;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run flatter this time, and easily defended off the back foot;
45.5;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run tossed up again, and he gets more turn and bounce. But because it is too wide, Tendulkar can kick it away;
45.4;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run fuller this time, and he draws some response from the pitch with extra bounce, and Tendulkar defends off the higher part of the bat;
45.3;1;Lyon to Kohli, 1 run short again, and he gets another single;
45.2;1;Lyon to Tendulkar, 1 run short again, worked around the corner for another single. Lyon has served up easy singles too often;
45.1;1;Lyon to Kohli, 1 run short of a length, middle and leg, defended off the back foot;
44.6;?;Starc to Tendulkar, no run slower ball, on a length, on off, adjusts well to defend it back;
44.5;1;Starc to Kohli, 1 run wide half-volley, driven to deep cover for one;
44.4;?;Starc to Kohli, no run wide outside off, left alone;
44.3;?;Starc to Kohli, no run length ball, on off, defended to cover;
44.2;?;Starc to Kohli, no run that's a big wide down leg. Wade takes three steps and then dives to ensure this doesn't go for byes;
44.1;?;Starc to Kohli, no run full, angling in, defended to short midwicket;
127.6;2;Siddle to Bhuvneshwar, 2 runs low full toss, into the pads, clipped away for a couple, wide of long leg;
127.5;?;Siddle to Bhuvneshwar, no run slower ball, full, on off, defended back to him;
127.4;?;Siddle to Bhuvneshwar, no run bouncer, doesn't get high, but too far outside off to make him play;
127.3;?;Siddle to Bhuvneshwar, no run swinging in towards off, defended to mid-off;
127.2;?;Siddle to Bhuvneshwar, no run swinging into the pads, defended to short midwicket;
127.1;?;Siddle to Bhuvneshwar, no run swinging in towards off, defended off the front foot;
126.6;4;Pattinson to Dhoni, FOUR runs what a shot to bring up the 150. That is a hockey flick. Bottom-hand grip, no back lift of follow-through, and places this length ball between cover and extra cover. Again, he calmly accepts the applause;
126.5;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run full, outside off, defended back to him;
126.4;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run short of a length, pulled away, but can't beat short midwicket;
126.3;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run slower ball, dabbed away to third man, but he refuses the single that would have got him to his 150. He is more bothered about shielding BK from Pattinson;
126.2;2lb;Pattinson to Dhoni, 2 leg byes short now, angling in, beats the pull, goes off the thigh pad for a couple of leg-byes;
126.1;4;Pattinson to Dhoni, FOUR runs what a welcome for Pattinson. Dhoni is going after every new bowler's first over. Lofts this lenght ball well over mid-off. This is Dhoni's personal best in Tests;
43.6;?;Henriques to Tendulkar, no run short of a length, he looks to work this to leg, but the ball doesn't quite come on and takes a soft leading edge to the bowler. Along the ground;
43.5;?;Henriques to Tendulkar, no run fuller, swinging in, but he gets that long stride in to defend;
43.4;?;Henriques to Tendulkar, no run keeps a little low from short of a lenght, Tendulkar keeps it out well. And doesn't squat;

124.6;1;Lyon to Dhoni, 1 run and he takes a single to wide of point to keep the strike;
124.5;4;Lyon to Dhoni, FOUR runs this is perhaps why he wasn't taking singles. Drilled down to long-off where Pattinson puts in a good effort by throwing the ball back in before he overbalances over the ropes, but the ball has a lot of momentum and follows it;
124.4;2;Lyon to Dhoni, 2 runs down the wick, on the pads, and he whips it fine of deep square for a couple. Good diving effort from Start;
124.3;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run short of a length, outside off, dabbed to point;
124.2;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run nudged past short leg, but for some reason he refuses the single. The first time I have seen them do this;

40.2;1;Clarke to Tendulkar, 1 run worked away off the pads for a single;
40.1;?;Clarke to Tendulkar, no run that's a spitting cobra, and now Clarke smiles. From outside leg that jumps towards the throat. Tendulkar defends with the bottom hand off even as his head falls back;
123.6;4lb;Starc to Bhuvneshwar, 4 leg byes angling down the leg side. They have given Wade tough time today. Mostly it has been the lack of bounce, but this is way down the leg side, and BK also gets a nudge off the pad for four leg-byes past the diving Wade. Lead reaches 50;

123.4;1;Starc to Dhoni, 1 run full, on off, dug out towards deepish mid-on for one;

38.6;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run fullish outside off, left alone;
38.5;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run loose shot. Siddle goes wide of the crease, which makes Kohli play at a wide delivery. Short of a length it is, holds its line, and beats the push;

38.3;?;Siddle to Kohli, no run defended off the back foot;
38.2;1;Siddle to Tendulkar, 1 run short of a length, goes back to dab it in front of square. Warner flies through the air after running from point. He has not saved a run or created an opportunity, but that was spectacular;

24.2;1;Starc to Tendulkar, 1 run pushed wide of cover for a sharp single. Tendulkar is slow, rather he has misjudged this run, and was a goner had Warner hit the stumps direct;
24.1;1lb;Starc to Pujara, 1 leg bye full, yorker, into the pads, headed down leg. Concedes a leg-bye;
107.6;?;Lyon to Dhoni, no run length ball outside off, turns in, goes off the inside edge onto the pad;

106.2;?;Siddle to Dhoni, no run full and straight again, defended this time;
106.1;4;Siddle to Dhoni, FOUR runs what a way to bring up the hundred. Skips down the track, adjusts for the late movement, and lofts this over square leg for four. The roof of the stadium comes off. Coolly he accepts the applause. Doesn't even remove his helmet;
23.6;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run another forward-defensive to end the over;
23.5;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run defended off the front foot;
23.4;1;Lyon to Pujara, 1 run short of a length, punched to long-on for one;
23.3;4;Lyon to Pujara, FOUR runs short, turning from well wide, and the extra bounce doesn't mean much because there is no point in place, and he gets four for it;

105.6;?;Lyon to Harbhajan, no run not paying a shot, on the back foot, the ball is turning in, that has to be a very good shout, but not given. Like with Tendulkar yesterday, this ball dips on Harbhajan, and he aborts the defensive and shoulders arms. The ball turns back, doesn't bounce alarmingly, and hits him not far from off. A long appeal fails to withdraw a response. That's a very very good shout with not too far for the ball to go;
105.5;?;Lyon to Harbhajan, no run length ball offbreak, Harbhajan stays back to defend;
105.4;W;Lyon to Ashwin, OUT flighted delivery outside off, Ashwin wants to drive it towards mid-on, gets an inside edge onto the pad, and it then rolls onto the stumps. Sixth bowled dismissal in the innings. Seven is the record, I am being told;Ravichandran Ashwin b Lyon 3 (13m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;

21.3;1;Lyon to Tendulkar, 1 run driven down to long-on for one;
21.2;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run huge appeal. The question here is, did he play a shot? I think he didn't. Flighted outside off, dips on him. Tendulkar is looking to defend, but because if the dip he decides to pad it away. Did it turn back enough? Anyone's guess. The umpire thinks there is too long a distance to go between the pad and the stumps. Or did he actually think he ewas playing a shot? Because he wasn't;
21.1;2;Lyon to Tendulkar, 2 runs turning in sharply from outside off, but he is too short again, and Tendulkar guides him fine for a couple;
20.6;1;Starc to Tendulkar, 1 run length ball outside off, pushed through point for one;
20.5;1;Starc to Pujara, 1 run length ball, on the pads, flicked away for one to long leg;

103.6;2;Starc to Ashwin, 2 runs edged away, soft, dying, to the left of slip, but Clarke does very well to get a hand to it, and save two runs;

102.6;W;Pattinson to Jadeja, OUT and Jadeja falls 284 runs short of what would have been a fourth first-class triple-century. Pattinson bowls short of a length, not too far outside off, Jadeja leaves it alone in a premeditated fashion, and he hits the top of off. Pattinson's big effort continues;Ravindra Jadeja b Pattinson 16 (63m 45b 3x4 0x6) SR: 35.55;

19.6;?;Lyon to Pujara, no run flighted well outside off, and padded away;
19.5;1;Lyon to Tendulkar, 1 run sharp turn from outside off, but it starts short, and he goes back and bunts this wide of short leg for one;
19.4;?;Lyon to Tendulkar, no run flighted outside off, he gets the big stride in and defends with bat and pad close together;
19.3;1;Lyon to Pujara, 1 run down the wicket to drive this to long-on for one;

101.4;?;Starc to Jadeja, no run goes for the fuller swinging delivery, but it is down leg;
101.3;?;Starc to Jadeja, no run bouncer, Jadeja avoids it but only just. Nipping back into him too. And he is done in by the quickness of it. It's the ball that has avoided Jadeja more than the other way around;
101.2;?;Starc to Jadeja, no run swinging in, Jadeja has no clue about this, gets a thick inside edge as he pushes away from the body;
101.1;2lb;Starc to Jadeja, 2 leg byes Jadeja continues to live dangerously. Sharp inducker, draws a half shout, but it is a bit high. Jadeja takes two leg-byes fine of third man;
100.6;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run slower ball, outside off, Dhoni defends it to point;
100.5;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run looks to punch this away, but he is cramped for room, and plays this to cover;

100.3;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run;
100.2;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run lovely slower ball at 122ks. It has done Dhoni in, has drawn a huge appeal for lbw. Dhoni shows the bat immediately, but not sure if there is an edge. Pitched on off, doesn't cut in much, hits him on the thigh of the back leg, but it is bent. Replays show an inside edge, though. Another good call from Dharma;
100.1;?;Pattinson to Dhoni, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the back foot;
17.6;1;Henriques to Tendulkar, 1 run full, on off, driven, mid-off is deep, and they pinch a single;

17.3;1;Henriques to Pujara, 1 run short of a length, outside off, dabbed away wide of the wide slip for a single. And he overtakes Tendulkar;
17.2;?;Henriques to Pujara, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the front foot;
17.1;4;Henriques to Pujara, FOUR runs superbly flicked away. That's a whiplash. On a length, on off, and he doesn't hold back with the flick past square leg;
16.6;1;Siddle to Pujara, 1 run fullish outside off, pushed past cover for one;
16.5;?;Siddle to Pujara, no run full, swinging in late, beats the inside edge, but it is headed down leg;

16.1;1;Siddle to Pujara, 1 run full, on off, pushed wide of mid-on for one;

cris: "Although these two batsmen have looked looked good in the middle, all Aus need is one more wicket and they'll be into a brittle middle order. Need a 150 partnership for the game to come back to parity.."
Lyon is out of the attack. Siddle comes back. I just hope Pattinson is not injured. He has bowled three overs and has taken two wickets

65.5;W;Ashwin to Starc, OUT Ashwin gets a second five-for for the match. No. 12 for him. Starc was not going to die wondering, but he was going to die nonetheless. This is tossed up high by Ashwin, too much for Starc to resist, the ball grips the surface, makes him mis-hit, and Tendulkar takes an easy catch at deepish mid-on;Mitchell Starc c Tendulkar b Ashwin 8 (9m 7b 2x4 0x6) SR: 114.28;

49.3;W;Ashwin to Clarke, OUT Huge wicket of Clarke arrives. It took a really naughty trick from the pitch to get him. Flighted but short, Clarke goes back to cut, but it spins sharply and stays low, and hits his back pad just in front of off. Was it spinning too much? I doubt. For he is on the back foot and there isn't a long way to go;Michael Clarke lbw b Ashwin 31 (70m 51b 4x4 1x6) SR: 60.78;

41.3;?;Jadeja to Wade, no run slower through the air, wider, defended;

39.4;?;Jadeja to Wade, no run looks to sweep from wide outside off, the ball stays low, and beats him;
39.3;3;Jadeja to Clarke, 3 runs nicely played. Can't take anything away from Clarke the batsman. Goes back to late-cut almost a lenght delivery, and gets three for it;

39.1;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run full, middle and leg, defended back to him;

38.5;W;Harbhajan to Warner, OUT Bhajji gets the wicket, and it's his trademark lbw to a left-hander. The ball drifts, pitches middle, holds its line, beats the inside edge and traps the batsman in the front. All boxes ticked on this one. And it's pad-first. We've been expecting you, Mr Singh;David Warner lbw b Harbhajan Singh 23 (82m 61b 2x4 0x6) SR: 37.7;
38.4;?;Harbhajan to Warner, no run length ball, offbreak from off, stays back to punch it to cover;

37.6;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run driven powerfully, has got Vijay at silly point in the boot;
37.5;4;Jadeja to Clarke, FOUR runs full, on the pads, and Clarke whips it away through midwicket. The runs keep coming. How long will Dhoni keep those fielders in? He has the cushion to afford it, though;
37.4;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run and now it turns sharply away from the same spot. Can't do much with those and hope you don't edge them. He doesn't this time;
37.3;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run huge appeal again as he beats the inside edge with the non-turner, but it seams headed down leg;
37.2;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run short of a length, he stays back to defend;
37.1;4;Jadeja to Clarke, FOUR runs lovely shot. This is an interesting period of play. Australia doing the right thing by attacking here. Half-volley on the pads, and he drills it through mid-on for four. Superb drive;
36.6;4;Ashwin to Warner, FOUR runs slow-sweep from Warner this time, and he clears midwicket with ease. Australia need to do this: counterattack and get those fielders out of their faces;
36.5;?;Ashwin to Warner, no run Warner looks to pull this short ball, It turns takes the toe end of the bat and nearly carries for a return catch;
36.4;?;Ashwin to Warner, no run full, defended back;
36.3;4;Ashwin to Warner, FOUR runs long hop, middle and off, and it's important Warner keeps putting these balls away, which he does through midwicket;

36.1;?;Ashwin to Warner, no run on a length, on off, gets turn and bounce, Warner defends with soft hands;

35.2;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run full, middle and leg, defended back to Jadeja;
35.1;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run looks to cut. This is not that short. And is beaten as it turns away too;

33.3;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run flighted on off again, defended to short leg;
33.2;?;Jadeja to Clarke, no run flighted on off, defended back to Jadeja;
33.1;1;Jadeja to Warner, 1 run Warner, too, tries the big shot, but this is a lower percentage shot than Clarke's. He sweeps powerfully, in the air, and it falls just short of long leg;
32.6;?;Ashwin to Clarke, no run short of a length, turning in, worked to backward short leg;
32.5;?;Ashwin to Clarke, no run turning in off a length, defended to short leg;
32.4;4;Ashwin to Clarke, FOUR runs yes the plan has altered. Ashwin pitches short, Clarke goes back and pulls it away for four. This is very good batting;
32.3;6;Ashwin to Clarke, SIX runs Clarke takes Ashwin on. A very skilful and brave shot. Dances down the wicket on this bunsen, and lofts Aswhin for a six over wide long-on. This should make Ashwin alter his plan;
32.2;2;Ashwin to Clarke, 2 runs flatter, shorter, flicked away properly this time, gets a couple through square leg;
32.1;?;Ashwin to Clarke, no run Clarke flicks but the turn takes it finer than he wants. Falls just short of backward short leg. Kohli is the man. In fact it carried, but Kohli has dropped it;
31.6;?;Jadeja to Warner, no run full and wide, left alone this time;
31.5;?;Jadeja to Warner, no run full, flat, turning in towards off, defended off the front foot;
31.4;?;Jadeja to Warner, no run flatter, quicker, defended off the back foot;
31.3;?;Jadeja to Warner, no run another big turner, across his body. Even Dhoni struggles to gather it;
31.2;?;Jadeja to Warner, no run this is shorter, defended off the back foot;
31.1;?;Jadeja to Warner, no run gets bat-pad, but it goes too straight of Vijay at forward short leg;
30.6;?;Ashwin to Clarke, no run flighted well outside off, Clarke covers the stumps and shoulders arms;
30.5;?;Ashwin to Clarke, no run carrom ball first up, on a length, middle and leg, holds its line. Defended back to him;
30.4;1;Ashwin to Warner, 1 run flighted again, driven wide of the bowler;
30.3;?;Ashwin to Warner, no run full and straight, doesn't turn, Warner gets some bat on it;
30.2;?;Ashwin to Warner, no run Warner down the wicket, beaten comprehensively in the flight, but jabs at it to get some touch so as to avoid a stumping. Luckily for him, it doesn't lob up in the air;
30.1;?;Ashwin to Warner, no run full, nearly a yorker, dug out;

Quotes from presentation
"Full credit has to go to India," says Michael Clarke. "They played outstandingly, especially Dhoni. That innings changed the game completely. And Ashin's bowling. Moises' debut is a positive, but we have got to turn things around. Work hard in the nets and get ready for the next Test match. The pitch looked a lot worse than it played. second innings, it played tougher, but that's what you expect in the subcontinent. No excuses, we got outplayed."
"Yes I have spent a lot of time here," says MS Dhoni, who is also the Man of the Match. "I love the people out here. Fantastic crowd. Good to see people come for Test matches in India. It was important to play some shots. If you have those extra catching fielders, you might make one mistake and end your innings. I had to play a few shots to try and spread the field. The first partnership was important. Sachin and Pujara batted for a period of time. Virat and Sachin was crucial. It tired the bowlers a bit. Those partnerships were crucial. Ashwin bowled brilliantly. In the second innings, he was well supported by Bhajji. Ashwin stuck with his offspinners, which was good. He was willing to bowl in one area, and that's a big positive. It's important to be focussed now, but at the same time it is important that the bowlers take some time off now. Never dreamt I would get a double in Tests. I had never even dreamt of playing for the country. Let's just keep it simple."
10.51am So India have won by eight wickets. Hand shakes all around. Dhoni will be a relieved man. And boy has he earned that relief with a killer innings. Ashwin is handed a stump by the loyal home ground staff who secured one for him. It was a good comeback for Ashwin too after a disappointing series against England. Dhoni now goes level with Ganguly as most successful Indian captains: 21 wins
The only worries for India to emerge from this match: not finishing off the tail, and the openers' woes. Australia will have a lot to get their heads around: informed player management, number of spinners, I suppose Lyon will keep his place as he deserves to, the identity of the other spinner, Clarke's batting position

9.3;6;Lyon to Tendulkar, SIX runs and Tendulkar is in a hurry. Is this the first time he has hit a six off the first ball in a Test innings? All men around the bat, and he takes a length ball from outside off and lofts it over long-on;
9.2;W;Lyon to Sehwag, OUT this is a dismissal you see very rarely with Sehwag. Out defending to a spinner. The only two times I remember this is today and Mumbai second innings against England. Psychological blows against the openers struck. Sehwag pushes out in defence, the ball doesn't turn, takes the edge, and slip does the rest. Crowd, though, is cheering. We know why. Come on Tendulkar, disappoint the. Send Kohli in;Virender Sehwag c Clarke b Lyon 19 (37m 23b 3x4 0x6) SR: 82.6;

Especially against the openers. An opportunity for the Indian openers to otherwise, and get this with all wickets in hand. Just imagine this is Ranji, and you are fighting for a bonus point
