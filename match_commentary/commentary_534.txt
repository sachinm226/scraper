Data
New Zealand end up with a competitive score of 244. Australia, looked like restricting them to a total much lesser than that, especially when Clarke was bowling but Taylor's batting in the final 10 overs ensured that the effect was neutralized.
It will all depend on the start that the Australian top-order can get. Join us in about thirty-five minutes for the start of the Australian innings

 Innings Start
Hussey brothers make sure that the series goes to Brisbane with everything to play for. They were helped in good part by Haddin too
After the dismissal of Haddin, it seemed that the Kiwis had the upper hand but the partnership between the Hussey brothers dashed all the hopes of a victory and it will be all down to the final match in Brisbane on Friday. Hold on for a few minutes for the presentation
Michael Hussey compliments Ferguson for his coolness under pressure and also compliments his brother on his good knock.
Vettori says "It was disappointing not to get to a total we expected. It will be everything to play for in Brisbane. It will be pretty exciting"
Ponting is happy that his bowlers did a good job in restricting the Kiwi batsmen bar the batting Powerplay and is pretty appreciative of Michael Hussey and Michael Clarke.
David Hussey is the Man of the match and he admits he was nervous after the Haddin dismissal. He is thankful that his brother calmed the nerves and allowed him a free hand.
Join us on Friday for the decider in Brisbane. Till then, good night from all of us at Cricinfo
