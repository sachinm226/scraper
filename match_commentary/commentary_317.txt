Kula leads the team off the field. Slater's there to interview him.
Kula: "Very happy I have taken five, I bowled line and length. The two new balls were swinging. Very hot today. Clarke's was a special wicket."
A trainwreck of a scorecard. The one positive being they went past their all-time lowest of 70. If you guys couldn't catch the action, you missed some amazing inswing bowling by one of the world's most underrated seamers. Kula's line to the right-handers was top class.
Bad batting? No. I think excellent seam bowling was the story of the afternoon. Any side would have struggled - B team, A team, you name it.
3.40pm: We will be back in ten minutes.
26.4;W;Eranga to Doherty, OUT so 74 it is! Soft dismissal to end the innings and fitting too when you look at the scorecard, he was trying to work it to the on side, leading edge popped up to cover;Xavier Doherty c Mendis b Eranga 15 (41m 27b 3x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;

24.1;?;Eranga to Starc, no run appeal for a catch but it looked like it hit Starc's helmet, it was a short delivery and he swiveled to hook and the ball brushed past the glove and lobbed off the helmet to point, the Sri Lankans thought it hit glove but Reiffel wasn't so sure. Good decision by the umpire, Starc asks for a change of helmet;

Hot day in Brisbane.
The start is about five minutes away
Danushka: "Now claiming the fielding laws are negative ,Mahela is going to keep the spinners out of the game .That is the real negative approach. Come on bring on "Akila". At the end of the day the new fielding laws might actually benefit the spinners by making them aggressive."
Toss: Australia have won the toss and they will bat first. Still waiting for word on the SL line-up.
Sri Lanka: Dilshan, Tharanga, Mahela, Thirimanne, Kushal Perera, Mathews, J Mendis, T Perera, Kulasekara, Malingta, Eranga.
Bad news for Chandimal fans because he is not playing. Kushal will continue as keeper. Eranga replaces Ajantha Mendis. Nice to see Eranga back though.
The line-up: Warner, Hughes, Clarke, Hussey, Bailey, Wade, Henriques, Johnson, Starc, McKay, Doherty.
What I find really amusing is how some of you have mistaken the 'A' team for a 'weaker' side. It's a spin on the motion picture by the same title, released a couple of years ago. It was originally a TV series. Look it up on the internet.
At last somebody has understood the 'A' team concept! Here's Paul: "From the current squad I would love to know who would be MR T".
Rajan: "Rajan: "What do the viewers have to give to see SL bat first at once!!"
12.40pm: Welcome everyone to the coverage of the 3rd ODI at the Gabba. Sri Lanka v Australia or the 'A' team as we'd like to call it. The familiar names are back for Australia after getting a rest over the first two games.
Just to clear the confusion about what 'A' team means. Read the preview.
 Innings Start
Clarke: "A horrible day. Probably should have bowled first. But if you bat like that in any conditions, you will lose. Our defence let us down more than anything. No excuse for the way we performed. Shot selection was poor. I understand the public wants us playing consistently. Honestly, if we played like that (today) then the public wouldn't want to see us playing at all. Our bowlers did a good job."
Clarke was clearly peeved with himself for the way he and his team played. Nice to see a captain be so honest about his own team. Not all captains in world cricket today can say 'yes we messed up real bad.' You have to admire Clarke for that.
Nuwan Kulasekara is the Man of the Match. A no-brainer. Sometime later, see if you guys can catch the highlights on Youtube or TV and see how he squared everyone up with his inswing.
Sri Lanka are 2-1 up ahead of the 4th ODI, They won't be so happy about the way they chased this, but that's a worry for another day. They can afford to savour 74 all out today. Great performance in the field.
Thanks for your company. Thanks for the mails. The 4th match is on the 20th, same time, at the SCG. Cheers!
