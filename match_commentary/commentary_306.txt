3.25pm They were 60 after 10 overs and have finished on 300 after 50. The difference is they have scored 104 in the last 10 overs with the help of Bailey, Wade and Maxwell.

A pretty strong start form Australia after the Powerplay. They started slow, a few edges flew around, especially from Warner, but they both have picked up after settling down. South African attack not looking in its element today
 Innings Start
7.50pm So Australia go 1-0 up with a 32-run win even though the margin could have been bigger. SA were well on track with that partnership between de Villiers and Miller, and they had hopes even after Miller fell. But AB's run out was the turning point and the short-ball barrage from Coulter-Nile and Hazlewood was outstanding.
Sriniwas: "I missed Duminy a lot today. Because inadvertently, he was he one who use to hold up the middle and tail order, whenever the top order failed"
Charlie: "The old saying rings true "catches win matches""
Nathan Coulter-Nile is the Man of the Match: Mitch was bowling rockets so bowling was easier. Our first game back in the summer and were slightly lacklustre, sloppy in the field but it turned out pretty well. Very good knock form George Bailey and it was a pretty good wicket. The WACA pitch was a bit slower than usual.
AB de Villiers: We didn't do well in all three depts. Our bowling was good at times but no consistency and we lost wickets at the wrong time. Very disappointing. We'll have to fix our mistakes for the second game. I'm not sure about the team changes right now, we'll see that tomorrow. [Run out with Steyn] has happened before, not our first time. He wasn't sure and I was so he sent me back, no hard feelings.
George Bailey: Reasonably happy with our bowling, taking early wickets was important. It would have been nice to finish it earlier but pretty happy with out bowling and fielding. Hope I get some sort of luck for the rest of my career as well after those dropped catches. 250 I think was what were looking at and then we kept adding, Maxi was in the shed and so was Coulter-Nile, all good strikers of the ball. Nathan maybe thought our fielding was sloppy because he saw much more. I was too involved with the captaincy and we challenged ourselves after the second drinks break.
That's all we have from the first ODI, join us again on Sunday at the same time for the match on the same ground. Till then, goodbye!
