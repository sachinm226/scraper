James B: "Brilliant death bowling from aus here. Were staring at 340 plus with 10 to get and 8 wickets left in the england shed. But a fantastic 6 for 59 has left them with a gettable 304 which seems at least 20 below par. Aus batsmen like finch will enjoy being able to hit through the line. "
Here's some reading material between innings: When he was a young and ferocious fast bowler, Len Pascoe wanted the batsmen to be afraid of him. But he also had his own fear. That he would hit someone too badly.
6.00pm England were 244 for 2 at the end of the 40th over. Bell looked on course for a double century. But Sandhu's double strike in the 42nd over stalled their momentum, and Starc and Faulkner followed that up with some brilliant death bowling. Only 59 came off the last 10 overs, only 27 off the last five, and Australia are in with a real chance of winning this. It's still a 300-plus target, though, Australia have a second-choice batting line-up, and England have a pretty good pace attack. Should make for a cracking chase.
49.6;W;Starc to Broad, OUT and that's another run-out, is it? Yup, and Australia have a team hat-trick to finish the innings. Broad makes room and Starc spears in another yorker, just outside off. For some reason, Broad didn't even attempt a shot and they looked for another bye. Haddin rolled it into the base of the stumps, and Woakes was well short of his crease.;Chris Woakes run out (?Haddin) 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
49.5;W;Starc to Woakes, OUT another, and it's a run out this time. Length ball, swinging away from off stump. Woakes swings and misses and they try to sneak a bye. Haddin's throw knocks back middle stump, and Buttler is short of his crease despite putting in the dive;Jos Buttler run out (?Haddin) 25 (38m 24b 2x4 0x6) SR: 104.16;

9.3;1;Sandhu to Bell, 1 run back of a length outside off, and Bell plays that trademark dab down to third man. Stands tall, lets it come on, and pretty much just lets it hit his bat;

 Innings Start
10.30pm That's all from us, from this highly entertaining game in Hobart. Australia have three wins out of three now, which means they are through to the final. England's defeat gives India a window of hope of reaching the final themselves. Make sure you join us for the next game, whenever that is (I'm pretty bad with itineraries). Until then, ta ta!
10.25pm Presentation time. Eoin Morgan: "Wasn't a bad day in general. We played good cricket in stages. Ian Bell was magnificent but the last 10 overs let us down a little bit. Credit to Australia for how they bowled at the death. Having watched most of it and faced one ball of it, today was their day. It was extremely difficult to set up to and the variations were pretty good. I think 300 was about par. If they hadn't bowled that well at the death we would have got 340-350, a matchwinning score."
Steven Smith is the man of the match: "It's nice to get a few runs again tonight and get the boys over the line. A lot of credit has to go to our bowlers for how they bowled in the last 20 overs to keep them down to 300. They are very good at how they bowl at the end and have clear plans, hopefully they can keep that up in the World Cup. 300 was probably a good score for us to chase in the end. I'll never forget this summer. I've really enjoyed it, I've just got to try and keep going and score runs while I'm going well. I thought Haddin really took the pressure off me in the end today. Outstanding. We let it go a little bit later than we would have liked to but Starc came in at the end and put away the first ball. I can't wait to get out at Sydney and play another game at my home ground."
Peter: "England's dreary end to their innings has cost them here. They need more than one batter to click every game... but that's not happening at the moment."
Ashay: "Not to forget that he hit only 7 boundaries (30 runs). Superbly paced innings!!" Indeed. I wonder how difficult it must be for a captain to set a field for him, considering how ridiculously easy he makes it look to shuffle across and work the ball from anywhere outside off stump to anywhere he pleases on the leg side.
10.13pm A bit of tension at the end, but how well did Smith control that chase? He made an exceptional century in a high-pressure chase against South Africa not too long ago, and this innings was just as good, if not better. Good support from Maxwell, Faulkner and Haddin as well. But England really lost the match when they were batting, in the last 10 overs of their innings. Ian Bell will wonder how his innings didn't end up winning his team the match.
49.5;1;Woakes to Starc, 1 run length ball on middle stump and he makes room to slap it away through the off side. Bounces over the fielder at cover, and that's the winning hit;
49.4;1;Woakes to Smith, 1 run full outside off and he shuffles across to flick it to deep midwicket and level the scores;
49.3;W;Woakes to Henriques, OUT gone! That was right up there from Woakes again, and he drove firmly to mid-off and set off for the single. Nervy moment there, and Taylor's throw hit the stumps direct at the bowler's end. He was moving towards extra cover and only had one stump to aim at;Moises Henriques run out (Taylor) 4 (7m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 36.36;
49.2;?;Woakes to Henriques, no run down the track now and Woakes yorks Henriques, who can't get that drive past short cover. Smith was out of his crease at the other end and an accurate throw would have had him out;

47.4;1;Woakes to Smith, 1 run angles this into the pads, and Smith flicks it away to deep square leg;
47.3;W;Woakes to Haddin, OUT and he's gone. That's a short ball, a back-of-the-hand slower ball, and he made himself a lot of room and had to reach out a long way to try and connect. Ended up top-edging it, and the ball looped into point's hands;Brad Haddin c Bell b Woakes 42 (50m 29b 4x4 1x6) SR: 144.82;

47.2;?;Woakes to Haddin, no run slower ball outside off, and Haddin is beaten, through his pull shot too early;
47.1;1;Woakes to Smith, 1 run short ball, pulled down to deep backward square leg, and Smith has a century on captaincy debut in ODIs to go with his century on captaincy debut in Tests. What a player he is.;

46.4;?;Anderson to Smith, no run back of a length outside off, punched into the covers;
46.3;6;Anderson to Smith, SIX runs Taken! Finally someone in the crowd shows some sort of fielding skills, after a rebound off his friend's palms, no less. It was a length ball outside off and Smith sent that soaring over long-on;
46.2;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run shortish slower ball and Haddin swats it away towards deep midwicket;
46.1;2;Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs full on off stump and Haddin steps away from the line and extends his arms to loft that high over mid-off. Doesn't get the desired distance and Finn chases back a long way to try and get under it but the ball drops a safe distance away from him;
45.6;1;Broad to Haddin, 1 run full-toss on off stump, punched back past the bowler, down to long-off;
45.5;1;Broad to Smith, 1 run back of a length outside off, and he shuffles across to work it to deep square leg;

44.5;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run back of a length, follows Haddin who backs away, and he dabs it into the off side for a quick single. Did well to keep that down, because that got a bit big on him and hit his glove;
44.4;4;Finn to Haddin, FOUR runs a little fuller, and Haddin takes a step back into his crease to manufacture hitting room, and launches it into the long-on boundary, one bounce;
44.3;6;Finn to Haddin, SIX runs length ball outside off, and Haddin clears his front leg to launch that back over the bowler's head, sends it soaring high over the boundary, and a spectator drops a simple catch two rows back;

43.3;4;Broad to Haddin, FOUR runs full-toss wide outside off and Haddin picks up another boundary, slicing under the ball to lift that over the backward point fielder. A fairly rotund spectator dives over the boundary hoarding and falls into the playing area in a doomed attempt at fielding the ball;
43.2;?;Broad to Haddin, no run yorker on leg stump, follows Haddin, who jams his bat down to poke that to short midwicket;
43.1;4;Broad to Haddin, FOUR runs back of a length on off stump and Haddin steps away from the line and opens his bat face to steer it between the keeper and short third man. Cheeky and brilliantly executed;

42.5;?;Finn to Smith, no run short and wide once more, and it's punched firmly but Bell stops it with a dive to his right from backward point;

42.3;3;Finn to Haddin, 3 runs length ball outside off, swiped away towards the wide long-on boundary. Root sprints around from deep midwicket to cut it off;

41.4;?;Broad to Smith, no run full outside off, sliced to backward point;
41.3;2;Broad to Smith, 2 runs back of a length outside off and there's that big shuffle and the little tuck towards deep backward square leg;
41.2;4;Broad to Smith, FOUR runs short and very wide, and Smith slaps it away contemptuously to the point boundary. Did very well to reach out and get on top of the bounce. HotSpot says it went off the toe end of his bat;
41.1;?;Broad to Smith, no run fullish outside off, and Smith pokes it away towards backward point;
40.6;3;Finn to Smith, 3 runs length ball, angling in towards middle stump. Smith makes it look like a bad ball by shuffling across and glancing towards the fine leg boundary, but if he missed that, it was a sure lbw. Thing is, he simply doesn't miss, does he? He stays upright and makes sure his head isn't falling over;
40.5;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run short ball, sits up, and he pulls it away to deep square leg;
40.4;1;Finn to Smith, 1 run length ball outside off and he shuffles a long way across to work it to long leg;

40.2;3;Finn to Haddin, 3 runs that's a favourite shot of Haddin's. Steps down the track and launches it over mid-off. Doesn't quite middle it, and it stops well short of the boundary;

38.2;?;Anderson to Smith, no run back of a length again, and this time Smith opens his bat face a touch too early and the inside edge rolls back towards the bowler;
38.1;4;Anderson to Smith, FOUR runs back of a length outside off, and Smith plays the best shot of his innings, standing tall and punching into the gap between point and cover;
37.6;3;Woakes to Smith, 3 runs angled in towards middle stump and he shuffles across to tuck it away towards the square leg boundary. Anderson comes around from deep midwicket and cuts it off with a dive inches from the rope;

37.3;?;Woakes to Haddin, no run back of a length outside off, defended towards point;
37.2;W;Woakes to Faulkner, OUT taken! Bell's grabbed a beauty. Faulkner was halfway forward to drive and it moved away late and caused the bat to turn in his hand and the ball to slice uppishly towards point. It was a low catch, inches off the ground, and Bell made it look much simpler than it was;James Faulkner c Bell b Woakes 35 (44m 43b 4x4 0x6) SR: 81.39;
