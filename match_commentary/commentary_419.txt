Data
Faf du Plessis goes back on a Test average of 266, and the last four SA wickets have tripled the score from 75 to 225. There was some help for the bowlers early on, but it is still not a wicket where you get bowled out for 225 on day one of a Test.
smudgeon: "Three first day wickets on the WACA is a pretty good return for an offie! I have a bit of a giggle every time I read a comment saying that Lyon is the weak link in the Aussie attack, or that Australia should just go with an all-pace attack. Do these people even see Lyon bowl? He's always thinking, and he never loses his cool. Such an underrated bowler. "

 Innings Start
Quite a frenetic few hours of cricket, with Australia falling behind by 62 runs. South Africa have an advantage few would have predicted after they were bowled out for 225. Thanks to some incisive seam bowling by Steyn, Morkel and Philander. Peterson helped himself to three wickets, courtesy two ungainly slogs.
53.1;W;Peterson to Hastings, OUT wow! Super catch at the boundary to round off the innings! Hastings sees the flight and looks to smash that over long-off, Alviro Petersen cupped the catch over his head, realised quickly that he was back-pedalling too far and was inches away from the rope, had the presence of mind to toss the ball up in the air before stepping outside the boundary, kept his eyes on the ball and took the catch inside the boundary, no doubts about that one;John Hastings c Petersen b Peterson 32 (105m 58b 4x4 0x6) SR: 55.17;
52.6;?;Morkel to Starc, no run another slash and a miss, this was on a good length and holding its line, close to the edge;
52.5;?;Morkel to Starc, no run full outside off and Starc goes for the big drive but fails to make any contact;
52.4;1;Morkel to Hastings, 1 run punches it towards cover and looks for the single and possibly more but a good stop at cover limits it to a run;
52.3;?;Morkel to Hastings, no run good length outside off and he pushes it to the off side, tells his partner to wait;
52.2;?;Morkel to Hastings, no run Hastings gets a short and wide one outside off and he half heartedly tries to slash that;
52.1;?;Morkel to Hastings, no run just short of a length and he stays back and defends;
51.6;?;Peterson to Starc, no run comes forward and he pushes it to the off side;
51.5;W;Peterson to Johnson, OUT another left-hander is bowled off the slog! Is this an epidemic or what? Peterson's lapping it up, tossed up on middle and it didn't turn, held its line and hit the middle stump, Johnson holds the pose on his knees, head bowed, Australia nine down;Mitchell Johnson b Peterson 7 (29m 22b 0x4 0x6) SR: 31.81;

49.1;?;Peterson to Hastings, no run tossed up and he tucks it to the on side;

48.5;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run Appeal for a caught behind and the umpire shakes his head and South Africa are reviewing it, it was short and wide outside off and Johnson tried to smash that over backward point, they all went up because they thought they heard a sound, there was no deviation so it only could have been a thin edge, Hot Spot didn't pick up anything so Johnson's safe, there was nothing to convince anyone that he edged it anyway, the right decision;

15.2;W;Philander to Ponting, OUT Appeal for an LBW and he's been given! But Ponting's reviewing it. And Ponting loses out on the review because the third umpire is convinced that was hitting. Here's how it happened - Ponting was well across his stumps to defend, the ball swung in and hit him just below the top flap of the front pad, looked like hitting middle, there was a doubt if it swung too much and would miss leg, but Ponting was a bit too far across and you could see the leg stump after the final shuffle;Ricky Ponting lbw b Philander 4 (17m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;

It was a loose drive outside off, slightly wide, Warner couldn't resist, de Villiers and the rest went up, Warner hesitated for a while and then reviewed after consulting Lyon, there was a noise, this is taking a while I'm afraid, and he has to walk alright;David Warner c ?de Villiers b Steyn 13 (58m 35b 2x4 0x6) SR: 37.14;

 Innings Start
4.50pm That's it. Australia are set 632 to win. This is the last time Ponting is leaving a Test field as a fielder. It's quite possible he might need to decide tonight if he wants a nightwatchman. That will be cruel, but is possible. Fourteen overs to face today. And these guys, who have been peppered by bouncers, will be all fired up
Andy Zaltzman, the sultan of stats, tweets immediately that this is only the third time since 1909 that all 10 wickets have been taken by left-arm bowlers. Perhaps this is what Smith was waiting for
And now I have found another great stat. Only the third time in the history of Test cricket that all 10 wickets have fallen to the same first name, after those two pals of mine, Jim and Anil

88.5;W;Johnson to Elgar, OUT well bowled Johnson. Pair for Elgar. A pear-shaped debut. Johnson has peppered him with bouncers and has now slipped in the length ball. Elgar is caught on the crease, and deeper still, playing across the line, hit on the knee roll, in front of middle. That ball pitched middle, swung away, and would have hit off. Elgar even reviewed it, in hope, but to no avail;Dean Elgar lbw b Johnson 0 (4m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
88.4;?;Johnson to Elgar, no run Oh ho ho ho. Another searing bouncer from Johnson. Elgar looking out of his depth. Hits the arm on the way to Wade. Australia appeal for the wicket, but the umpire calls it right;

88.1;W;Johnson to Amla, OUT What a way to go. Mitchell Johnson seems like taking all the catches in this innings. The WACA will rise for Amla, who has missed a double by four runs. Not a bum on seat or grass banks. Lovely applause for him. This is a length ball, on middle and leg, he tries to drive it down the ground, but fails to keep it down. It does seem to have stopped a touch on him. Johnson sticks out his right hand in the follow-through, and plucks this;Hashim Amla c & b Johnson 196 (350m 221b 21x4 0x6) SR: 88.68;

"guys, to distract you from your grieving, watch the next few overs very closely. I'll be wearing a green and gold wig, and will rush onto the ground. stay tuned for some light entertainment." Sumal Fernando, I hope you earn good money There's a hefty fine awaiting you
 Innings Start
Unfortunately there is no television coverage of the presentation. At least not here. We can confirm that Hashim Amla is the Man of the Match. Michael Clarke is the Man of the Series.
Trawling through twitter, here are some quotes:
Smith: "The guys showed tremendous character in the last two weeks. For us to achieve two series wins is a huge achievement for us. I just want to say to our fans back home, I know you've been waking up early in the morning to watch us. This one's for you."
Clarke: "They are the number one team in the world and have shown throughout this series why they are."
Amla: "I'm glad to have made a contribution. This year has gone well..."
Ricky Ponting, on the guard of honour: "It was an amazing gesture by Graeme and the team, thank you for that."
AB de Villiers tweets: "Now that was very sweet! Hard work paid off. Congrats to Ricky for an amazing career! Inspired me and so many others around the world!"
That's it from us here. Too bad there was no proper coverage of the presentation for most of the viewers around the world.
Thanks for joining us. Thanks for the mails. We'll see you soon. Australia's next assignment is the home Tests against Sri Lanka. South Africa host New Zealand. Cheers!
End of the match: South Africa have beaten Australia at home in consecutive series. Quite phenominal and it;s been quite an incredible series, with only one outright result out of three. Australia were all over the place on the first day at the Gabba but hit back and were the more dominant team through the game. Faf du Plessis played the innings of his life at Adelaide to save what seemed like a certain defeat for South Africa. At Perth, the No.1 Test side was far too good for Australia.
Unfortunately we have lost live pictures but we will try and get you the presentation.
Vikram: "Big fan of RSA cricket, Have endured all the tough times following them,World cup losses..But this is a time to Rejoice..Rankings don't matter to me but series victory in Australia is special..I think they need to strengthen their bowling bench strength if they want to dominate test cricket in the coming years..Kudos Guys..Awesome Job.."
