Data
6.35pm A quick turnaround. Mark Wood to bowl. Finch and Warner.
6.20pm: Lummy, what a finish that was! England added 102 from the last ten overs, Buttler and Woakes batting together throughout as all of the hard work put in by Australia's attack in the first four-fifths of the innings was undermined... Buttler went to his fifty from 52 balls in the 41st over, and only needed another 31 to double up. We know he's capable of that sort of thing but, on a pitch where most batsmen had struggled to score freely, that was stupefyingly good batting. I said England would probably be aiming for 300, regardless of conditions, but for a long while it looked as if 260-70 would be a good score. How much will Buttler's assault deflate Australia? They need 303 to prevent England from going 3-0 up and taking the series... This could be a doozy. Nikhil will be back for the start of the chase shortly
49.6;2;Starc to Buttler, 2 runs goes full and straight, Buttler can't really get under the ball but he forces it past midwicket... they are coming back for two, Buttler raises his century from the last ball of the innnings! He leaps in jubilation as he completes the second, helmet off to salute the crowd! This has been a brilliant one-day innings from Buttler, his fifth hundred and one to savour;
49.5;1;Starc to Woakes, 1 run yes, he will, Woakes digs out a yorker towards backward point, England raise 300 and Buttler gets his chance;
49.4;6;Starc to Woakes, SIX runs banged in... and clobbered over the rope at deep backward square! Top-edged on the pull but there was no one out there and the six brings Woakes his fifty!;
49.3;4;Starc to Woakes, FOUR runs Woakes gets this away, superbly placed, just a flick of the wrists and it's into the gap at cow corner!;
49.2;1;Starc to Buttler, 1 run full on the stumps, clipped to midwicket;
49.1;?;Starc to Buttler, no run full and straight, goes for the reverse sweep... Australia appeal for lbw, and up goes Chris Gaffaney's finger! Buttler reviews straight away, however, and it looks like he hit it. Yes, quite a clear edge, then on to the front pad;
48.6;4;Cummins to Woakes, FOUR runs and Woakes manages to skim it fine for four more! Cummins' figures take a beating, he strayed down the leg side and it skipped away from Paine for another boundary;
48.6;2nb;Cummins to Buttler, (no ball) 1 run full toss from Cummins, flubbed into the leg side... but it's a no-ball on height!;

48.2;?;Cummins to Buttler, no run short ball, Buttler wants to ramp it but only toe-ends wide of the keeper... and there's a mix-up in the middle, both batsmen at the same end briefly, but Paine is unlucky in that his throw hits Buttler diving for his ground and it deflects to safety as Woakes scuttles back;
48.1;1;Cummins to Woakes, 1 run length ball, Woakes clears the front leg but hammers a pull to deep midwicket;
47.6;?;Starc to Buttler, no run good riposte, speared full outside leg stump as Buttler backs away and fails to connect;
47.5;4;Starc to Buttler, FOUR runs oh, shot - the topspin forehand down the ground! Not quite the yorker and somehow Buttler gets under it and smashes four over mid-off with those graphite wrists!;
47.4;4;Starc to Buttler, FOUR runs another slower bouncer but Buttler connects with this one, boomed on the pull through square leg and the sweeper can't get to it despite a full-length dive;
47.3;?;Starc to Buttler, no run short, taking the pace off cleverly again, Buttler can't connect;
47.2;2;Starc to Buttler, 2 runs dropped! Starc follows Buttler as he makes room, scooped off a length straight down the ground towards long-on... but Zampa grasses a difficult chance running in!;

46.1;6;Cummins to Woakes, SIX runs short ball, slugged over the ropes at deep square leg! Woakes connects with a meaty pull and it sails for six, bringing up the England 250 in the process;
45.6;6;Hazlewood to Buttler, SIX runs maximum pain exacted moments later, Buttler creaming a flat six over long-off! The beast raises an eyebrow and bares its teeth;
45.5;?;Hazlewood to Buttler, no run shortish, deflected behind point via bat and pad, Woakes wanted it this time but Buttler wasn't coming... and Smith misses with a straightforward shy at the non-striker's end!;

43.5;1;Hazlewood to Buttler, 1 run Buttler does a little two-step at the crease, Hazlewood isn't falling for it, hits a length and he can only punch another single through point;

38.1;W;Marsh to Ali, OUT bowled him, Moeen drags on! He'll have to drag himself off, it's not been a fun tour with the bat for him... Back of a length, this time the ugly swipe goes down, rather than up, and raps the top of off stump - no chance for a fielder to mess things up and Marsh has a wicket;Moeen Ali b Marsh 6 (12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;

36.2;1;Marsh to Buttler, 1 run;
36.1;1;Marsh to Ali, 1 run dropped! A howler from Cameron White! Moeen gets a life, top-edging an ungainly heave straight up, should be a regulation catch at cover... but it goes right through him, a bar of soap in the showers, didn't get a hand on it - very similar to Hazlewood in the SCG Test, actually - and Moeen survives!;
35.6;1;Cummins to Ali, 1 run round the wicket, pitched full and Moeen wafts a drive, gets an inside edge for one past his pads;
35.5;1;Cummins to Buttler, 1 run comes across and dinks one into a gap;

Used the angle across Morgan, who played pretty well but is still searching for a major contribution;Eoin Morgan c ?Paine b Hazlewood 41 (50b 2x4 1x6) SR: 82;
34.5;1;Hazlewood to Buttler, 1 run good length in the channel, 135kph and Buttler just runs it off the face to third man;
34.4;2;Hazlewood to Buttler, 2 runs fuller, makes a bit of room to swing the blade, thick-edged behind his legs but they come haring back for two;
34.3;4;Hazlewood to Buttler, FOUR runs Buttler advances, the ball is short in response and he's waiting in position to swing a pull away through backward square, a welcome boundary for England;
34.2;?;Hazlewood to Buttler, no run angled in on off, 135kph and Buttler defends towards mid-on;
34.1;1;Hazlewood to Morgan, 1 run full, maybe a cutter on leg stump, Morgan made a little room and punches straight back past the stumps for one;
33.6;?;Cummins to Buttler, no run good length outside off, this touches 145kph/90mph and Buttler can only steer it straight to backward point;

32.5;?;Hazlewood to Morgan, no run banged in, slightly short and wide, Morgan swats a cut off the toe of the bat, rolls to cover;
32.4;?;Hazlewood to Morgan, no run good length, 125kph on off, taking the pace off and Morgan tinkles a straight drive fine of mid-off, decides not to take on the quick single;

30.5;1;Starc to Morgan, 1 run a low full toss around off, driven to the sweeper cover. Not quite found his consistency, but that isn't entirely unexpected with Starc's pace;
30.4;2;Starc to Morgan, 2 runs goes full, 141 kph, around off, driven to deep cover for a couple. Opened the bat face late to find the gap;

26.6;1;Zampa to Morgan, 1 run dropped by Steven Smith. Not easy but Smith will be disappointed. Short on middle and leg, pushed through. Slides on. Pulled to midwicket, where Smith gets low to his left, the ball pops out possibly off the wrists. Big moment in the game;

23.6;?;Starc to Morgan, no run short around off, 142 kph, gets on top of the bounce so easily to bunt it away. Have to use the bouncer sparingly and to earn yourself a dot on a surface like this, the fuller ones are the wicket-takers;
23.5;?;Starc to Morgan, no run seams back in, 143 kph, on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket.;
23.4;?;Starc to Morgan, no run 141 kph, short delivery, clever change in length, well directed too, Morgan sways away;

23.2;?;Starc to Morgan, no run good length delivery around off, defended watchfully;
23.1;1;Starc to Buttler, 1 run full delivery outside off from around the wicket, hit to deep cover. Looking for that off stump, or the one that got Buttler at the Gabba;

22.5;?;Hazlewood to Buttler, no run full delivery outside off, defended into the point region.;

22.3;?;Hazlewood to Buttler, no run another indicator of how slow this surface is, 141 kph outside off, hardly gets up, Buttler sways;
22.2;W;Hazlewood to Root, OUT 135 kph, the first today but may not be the last. Root chops on. Was just saying Root is so good at finding gaps, and his natural instinct of trying to do so kicks in. It's a good length delivery outside off that seams back in, with Hazlewood's natural angle. The safer shot would have been playing with a full face, but Root tries to cut this down to third man for a run. It's not wide enough for that, but he still may have got away with it on a quicker surface, but not this. Hits off stump and England now in trouble. Batsmen will have to get forward and play with the full face.;Joe Root b Hazlewood 27 (31b 1x4 0x6) SR: 87.09;
22.1;?;Hazlewood to Root, no run 136 kph, full delivery outside off, driven to short cover. A hint of inward movement;
21.6;?;Starc to Morgan, no run 124 kph, the slower bouncer or the ball just didn't travel after pitching? On middle and leg, the short delivery. Morgan watches it onto his bat, always wanted to play Starc out;
21.5;?;Starc to Morgan, no run wow, terrific yorker. On middle and leg, tailing back in ever so late. Morgan gets his bat down on it just in time and jams it out;
21.4;?;Starc to Morgan, no run 141 kph, full on off, Morgan watches the ball onto his bat and defends. They'll look at playing Starc out;
21.3;?;Starc to Morgan, no run full and straight again, off the inside half to midwicket;
21.2;?;Starc to Morgan, no run will go down as a drop but those ones either stick or they go through like this. Full and straight, Morgan drives back, can't keep it down. Starc sticks out a right hand, but the ball bursts through. Don't think he got a hand on it actually;
21.1;1;Starc to Root, 1 run full and wide outside off, carved away to the sweeper cover off the open face. So adept at finding gaps;
20.6;?;Zampa to Morgan, no run good end, slow but not full, 89 kph, Morgan gets forward and defends;
20.5;?;Zampa to Morgan, no run shortish and wide, 88 kph, wary of the reverse-sweep again, hit to backward point;
20.4;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run some drift on middle and leg, driven to long-on;
20.3;3;Zampa to Morgan, 3 runs did he get some bat? Don't think so, but runs given. Lots of flight outside off, attempts another reverse-sweep but it's too full outside off. Paine is put off by that shot, goes through his legs;
20.2;4;Zampa to Morgan, FOUR runs that's how Morgan plays, he backs a very productive shot and connects. Flat and straight, Morgan gets into a really good position and reverse-sweeps through backward point. Out if he missed, but it's a very safe shot for Morgan;
20.1;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run too much flight, on middle and leg, driven to long-on;
19.6;2;Starc to Morgan, 2 runs full and wide outside off, neatly played this time, through cover for a couple. Played inside the line to account for that movement;
19.5;?;Starc to Morgan, no run wow, probably what Australia were playing for, 141 kph outside off, gets the ball to jag back in. It takes the inside edge, hits the back pad and smells the paint of leg stump. An inch straighter and the leg bail would have fallen;
19.4;?;Starc to Morgan, no run 140 kph, wide and full, sliced to the point fielder. Is there some reverse swing? You tend to get reverse quicker on an abrasive surface;
19.3;4;Starc to Morgan, FOUR runs don't think Starc will mind that too much, there is some late inward movement. Full and straight, maybe a tad too straight. Morgan just tickles that fine, to the fine leg boundary;
19.2;1;Starc to Root, 1 run full and wide outside off, driven elegantly to the sweeper cover;
19.1;?;Starc to Root, no run a full delivery outside off, dabbed towards backward point. Steven Smith picks up and throws at the bowler's end. Hits Morgan's bat, to the angst of the umpire. Could be to scruff up the ball.;
18.6;?;Zampa to Morgan, no run another googly, 82 kph, outside off, not much turn, defended back. Excellent length for a wristspinner in that over, rather be full than short for precisely that reason;
18.5;W;Zampa to Bairstow, OUT oh beautifully bowled. The previous one was the legbreak, this one was the googly. They both were really full, the length allowed Bairstow to throw his hands at the line without his feet. What that did was create a big gap between bat and pad, the legbreak found the middle of the bat, the googly found a massive gap between bat and pad, and hits off and middle stump. Sensational bowling, didn't shorten his length after he was hit.;Jonny Bairstow b Zampa 39 (57b 2x4 0x6) SR: 68.42;
18.4;4;Zampa to Bairstow, FOUR runs lovely shot, some flight outside off, so much flight that Bairstow chooses not to move his feet and then lofts the ball neatly over cover. Didn't bother keeping it down;
18.3;?;Zampa to Bairstow, no run driven into the cover region;
18.2;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run;
18.1;?;Zampa to Root, no run was there some bat? 82 kph, very full outside off, Root shuffles right across and sweeps to short fine leg. Steven Smith speaks to Zampa, who is conversing with Paine. They rightly decide against the review;
17.6;?;Marsh to Bairstow, no run excellent finish, that's where you want to be on this surface. Full and straight, defended back. A tidy over;
17.5;?;Marsh to Bairstow, no run short and wide outside off, Bairstow nails a cut but finds the impenetrable Steven Smith at backward point, who dives to his right to save two, maybe four;
17.4;?;Marsh to Bairstow, no run full delivery outside off, driven into the cover region;
17.3;1;Marsh to Root, 1 run good length outside off, Root comes down and inside-halves the ball into his back thigh. Goes through his legs for a run. Ouch, could have been worse;
17.2;3;Marsh to Bairstow, 3 runs in the air and juuust wide of midwicket. Fullish on middle, Bairstow clips the ball in the air, but just wide of the fielder, to his right;
17.1;1;Marsh to Root, 1 run another good single. Full delivery, moving back in ever so slightly, patted away towards the keeper. Bairstow calls his partner through. Paine's soccer skill isn't the best, by the look of that attempt;
16.6;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run full outside off, carved to the sweeper cover with the full face of the bat.;
16.5;?;Zampa to Root, no run more drift, full and straight, hit back to the bowler;
16.4;4;Zampa to Root, FOUR runs excellent batting, learnt from his error off the first ball, knew midwicket was straight and square leg was wide so when he saw a short ball, he went back and swatted it over where a normal midwicket would have been;
16.3;1;Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run shortish and wide outside off, carved to deep point.;
16.2;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run nicely bowled, full on middle and leg, some drift in the air, worked away to deep square leg;
16.1;?;Zampa to Root, no run doesn't matter if you're bowling full tosses, Root swats it away to a straight midwicket;
15.6;2;Stoinis to Bairstow, 2 runs there is that dab to third man, gets two actually, fantastic running. On a length outside off, allows the ball to hit the bat, rather than going after it.;
15.5;1;Stoinis to Root, 1 run full and a tad wide, allows Root to stride forward and punch to the sweeper cover for a run;
15.4;1;Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 run on the pads this time, 136.5 kph, flicked away to deep square leg;
15.3;?;Stoinis to Bairstow, no run looking to glide that off the open face to third man but the ball came back in - not sure seam movement or an offcutter. Dabbed to point instead. Three dots;
15.2;?;Stoinis to Bairstow, no run nice wicket to wicket bowling, full around off, hit back to the bowler;
15.1;?;Stoinis to Bairstow, no run good length outside off, 131 kph, pushed to cover. Can't seem to force that through extra cover because of that lack of pace;
14.6;1;Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run tossed up nice and slow, draws a false shot as YJB reaches out and thick-edges one through backward square leg;
14.5;?;Zampa to Bairstow, no run flighted, Bairstow tries to heave down the ground and completely mistimes it to mid-on;
14.4;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run looped up, Root is down early to reverse-paddle one past short third man, Warner scampers after it to keep them to one;
14.3;1;Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run dragged down a little and this is played square off the back foot for one through point;
14.2;?;Zampa to Bairstow, no run pushed through and YJB dabs a drive to cover;
14.1;?;Zampa to Bairstow, no run tossed up and straightening outside off, defended on the back foot;
13.6;2;Stoinis to Root, 2 runs fullish, uses the feet and dabs a drive through point, into an unguarded part of the field and they hurry back for two;
13.5;?;Stoinis to Root, no run trundles in, wicket-to-wicket stuff and again the batsman works to the man at midwicket;
13.4;?;Stoinis to Root, no run attacking the stumps, Root can only nudge to midwicket;
13.3;1;Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 run full, 133kph outside off, Bairstow crunches a drive to the cover sweeper;
13.2;?;Stoinis to Bairstow, no run length, outside off, pushed back to the bowler;
13.1;1;Stoinis to Root, 1 run angled in and worked away through square leg for one;
12.6;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run looped up full, Root plays straight and tickles one more down the ground to long-off;
12.5;1;Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run pushed through outside off, punched past cover again;
12.4;?;Zampa to Bairstow, no run rolls his arm over, full outside off and driven into the ground, Paine appeals for the caught-and-bowled - but that was clearly a bump ball;
12.3;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run floated up and punched through the off side as he reaches out for it;
12.2;1;Zampa to Bairstow, 1 run full outside off, Bairstow swipes a drive out to the cover sweeper;
12.1;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run loops up the legbreak from over the wicket, pitching middle and leg, eased down the ground to long-on;
11.6;?;Stoinis to Bairstow, no run length in the channel, dabbed down behind square;
11.5;2;Stoinis to Bairstow, 2 runs dug in short, Bairstow rattles a pull through backward square, Cummins again surfs the wave along the boundary and one-hands it back in for deep square to field. [Jazz voice] Nice;
11.4;?;Stoinis to Bairstow, no run pitched up and pushed into the off side;
11.3;3;Stoinis to Root, 3 runs length, driven on the up and that's all business from Root, timed through the covers and Warner has to pump the gas to catch up with the ball just in front of the rope;
11.2;1;Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 run short and wide and rasped on the cut, Smith was pretty close at backward point but gets a good hand on it and keeps them to one;
11.1;?;Stoinis to Bairstow, no run length ball, 130kph outside off but it stays a bit low as YJB swats at it and misses;
10.6;?;Cummins to Root, no run comes across on off and defends;
10.5;1;Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run slower delivery, maybe a cutter from Cummins and Bairstow watches it on to the bat and works square;
10.4;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run angled in and turned short towards midwicket;
10.3;1;Cummins to Root, 1 run pitched up, 142kph and Root drives, eased past cover but mid-off does well to cut it off on the dive;
10.2;?;Cummins to Root, no run good length outside off, Root shoulders arms coming across;
10.2;1w;Cummins to Root, 1 wide short ball, cross-seamer but it's down the leg side, Cummins appeals as Root pulls at it... but Fry immediately signals wide;
10.1;1;Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run fullish and worked away off the legs for one;

"You talk about Australia losing 9 out of last 10 matches, Australia never played with their full strength in those 10 matches, containing Starc, Hazlewood, Cummins, Warner, Smith, Maxwell" I think in the case of Maxwell, the selectors have decided he isn't in their best XI, Vijay - hence not being picked for this squad. Though I would probably differ on that
 Innings Start
10.30pm: That is a wrap, folks. Mel Farrell's report will tell the story of an all-round performance that clinched things for England; they're on a roll, though Australia can of course console themselves by gazing at the urn. How long until England propose making the Ashes points-based across all formats, I wonder? Anyway, thanks for your comments, as ever - we'll be back for for on Friday. From Nikhil and myself, cheerio for now!
10.15pm: Thanks Nikhil, that was coolly done at the death. Time for the presentations, England now 3-0 up of course. Australia's captain Steve Smith is first up: "Yeah, disappointing tonight, I thought the way we bowled in the first 45 overs was good, but Jos played exceptionally well, Woakesy too, but we bowled poorly at the end, can't do that to a guy like Jos. We were chasing prob 30 too many, batted well but not enough to get over the line. [Dismissal?] It got given out, so I had to get off the field, wasn't hitting it very well anyway, gave some other guys a chance and they almost got us home. [Stoinis?] He's a powerful guy, a real positive. Our one-day cricket hasn't been up to scratch, we've got to find ways to win against quality opposition. [Adelaide for Australia Day, then new stadium in Perth] Two great days, hopefully two great occasions - hopefully the crowds turn up and we can put on a show."
Jos Buttler is unsurprisingly Man of the Match: "Great win, probably the best we've had. Had to find a bowler, Root bowling Liam Plunkett's overs, guys kept putting in performances. We've championed this way of playing, even if you lose wickets. Chris and I tried to push on, we were looking at 270 but we had a couple of good overs. [Innings?] Against Cummins, Starc, etc it was very special."
England captain Eoin Morgan: "So proud of the guys today, Jos was probably the the difference between the sides. On a two-paced wicket, he paced it to perfection, played the anchor until about five or six overs out. We thought 300 was competitive, to have a hammer blow with one of the quicks going down hurt us a lot actually. This is one of the best wins from this group. With our bowling efforts, everybody was required to give a bit extra and everyone did. With the ball we were outstanding. [Rest of series?] Hopefully two more wins, we're going to play our strongest possible XI."
10.08pm This England ODI juggernaut continues to roll. They have got to be one of the best in the world currently. They have beaten a strong Australia team thrice in succession away from home. And three convincing wins. The series is done. The Tests and the ODIs one-sided, but dominated by different teams.
The game, on a tricky SCG pitch, was set up by the belligerence of Jos Buttler, who smashed another terrific hundred. The England bowling was disciplined and accurate, and they did what they had to in the end overs to prevent an in-form middle order from doing too much damage. An iffy moment with Steven Smith's dismissal, but England thorough and clinical again.
49.6;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run a slower ball on off, swatted to deep square leg and England win the ODI series. Wide smiles on England's faces, Buttler knows the quality and the significance of the innings he played!;
49.5;1;Woakes to Cummins, 1 run a short and wide delivery, slashed to deep point;
49.4;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run there it is, a wide yorker creeps under Cummins' bat. Buttler is pumped. What an innings he played;
49.3;W;Woakes to Stoinis, OUT and taken at deep square leg. This game's gone. A short delivery on middle and leg, the slower bouncer, forcing a tiring Stoinis to generate his own pace. He is too tired, all he can do is pull the ball to deep square leg. Billings runs in and takes a good, low catch.;Marcus Stoinis c sub (SW Billings) b Woakes 56 (43b 3x4 2x6) SR: 130.23;
49.2;2;Woakes to Stoinis, 2 runs a nice full, wide yorker outside off, jammed out to long-on. Bad enough timing to come back for two;
49.1;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run a slower ball on leg, heaved to long-on. They opt to stick with one. Stoinis wants the strike.;
48.6;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run full and wide outside off, beautifully drilled but straight to the sweeper cover. Fantastic end from Wood.;
48.5;?;Wood to Paine, no run a DOT BALL! Valuable. Silence at the SCG. Short delivery on middle and leg, beats Paine's pull.;
48.4;1;Wood to Stoinis, 1 run good length on middle and leg, heaved away to deep square leg. Just the one.;
48.3;4;Wood to Stoinis, FOUR runs there's four. Full and wide outside off, Stoinis reaches out for the ball and guides the ball into the gap between point and third man for four. Fifty for Stoinis;
48.2;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run a slower delivery outside off, under-edged towards the keeper. Stoinis steals the strike with a good call;
48.1;1;Wood to Stoinis, 1 run good length on middle and leg, slashed to backward point.;
47.6;2;Woakes to Paine, 2 runs a low full toss around middle, hit over the bowler for a couple more. Root at mid-off, runs to his right, but can't stop two.;
47.5;1;Woakes to Stoinis, 1 run full and wide, was there to slice backward of point, but he can only mis-time a drive to the sweeper cover;
47.4;2;Woakes to Stoinis, 2 runs a clever short slower ball around off, swatted away to long-on, two more. Good running;
47.3;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run full delivery around off, Paine nails a drive on the bounce to Root at mid-off. A boundary a few yards either side;
47.2;1;Woakes to Stoinis, 1 run a slower ball outside off, 122 kph, hit to cover for a run with bad timing.;
47.1;6;Woakes to Stoinis, SIX runs another fine start to the over, a good length delivery on middle and leg. Stoinis shuffles across, bends his knees, stays low and whips a flick into the gap behind square. His muscular power takes it over the boundary;
46.6;1;Rashid to Stoinis, 1 run Stoinis charges, gets close, too close, unable to get underneath the ball, can only hit the ball to long-off. Another excellent comeback from a bowler who was hit for a boundary off his first ball;
46.5;2;Rashid to Stoinis, 2 runs this is really good bowling, sees Stoinis coming and shortens the length. Stoinis can only bunt the ball towards long-on with middling timing, which allows Paine enough time to come back;
46.4;1;Rashid to Paine, 1 run quick outside off, chipped away towards the sweeper cover. Just one;
46.3;2;Rashid to Paine, 2 runs more flight outside off, Paine stretches and fetches, a hard sweep to deep square leg for a brace;
46.2;1b;Rashid to Stoinis, 1 bye bye? Flight outside off, Stoinis misses a drive, the ball deflects off Buttler's gloves for one to third man;
46.1;4;Rashid to Stoinis, FOUR runs power! Rashid does not want to bowl full, he is short and a tad wide, Stoinis stays back and lofts the ball intentionally over cover. Terrific batting;
45.6;1;Wood to Stoinis, 1 run just eight off the over after four off the first ball, a slower ball on middle and leg, heaved to deep square leg;
45.5;?;Wood to Stoinis, no run and again, a full and wide yorker. Stoinis has backed away, looking to open up the off side but Wood is bowling it really wide so he can't reach it. The defensive bluff;
45.4;?;Wood to Stoinis, no run terrific bowling, good length but just inside the tramline. Boos from the crowd, but definitely inside the guideline, juuust inside but inside;
45.3;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run a short delivery on middle and leg, 141 kph, a top-edged pull towards the man at deep square leg;
45.2;1;Wood to Stoinis, 1 run good length around off, cut to deep point, one.;
45.1;4;Wood to Stoinis, FOUR runs swatted for four. A short, slower delivery outside off, pulled past mid-off, to his right. Stoinis has been in great hitting form, Australia need another big innings to keep this series alive;
44.6;?;Rashid to Paine, no run superb from Rashid, doesn't mind some flight on middle and leg, but does mind a full length, so the length is shorter, spins and beats the sweep. Awesome over;
44.5;1;Rashid to Stoinis, 1 run flat, quick and wide, driven to deep cover. Another fine over so far, can he finish well?;
44.4;1;Rashid to Paine, 1 run a googly down leg, 87 kph, pulled to deep square leg. Excellent defensive bowling;
44.3;2;Rashid to Paine, 2 runs short around off, Paine goes right back and pulls to deep midwicket;
44.2;1;Rashid to Stoinis, 1 run well bowled, sees Stoinis coming and Rashid shortens his length but slow outside off, Stoinis improvises a checked flick to midwicket. Good cricket;
44.1;1;Rashid to Paine, 1 run flat around off, 85 kph, swept to deep square leg;
43.6;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run a low full toss, 138 kph, driven to the sweeper cover for a run. Terrific over from Wood, executed pretty much what he wanted save a full toss earlier;
43.5;?;Wood to Paine, no run comes down, sees him coming and Wood shortens the length, on off, Paine is hurried through his pull, goes past;
43.4;1;Wood to Stoinis, 1 run good short ball, on middle and leg, a top-edged hook to fine leg. Nowhere near control;
43.3;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run another slower delivery around off, chopped away into the midwicket region, Wood chases, picks up, turns around and misses at the bowler's end.;
43.2;1;Wood to Stoinis, 1 run a low full toss outside off, badly-timed drive to cover;
43.1;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run a slower, wide delivery outside off, smashed to the sweeper cover for a run.;
42.6;1;Ali to Paine, 1 run full and wide outside off, carved to the sweeper cover;
42.5;?;Ali to Paine, no run well bowled, sees Paine backing away, fires a wide yorker, creeps underneath the bat;
42.4;4;Ali to Paine, FOUR runs in the gap for four. Flat down leg, Moeen follows Paine as he backs away, flicked with fierce power into the gap at square leg;
42.3;1;Ali to Stoinis, 1 run shortish and flat outside off, the batsman goes back and punches to the sweeper cover;
42.2;1;Ali to Paine, 1 run flat down leg, following Paine, driven to long-on again;
42.1;1;Ali to Stoinis, 1 run charges down and drives to long-on, got too close to the ball;

41.4;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run a low full toss, driven away to long-on;

40.6;1;Ali to Paine, 1 run full on middle and leg, driven to long-on;
40.5;?;Ali to Paine, no run looking for the big slog sweep, but Moeen has fired this in outside off, goes past the sweep;
40.4;?;Ali to Paine, no run short down leg, Paine misses a routine flick, struck on the thigh pad;
40.3;1;Ali to Stoinis, 1 run flight outside off, driven to long-on for one;
40.2;1;Ali to Paine, 1 run short down leg, pulled to deep midwicket for one.;

38.6;?;Rashid to Paine, no run 85 kph, slow outside off, pushed towards cover from the crease;
38.5;?;Rashid to Paine, no run lots of flight on that around off, driven back to the bowler;
38.4;?;Rashid to Paine, no run flat outside off, the legbreak, skews to point;
38.3;W;Rashid to Marsh, OUT taken at long-on. And Australia stumble further. This is a huge moment, the set man has picked out long-on. There have been so many dismissals where a batsman mistakes a flat legspinner for a long-hop. Happened to Guptill against Zampa at this ground, think it was last year. Marsh goes back and looks to pull over midwicket, but the ball lobs off the splice towards long-on. Flat trajectory from Rashid. No doubt about this one;Mitchell Marsh c Hales b Rashid 55 (66b 4x4 0x6) SR: 83.33;
38.2;1;Rashid to Stoinis, 1 run the googly on middle and leg, nudged to square leg;

37.5;1;Ali to Marsh, 1 run flight outside off, driven to long-off, 92 kph;

37.3;1;Ali to Marsh, 1 run keeps a tad low, flat around off, pushed away towards cover from the back foot. Almost crept underneath the bat;
37.2;?;Ali to Marsh, no run flat on middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler.;
37.1;1;Ali to Stoinis, 1 run flat down leg, worked to deep square leg;
36.6;1;Rashid to Stoinis, 1 run the googly, not sure he picked it, went back, his back pad right in front of off, but he got some bat on it and flicked to midwicket, read it off the pitch;
36.5;?;Rashid to Stoinis, no run the googly on middle, 85 kph, nudged to midwicket;
36.4;6;Rashid to Stoinis, SIX runs that's a confident shot. And runs give you confidence. Runs down to a good wristspinner early in his innings, backs his ability, gets to the pitch and drills a drive over mid-on. All the way;
36.3;1;Rashid to Marsh, 1 run slow through the air, 83 kph, on middle and off, some turn too, guided to point;
36.2;?;Rashid to Marsh, no run pushed through, quick on middle and leg, defended;
36.1;4;Rashid to Marsh, FOUR runs Marsh biffs another very powerful drive over cover for four to get to fifty. Another fine batting performance this summer;
35.6;1;Wood to Marsh, 1 run a slower ball outside off, 127 kph, dabbed down to third man off the open face.;
35.5;?;Wood to Marsh, no run good length and straight, nudged to midwicket.;
35.4;4;Wood to Marsh, FOUR runs fine shot. Bairstow on the sweeper cover boundary messes up, and the frustration of the crowd is vented on Bairstow. Slashed away with immense power, but it goes through Bairstow, who is a terrific fielder. Worsened by the time of day;
35.3;?;Wood to Marsh, no run full delivery outside off, 138 kph, seams back in, pushed to cover;
35.3;1w;Wood to Marsh, 1 wide dug in but too short, goes over the shoulder, 137 kph, wide.;
35.2;?;Wood to Marsh, no run 139 kph, full around off, coming back in, defended into the cover region;
35.1;2;Wood to Marsh, 2 runs short and wide outside off, an iffy start, slashed towards point, who gets a good hand on it. The sweeper cover cleans up;
34.6;2;Rashid to Stoinis, 2 runs lots of flight outside off, driven past cover for a couple. Long-off cleans up;
34.5;?;Rashid to Stoinis, no run pushed through, full around off, driven back to the bowler;
34.4;?;Rashid to Stoinis, no run quick on off and middle, pushed towards cover;
34.3;1;Rashid to Marsh, 1 run nice and slow around off and middle, dabbed towards short third man;
34.2;?;Rashid to Marsh, no run flight outside off, a thick outside edge down to third man.;
34.1;?;Rashid to Marsh, no run yorker around off, jammed away into the cover region;
33.6;W;Wood to Smith, OUT throws the hands, thick edge and Buttler snaffles a terrific low grab! Wood is delirious as he charges off...but Smith isn't walking. This is going to the TV umpire, and the soft signal is out, which could be crucial. Has he got fingertips under it? This is going to be incredibly tight, it's a fantastic effort from Buttler, but is there some grass involved? They are taking an age over the replays, but it's very hard to be definitive... And the third umpire has given it! The on-field call was key and Kumar Dharmasena has decided he can't overrule it. Smith is fuming, the crowd is silent but he has to go;Steven Smith c ?Buttler b Wood 45 (66b 1x4 0x6) SR: 68.18;

Finch immediately signals for a review, seeming to suggest he got some bat on it... but there's no bottom edge on the replays, and Hawk-Eye has it clipping leg stump! It was very close to sliding by but umpire's call is all England needed. Huge wicket, no hundred for Finch today!;Aaron Finch lbw b Rashid 62 (53b 3x4 3x6) SR: 116.98;

19.4;1;Root to Finch, 1 run darted in and Finch settles for nudging this away to the leg side;

19.1;1;Root to Smith, 1 run floated up and flicked in the air past square leg;
18.6;?;Rashid to Finch, no run goes up for lbw, this skidding on into the front pad as Finch went to sweep... outside the line, maybe? Or perhaps he got something on it, as England don't contemplate the review;

18.4;?;Rashid to Smith, no run tossed up and Smith cuts in front of square, he wants one but Finch is less keen and Woakes swoops to keep them honest;

16.2;?;Rashid to Smith, no run touch short, Smith throws the hands through a cut but sends it to point, he's disappointed with himself for missing out;

15.6;?;Root to Smith, no run pushed through, on middle and leg, nudged to square leg;

15.4;4;Root to Finch, FOUR runs whoopsy. On the pads, Finch works the ball over midwicket, a chip shot. Over midwicket. Woakes runs around from long-on, looking to flick the ball to the square leg fielder. But he over-runs it and allows the ball go to the boundary. Not a happy afternoon for him to come;

14.3;1;Ali to Smith, 1 run short on the pads, worked away to deep square leg;
14.2;1;Ali to Finch, 1 run what was Finch doing there? He should have ran two. Full outside off, Finch stays in his crease and mis-times a lofted drive over mid-off. Doesn't move for quite a bit, plonks over mid-off.;
14.1;3;Ali to Smith, 3 runs drifts on the pads, Smith just tickles him fine, aware that the fine leg fielder is very square. Three to fine leg;
13.6;?;Root to Finch, no run short down leg, Finch has backed away quite a bit, chopped to point;
13.5;1;Root to Smith, 1 run flicked away to deep midwicket. Some riskless runs;

13.1;1;Root to Smith, 1 run on the pads, nudged away to deep midwicket.;

10.4;6;Ali to Finch, SIX runs Ali keeps it on middle and leg, and that's right in Finch's wheelhouse, stays low and slog-sweeps the ball over midwicket for six. All power;
10.3;?;Ali to Finch, no run gives himself some room and slashes a cut to point;
10.2;1;Ali to Smith, 1 run slightly short around middle and leg, Smith goes back and punches to long-on from the back foot, a bit of tuen;
10.1;1;Ali to Finch, 1 run some flight outside off, driven away to long-on;

9.5;1;Plunkett to Finch, 1 run on the pads, nudged to deep square leg;
9.4;2;Plunkett to Finch, 2 runs nudged away behind square for a couple more. Just a bit straight there from Plunkett;

9.2;1;Plunkett to Smith, 1 run shortish delivery around off, Smith walks across and nudges to square leg for one;
9.1;1;Plunkett to Finch, 1 run full and wide outside off, a thick under-edge to third man. Wanted to go over mid-off. Left nothing in the tank;

8.5;?;Wood to Smith, no run driven to mid-on from the crease;
8.4;?;Wood to Smith, no run short and wide outside off, 145 kph, hit to point from the back foot;
8.3;W;Wood to White, OUT edged and gone! A start for White but he perishes looking to force the ball through point. May have been done in by some extra bounce. Back of a length delivery outside off, White looks to hit the ball through point but all he can get is a thin outside edge. Was actually looking quite solid on a tricky surface;Cameron White c ?Buttler b Wood 17 (25b 3x4 0x6) SR: 68;
8.2;?;Wood to White, no run full on middle and leg, 141 kph, pushed to midwicket;

7.6;?;Woakes to White, no run well bowled, 136 kph, full on middle and leg, but not overpitched. Skews off the outside half to cover;
7.5;1;Woakes to Finch, 1 run a slower delivery on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on for one. Good single, Billings the sub fielder there. Not sure who he is on for;
7.4;1;Woakes to White, 1 run 135 kph, on a length, down leg, nudged to deep square leg;
7.3;?;Woakes to White, no run good length outside off, chopped away to point;
7.2;4;Woakes to White, FOUR runs beautiful batting. Slightly overpitched from Woakes, White gets underneath the length early and lofts the ball over cover. A very T20 stroke, but works very well in ODIs too;
7.1;?;Woakes to White, no run back of a length outside off, 132 kph, came on slower than White expected, defended back;
6.6;?;Wood to Finch, no run nice end, 141 kph, tidy around off, defended back;
6.5;1;Wood to White, 1 run 142 kph, on middle and leg, worked away towards midwicket. A hand on it from the fielder takes some pace off the ball;
6.4;4;Wood to White, FOUR runs smashed! A half-volley outside off at 141 kph, but White creates even more power with an expansive drive through cover. Delectable;
6.3;?;Wood to White, no run 138 kph, full delivery outside off, the right length for this pitch, played defensively to point. White taking his time early;
6.2;?;Wood to White, no run goes fuller, 136 kph, White was early through his flick off the leading edge towards cover;

5.6;1;Woakes to White, 1 run a slower delivery outside off, 120 kph, tapped behind point with soft hands for a quality single. Well run;
5.5;?;Woakes to White, no run full outside off, driven into the cover region;
5.4;?;Woakes to White, no run this one bounces extra, 132 kph, good length on middle and leg, some extra climb hits the splice of the bat. Toe-end and now splice off consecutive balls, of very similar lengths. In fact, this one was marginally fuller than the previous one;
5.3;?;Woakes to White, no run full delivery outside off, may have kept a tad low, played away towards point;
5.2;4;Woakes to White, FOUR runs drifts on the pads and White picks him off through midwicket for three. Nicely played, just let the ball come to him before working the ball away. Hales picks up near the boundary, and throws the ball back but a shoe is in contact with the boundary.;
5.1;?;Woakes to White, no run good length delivery outside off, played into the point region from the crease;
4.6;1;Wood to White, 1 run shortish down leg, clipped into the leg side;
4.5;?;Wood to White, no run full delivery outside off, played to cover;
4.5;1w;Wood to White, 1 wide attempts it again, a bouncer outside off, but deemed too high for legality;
4.4;?;Wood to White, no run 142 kph, shortish again, think Wood is getting slightly carried away with that length. Not quite the surface to do this, short around off, pulled to square leg;
4.3;?;Wood to White, no run tidy channel, around off, blocked;
4.2;?;Wood to White, no run shortish outside off, punched off the back foot to point;
4.1;?;Wood to White, no run dug in, short around off, defended back. Wood sprawls over, head first into the surface. Lovely day to go head first into a deep pool, but an unpleasant experience on a cricket field;
3.6;1;Woakes to White, 1 run good length delivery on middle, a 138 kph, thick inside edge to fine leg;
3.5;W;Woakes to Warner, OUT tries to force the ball through cover, but his balance was terrible. And all he can do is chip his wicket away to extra cover. Was around full, on a length. Warner stayed back to a ball he should have been forward to. Instead of adjusting his shot, he goes through with what he wanted to play, a forceful punch from the back foot, but his balance (and therefore timing) are way off. Can only push it away. Woakes is pumped.;David Warner c Hales b Woakes 8 (10b 2x4 0x6) SR: 80;
3.4;1;Woakes to Finch, 1 run good length outside off, 136 kph, Finch opens the bat face and carves a glide to third man;
3.3;?;Woakes to Finch, no run pushes it slightly fuller outside off, seams back in and goes through Finch's cut. Through to the keeper;
3.2;4;Woakes to Finch, FOUR runs beautifully played. Slightly short, and he loves them there. Just swivels on a pull and finds the gap behind square for four.;
3.1;?;Woakes to Finch, no run good length delivery outside off, blocked back;
2.6;3;Wood to Finch, 3 runs lovely shot, back of a length outside off, Finch stays back and just punches a sliced push through cover point. Pulled inside just inside by a diving Morgan;
2.5;?;Wood to Finch, no run 146 kph, full delivery outside off, Finch stays back, should have been forward, toe-ended back up the pitch;
2.4;?;Wood to Finch, no run full, a yorker around off, jammed out to cover;
2.3;?;Wood to Finch, no run lovely channel, just around off, 145.4 kph, played to midwicket, that strong bottom hand was evident;
2.2;4lb;Wood to Finch, 4 leg byes poor delivery. Strays down leg, off the thigh pad and past the keeper. Four leg byes to fine leg. All free runs for Australia.;
2.1;?;Wood to Finch, no run good length on middle and leg, 142 kph, pushed towards midwicket;

Robbie Cameron: "Does the short innings break mean most players won't eat between 2pm and 10pm? Buttler, for example, wouldn't eat before he batted, didn't have time between innings, and will now keep for 50 overs! I understand it's due to Australia's poor over rate, but that's a bit tough on England's players!" C'est la vie. Although he would have preferred a hundred over high tea.
