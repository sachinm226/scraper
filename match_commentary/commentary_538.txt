South Africa will be reasonably happy with this recovery. The innings was shaped on a very chancy innings by van der Merwe which included a series of mishits which somehow found the boundary. Australia bowled a lot slower balls to fox the batsmen and overall it's been a good bowling effort. Join us shortly for the chase of 157.
19.6;6;Laughlin to Boucher, SIX runs he bowls it on the stumps and gets punished, he makes room and slogs him away, it's more of a flat six which just clears the deep midwicket rope;
19.5;?;Laughlin to Boucher, no run he slogs and misses it completely;
19.4;1;Laughlin to Morkel, 1 run gives him the charge and he cleverly bowls the slower ball wide of the offstump;

17.3;W;Harwood to van der Merwe, OUT he goes for 48, Harwood drops it short and van der Merwe makes room to slice it through the off side, the short length foxes him and he has no room to work with and as a result he gets a faint edge to Haddin;Roelof van der Merwe c ?Haddin b Harwood 48 (28m 30b 2x4 4x6) SR: 160;

1.2;2;Harwood to Gibbs, 2 runs he overpitches on the pads this time and Gibbs works it wide of midwicket with little effort, Warner does the chasing;
1.1;4;Harwood to Gibbs, FOUR runs poor start for Harwood and Gibbs obliges a half volley by getting forward and timing it sweetly past the covers, no need to chase that;

We're just moments away from the start. Peterson will open. A few Indian flags around. Steyn apparently has a groin injury.
Laughlin is a fast bowler from Queensland and will make his international debut for Australia. Abdulla, the left-arm seamer and van der Merwe, the left-arm spinner, will make their international debuts for South Africa. Fast bowler Louw has already played 3 ODIs and a Twenty20 for SA.
Toss Australia have won the toss and they will bowl first.
Team changes: Three changes for Australia. Brett Geeves, Mitchell Johnson and Michael Hussey make way for Ben Laughlin, Nathan Bracken and Callum Ferguson. We'll let you know about the South Africans shortly.
SA are experimenting like crazy. Yusuf Abdulla, Roelof van der Merwe and Johann Louw get a game.
South Africa: Johan Botha (capt), Robin Peterson, Herschelle Gibbs, AB de Villiers, Justin Ontong, JP Duminy, Mark Boucher, Johann Louw, Roelof van der Merwe, Albie Morkel, Yusuf Abdulla
Australia: Ricky Ponting (capt), Michael Clarke, Nathan Bracken, Callum Ferguson, Brad Haddin (wk), David Hussey, Ben Laughlin, Cameron White, David Warner, Shane Harwood, James Hopes.
So Steyn, Amla, Parnell and van Jaarsveld get a rest. Man to man, Australia look stronger and should start as favourites.
5.20pm local: Good evening/morning wherever you are and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the second and final Twenty20 international between South Africa and Australia. The action shifts to Centurion and the best Australia can do tonight is to square the series.
The toss is about ten minutes away and we'll try and get you the news as soon as possible. Alex Brown has the bulletin honours tonight and it's a very good evening to him as well.
 Innings Start
South Africa sweep the series 2-0 with this win. Australia were in control today in the first half of the match, and when Clarke and Warner gave them a brisk start. It was the South African spinners who transformed the game. Only 16 runs come in one four-over spell starting from the ninth.
Hamza Ansari from Pakistan: "This SA vs AUS series is turning out be a repitition of the series b/w played in Australia. Visiting side won the test 2-1 and home side won the T20 2-0"
At the presentation ceremony, Ponting says he's happy with the way the bowlers performed, but not with the batting.
Debutant van der Merwe is the Man of the Match. "It's not how you drive, but how you arrive," he says when asked about a couple of mishits which went for six.
Johan Botha says today's performance from a new-look side will give the selectors a bit of a headache ahead of the World Twenty20.
