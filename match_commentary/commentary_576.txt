Credit to Sri Lanka's bowlers who have done so well throughout, bowling so well as a unit and didn't let up in the field, although they couldn't quite connect with any of the direct hits. Hussey and Clarke are the only batsmen to emerge with any real credit, both striking what could be crucial fifties in a lowish run chase.
Here's Hussey's verdict: "It was hard work out there, two-paced and a slow pitch. I reckon we've got a total we can defend there, we've got a good chance."
Wow, a stat just in from Rajesh: "This is Australia's lowest 50-over total since May 22, 1997, when they scored 170 for 8 v England at Headingley. At home it's their lowest 50-over total in more than 14 years - they scored 172 for 9 in Sydney in December 1993." Now, before you write in, because I know what you're like - you keep us on our toes - this is obviously only in games in which they have batted the entire 50 overs.

1.5;?;Malinga to Hayden, no run not much bounce there, the ball ekeing on past the left hander;

0.1;?;Vaas to Gilchrist, no run starts well, landing on a good length and curving the ball away, Gilchrist shouldering arms;

2.15pm Out come the batsmen now, and the Sri Lanka team of course. The sky has cleared remarkably quickly, all of a sudden it is sunny and "looks quite ridiculous to have the floodlights on now" says Brydon who has a point. "Fifteen minutes ago it was so gloomy we couldn't have played without the lights."
Chaminda Vaas is ready to bowl now.
2.10pm "A very small crowd in at the moment, for the MCG," notes Brydon. "Sri Lankan supporters are just about outnumbering the Aus supporters at the moment, Melbourne has quite a Sri Lankan community."
2.00pm An indifferent forecast for the game today. Jayawardene explains his decision to bat second: "The conditions and it's been overcast for the last day or so. If it's a shortened game it could be to our advantage - it is always, you know exactly what you're chasing." A change for Sri Lanka - Dilruwan Perera comes in, Kapugedera is out. Perera will open the batting.
Ricky Ponting on the pitch: "They're mostly pretty slow in Melbourne. Chasing runs is always pretty difficult so I'm actually happy. We've got exactly the same team. Brett Lee's got another day off."
A smiling Ponting dismisses the money of the IPL (Improbable Paycheque League perhaps), joking that it doesn't matter whether he gets more runs than Symonds today. "It's his shout wherever we go." Then he adds: "I could end up being the bargain buy of the tournament, you never know." Time to stop smiling now, though, as some serious business is about to get underway. Don't go away.
The lights are already on can you believe.
1.20pm Sri Lanka have won the toss and sent Australia in. An interesting decision to chase under the lights.
1.00pm Hello everyone and you're very welcome along to coverage of the latest match in the CB Series, this time Australia are hosting Sri Lanka at the MCG. If Sri Lanka lose they're not definitely out, although Australia would guarantee themselves a finals place. But Mahela Jayawardene would feel a world more comfortable if his team could win.
"A bit of a gloomy day but no rain at the moment," reports Brydon Coverdale from the ground. Here's his preview of the game. Note that Brett lee is out once more, rested, and probably having a nice lie down to recover from being sold for $900,000 in the IPL auction. His $1million man of a team-mate, Andrew Symonds, should play though. But of course the players won't be thinking about such things today...
 Innings Start
10.10pm The game's off, the rain has worsened, so Australia, as expected, win by 24 runs on the D/L method, grab the bonus point and are through. Thanks for joining us today, come back on Sunday for the next round. Till then, it's goodbye from me.
9.50pm To confirm, Australia get a bonus point if there is no more play. Our Oracle reckons the cut-off is 10.20pm, so half an hour from now. Although I've heard rumours that it may be 10.30[m, nothing's official yet but about a million times less farcical than the World Cup final finish which is just playing across our screens.
"I don't fancy our chances of any more play," Brydon doommongers.
While we're waiting for more news, time for an ad break and here's something for a rainy day(-night). Get yourselves this, grab this and unfurl this one from your locker.
"Bit hard to transfer to the Dome," says Dave Bags. "A game of footy on there at the moment, with the mighty Bombers battling against the Bulldogs." But we've got all night.
9.45pm Channel Nine are now showing highlights of the World Cup final. The margin here's not that drastic.
9.35pm Regarding the cut-off time, patience my pretties. I'll tell you as soon as someone's told me. Crowd figures meanwhile, there were 27,854 here, which is low for Melbourne on a Friday. Easily half of those must now have left, though. Australia are on for the 24-run win.
9.30pm The covers are still on. "It's just a very misty rain," says Brydon, "but it's not looking great."
9.20pm Andrew McDougal has a solution: "How long would it take to shift all players, officals and fans from MCG to the Dome and vice versa? Shut down the city, get extra trams going and we can do this in one hour tops. Who's against this? Think of the publicity!" See you there.
9.15pm Kunal wants to know: "Why have there been so little boundaries in both innings? It just seems strange." A combination of a slowish pitch but mainly some very nagging bowling from both teams, which has been a feature of this series, not to mention there are a few batsmen struggling on both sides.
9.10pm "Forget the IPL, Gilly, come and play for Cowell" reads a sign. Or Port Adelaide. We're pretty handy, we've got the Australia captain, opening bowler and an England batsman... ah, that's us women. Nevermind.
Long-time reader Bob O'Hara pops up. "In the early days of D/L, it produced some strange targets, so it was pretty useless. I guess then it was known as Duck-Lewis. No?" No. We've had variants on those jokes, too, so 'thanks' to those who wrote in.
9.00pm Woo woo, those three little words every cricket fan is waiting to hear - covers coming off. Gah, but wait, Brydon reckons that's ambitious. "I wonder if the groundstaff have seen the radar, which indicates much heavier rain soon."
And in fact, the covers are being laid down again as we speak. Reminds me of that classic Fawlty Towers "It's up... it's down again" moment.
8.55pm C'mon, someone's gotta have a worse joke than Geoff. Just to clarifying, meanwhile, that if there's no resumption, Australia will win on D/L by 24 runs. Lots of fairweather fans have already deserted the G.
8.45pm Heavy drizzle and now the players come off, the groundstaff come on. Sri Lanka are 25 behind on D/L right now.
Geoff Black deserves to be outed for the poorest 'joke' ever. "Does this mean it's only a Worth-Lewis score seeing as Sri Lanka have a duck already?" Get off the stage.
