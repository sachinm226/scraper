So the homeside needs 274 to win -- please rejoin us for further coverage of this match in around about half an hours time.
Some issues with the weather at Eden Park as we have had some rain -- there will be a slight delay to the start of the NZ run chase. It seems we will start at 4.30pm NZ time a delay of about 15 minutes as they mop up the ground after a shower in the innings break.

5.4;?;Southee to Haddin, no run 141kph, Southee beats Haddin again, lovely bowling and Haddin's attempted drive doesn't connect;
5.3;?;Southee to Haddin, no run Haddin misses again, he's looking a little scratchy, tries to guide this one wide of the slips but there's more bounce than he expected;

3.1;?;Southee to Haddin, no run a bit of outswing from Southee, full and wide of off, Haddin tries for a drive but misses;
2.6;?;Bond to Watson, no run good line outside off, no swing though, and Watson angles the bat and defends towards gully;

2.4;?;Bond to Haddin, no run left alone outside off;

2.2;?;Bond to Watson, no run drives to extra cover;
2.1;?;Bond to Watson, no run full and wide of off at 143kph, Watson drives straight to cover, he'd be annoyed at not getting that one through the infield;

0.6;?;Bond to Watson, no run oh, nearly got him! Movement in again from Bond, and some bounce, Watson plays off the back foot and very nearly chops it back into his off stump, the ball bounces just wide of the stumps;
0.5;?;Bond to Watson, no run left alone outside off, Watson keen to have a bit of a look at Bond at this stage;
0.4;?;Bond to Watson, no run an lbw appeal here, the ball swings in and hits Watson in line, but high up on his thigh and definitely would have sailed over the top;
0.3;2;Bond to Watson, 2 runs Watson's off the mark with a clip through midwicket, although it wasn't timed, he was trying to drive that straighter;
0.2;?;Bond to Watson, no run lovely ball, that one swings in quite prodigiously and Watson goes for an off-drive, the ball sails between bat and pad;
0.1;?;Bond to Watson, no run left alone outside off at 140kph, no swing there for Bond;
0.1;1w;Bond to Watson, 1 wide and it's well wide of off stump, Billy Bowden calls it a wide and there's no doubt about that decision;

Welcome to Eden Park for the second ODI. Australia have won the toss and are batting first. No changes for the visitors, Daniel Vettori is back for Jacob Oram and Ross Taylor has missed out with a leg injury. Gareth Hopkins is in the side to keep and Brendon McCullum, who has a back problem, is batting only. Shane Bond to start.
 Innings Start
What a finish - full credit to the Aussies for getting over the line, another great game of 50 over cricket in the battle for the Chappell Hadlee trophy. Smart bowling in the end from Harris got the Aussies home when it looked like it was going to go the other way. Player of the match was Dan Vettori for his excellent bowling and bold batting - sadly his innovative batting was his undoing. Great to watch though.
These teams appear to be very well matched up and they will meet again on Tuesday at the lovely Seddon Park in Hamilton for the 3rd ODI. On behalf of the team this is Lawrie Colliver signing off - make sure you join us on Tuesday from Hamilton
