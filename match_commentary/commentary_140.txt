Data
10.29am Righto, we're ready to start. Michael Clarke believes India's 250 is worth probably 280-300 given the slow pitch and outfield. How many more can they add? We'll find out. Hazlewood to complete the over. Three slips waiting.
Note for the Indian bowlers from the big man:




10.23am In the aftermath of Australia's first home-Test day for the summer, Mitchell Starc revealed how he and the bowling coach David Saker had been working to rediscover the sort of swing and pace he showcased three years ago. Dan Brettig delves into the methods.
Sidharth Monga checks-in: "How hot is it in Adelaide? Well this is my fourth day of this Adelaide trip. Let's take out the jetlag day, and on the next morning I ran 5k in 30 minutes, and stopped feeling I had enough in the tank for two more kilometres. It was an overcast, pleasant morning, a day before the start of the Test. Since then, though, summer has properly kicked in. The sun was out early this morning, and I couldn't go beyond 3.3k. Good news for the players is that it has become overcast since then. We are expecting highs of 35 degrees today as opposed to 39 yesterday.
"That won't stop the flies, though. I think the Adelaide flies don't get their due because of the Perth ones. These are no less pesky or persistent. A think a family of five ran every bit of the 3.3ks with me. I feel like they are my friends now. I feel like they told me the stories of their lives in those 20 minutes. We share a bond. I will see them again tomorrow morning. Or maybe they have made it here to Adelaide Oval."
Mustafa Moudi asks: "After Katich's Departure, Aussies has tried Watson, Cowan, Hughes, Renshaw, Burns, Rogers, Warner, Khawaja, Finch as their openers. And today yet again they will have another opener in Harris. Why dont they jist name Finch and Khawaja as their permanent openers until Warner returns given Khawaja's excellent opening records."
10.05am How did new Australia fare on their return to Test cricket at home for the first time since the Newlands saga? Daniel Brettig with his appraisal.

Aashish Chandy: "Any idea which are the other 4 knocks he's talking about in his top 5? Cause yesterday's was unbelievable." -- The unbeaten 145 at Colombo as an opener and his Southampton century earlier this year figure, I'd imagine.
Day 2, 9.52am It's a warm welcome to all of you. India would've slept a lot better than they would've imagined, thanks to Che's commandments. India would've liked 350 ideally, but at 19 for 3, they wouldn't have imagined touching 250. That said, they'll still have to bowl really well to put Australia's inexperienced batting to test. The last-wicket pair of Shami and Jasprit Bumrah will swing their willow before that. One thing's for sure: Shami isn't the kind who will bat out overs, so he's going to go for it either way. So there's a chance India either pinch a quick 15-20 runs or get bowled out very early. Pujara believes the surface looks far difficult that it seems on TV.
87.6;W;Hazlewood to Shami, OUT would you believe it? He's gloved an absolute shocker of a short ball down leg to Paine. Asking to be hit, any bit of bat on that would've been enough to get a boundary. India bowled out for 250. Shami just doesn't know to put a price tag on his wicket.;Mohammed Shami c ?Paine b Hazlewood 6 (28m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 60;
87.5;W;Hazlewood to Pujara, OUT run out! Magnificent direct hit from Cummins. Incredible piece of fielding. Pujara pushed one wide of mid on and ran to try and retain the strike, Cummins moves to his right gathers and flings a side arm throw as he dives forward, has one stump to aim at and hits! Pujara caught just short. The end of a quality innings. Just about the only way they could get him;Cheteshwar Pujara run out (Cummins) 123 (376m 246b 7x4 2x6) SR: 50;

83.2;?;Hazlewood to Pujara, no run 132kph, back of a length on off stump, he defends off the back foot into the leg side;
83.1;?;Hazlewood to Pujara, no run 135kph, good length, fifth stump line outswinger, he leaves this alone;
82.6;?;Starc to Shami, no run 145kph, back of a length, he pushes with a vertical bat and no feet through the gap at point but they opt not to take any runs. They might have got two if they had run;
82.5;4;Starc to Shami, FOUR runs 148kph wide full toss and he just reaches out and slaps it through backward point! It raced away. Horrible delivery;
82.4;W;Starc to Sharma, OUT bowled him! Finally he gets it full and straight gets it through! It was a full missile, swinging late back in, it beat the bat, it came off the pads, and cannoned into off stump.

74.6;?;Lyon to Sharma, no run has he been strangulated down leg? Umpire Nigel Llong doesn't seem to think so and Australia review. Paine thinks he heard a tickle, Ishant not too perturbed. Nothing wrong with the frontfoot so that's fine. Now checking with snicko and it indicates absolutely nothing. Decision stays;

57.2;1;Lyon to Ashwin, 1 run suicidal run, but he survives. First there were shouts of catch as the ball nearly lobbed off a thick inside edge wide of short leg.

Cummins returns after drinks
 Innings Start
2.05pm The covers are coming off. The players are warming up.
Pushkar: "so what do you guys reckon is a good target for Australia to play for in Second innings? 250+? And whats the weather forecast for next 2 days?"
I think 250 plus would be a very tough chase. The weather looks good for Sunday and Monday but there is a chance there might be more rain this afternoon.
1.58pm Play is set to resume at 2.15pm. 61 overs left in the day now. Tea is scheduled for 4.25pm. Stumps will be at 7pm.
1.51pm Good news. The big covers are coming off. It looks like the rain has stopped. The umpires are out there having a discussion.
Aakash: "Looking at the radar, I estimate the gap between two rain patches is about 1.5 hours. Also, the later one looks more heavier than the current one." I'd agree with that. The pitch cover is still on. There is a very light drizzle still so they can't remove the cover yet. The outfield still has a fair amount of moisture on it. They'll need time to dry as much of that up as possible.
1.45pm We will not be starting at 1.52pm after lunch as the covers are still on the ground. A band of rain is still passing through Adelaide. There is some clear sky behind it but there is some more rain behind that. It could be a pretty frustrating afternoon.
Meanwhile, India face Canada at the Hockey World Cup tonight, looking to top their group. With a five-day gap since their last game and warnings in the form of upsets for Netherlands and Argentina, India must guard against complacency.
And in case you're wondering what David Warner's up to, he's just signed another T20 contract, this time in Bangladesh.
Simon B: "Unbelievable. Rain wasn't heavy enough for Australia to be given the chance to avoid losing wickets. Every little bit helps."
A little something on Shami:




By the way, did you know Rishabh Pant equalled MS Dhoni's record of six catches, the most for an Indian in a Test innings? Here's the records page for you to dig into, while I can dig into some steamed idlis and sambar.
1.21pm Play will resume at 1.52pm weather permitting.
1.10pm We may have to wait for a bit before India resume because it's drizzling and the covers are coming on. Wonder if there's now a case for the lunch break to be advanced. Tim Paine isn't happy with the decision to bring on the covers, he reckons it isn't heavy enough. And as I type, there's confirmation that they've taken lunch. Paine shakes his head and walks off to join his mates who were at the boundary edge, waiting to come in. Even as all this happens, Vijay is staying out in the rain to hit some underarm throwdowns
1.03pm India ahead, but by just 15 runs. Now, they'll have to weather a 20-minute burst before the lunch interval in overcast conditions. Not what Rahul will want, with the kind of form he's been in. There's hint of pressure on Vijay too as he makes a comeback. Can they see off possibly four or five overs? This game can turn very quickly if Australia strike twice early. It's on an absolute edge, boiling towards being a corker. Don't go anywhere.
India started the day needing to pick three quick strikes. Bumrah struck early before they went off for rain. Upon resumption, Lyon played his shots to whittle down the lead before Shami removed the last two wickets in his first over.
98.4;W;Shami to Hazlewood, OUT has a waft at that and is gone! Width on offer, he looks to punch on the up but is done in by the zip off the deck, late on the stroke and Hazlewood gets the thinnest of edges through to Pant. India have a slender lead.;Josh Hazlewood c ?Pant b Mohammed Shami 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
98.3;W;Shami to Head, OUT nicks and gone! Beauty of a delivery. Goes round the stumps, gets this length ball to angle in and straighten, Head is forced to play but the ball moves away a wee bit very late and he's squared up as he gets the edge through to Pant. End of a superb innings. A maiden Test ton isn't to be, but who knows, this could be worth much more. Only time will tell.;Travis Head c ?Pant b Mohammed Shami 72 (253m 167b 6x4 0x6) SR: 43.11;
98.2;1;Shami to Lyon, 1 run nips back in from length outside off, tucks to square leg as they zip across for a single.;
98.1;6;Shami to Lyon, SIX runs hooked out of the park for six. Clean strike, magnificent strike!

More frustration for Kohli;
97.6;1;Ashwin to Lyon, 1 run lunges forward and then opens the bat face slightly to steer this wide of slip.;
97.5;1;Ashwin to Head, 1 run steps out and works this with the angle to midwicket, a slight misfield means there's a single on offer and they take it;

97.3;?;Ashwin to Lyon, no run carrom-ball but the length is on the shorter side, defended back.;

94.1;?;Sharma to Head, no run back of length on the off-stump channel, left alone.;
93.6;?;Bumrah to Lyon, no run big appeal for lbw but the full delivery tailed back in a little too much and the point of impact may have been just outside leg, so would've gone further down. Okay, so replays confirm there was a bit of an inside edge onto the boot.;
93.5;?;Bumrah to Lyon, no run punches this incoming full delivery to mid-on.;
93.5;1w;Bumrah to Lyon, 1 wide ducks under this short ball that sails way over Lyon's head.;

92.2;1;Sharma to Head, 1 run attacks the stumps with a length ball on middle and leg, tucked to square leg.;

It hit the back leg outside the line but no shot means it still can be out. Ball tracking says ... hitting. Out!
