 Innings Start
Australians have won the match convincingly and with that they have won the series 2-0. Symonds came with a good innings with good support from Clarke. Its always going to be difficult to chase a score of 250-plus on this slow wicket. Bangladesh lost early wickets as well but Bashar stuck in and made 70 runs.They were well short of the target and all the bowlers came up with good spells. Symonds was declared Man-of-Match. Please join us for the final ODI to be played at the same venue on Friday. Cheers and bye!
