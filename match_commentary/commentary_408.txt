There you go, Razzaq is opening the bowling
Fahad: "I've been to see Razzaq in a few county games over the last few years... and I certainly wouldn't trust him with 4 overs. He is simply too slow now."
Ryan: "Looking at Pakistan squad, they should fix the top five batsmen into their positions permanently. They then have the options to juggle around with three good all rounders - Razzaq, Malik & Afridi at 6,7,8. This way it gives the the fire power in later stage of the innings. As the Sri Lanka pitches are apparently spin friendly, Pakistan only need one specialist bowler in Gul and Razzaq can be the other catalyst as and when required. He is experienced enough at this level to do both jobs and so is Afridi." Does the team management have enough confidence to trust Razzaq with four overs? He's hardly bowled this series, though he's delivered in the only over he's got.
Adil: "So the team selection suggests that both teams have taken safe route. I guess no team want to go to WC with a loss in thier last game. It will be interesting to see if Pak change their batting order and go with a better opener than the captain himslef, Kamran can be a good option."
Mohammad Akram, Pakistan bowling coach, on his approach: "A bowler should go through the physical and mental grind for two years in domestic cricket. He should also be taught to handle the media and should be groomed before he comes to the international level. We used to bowl for two hours at a stretch. Nowadays, players watch their videos and are happy to bowl for 15 minutes. We don't have as much talent now as we used to. I want talented youngsters to be given annual training programmes and I want to monitor them. I am confident we will unearth good talent, fast bowlers as well as spinners. As long as I am there, it should not be that a player is removed after playing one match. I want to guide a player how to react in various situations."
7.30 pm Pakistan win the toss again and will have a bowl
Mohammad Hafeez: "We have one change. Yasir Arafat is back and Sohail Tanvir is rested. We wanted to get the right momentum for the World T20 and the boys are responding well."
George Bailey: "We would have had a bat so that worked out well. Glenn Maxwell comes in for David Hussey. That [the second T20I] was the first time I have been involved in a Super Over."
7.15 pm Welcome to our coverage of the third and final Twenty20 international between Pakistan and Australia in Dubai. Two contrasting matches later, Pakistan have won the series. Can Australia win this one? No side would want to go into a world event having lost its previous series 0-3. Have a look at Dan Brettig's preview for the game.
 Innings Start
That is it from us for the moment for this series. Abhishek Purohit signing off. Cheers
Hafeez accepts the series trophy, Umar Akmal wants it immediately, he gets it now, and Pakistan sit down to pose for the cameras.
George Bailey: "David and Shane set up an awesome foundations for us, and our bowlers backed it up, they were terrific. We certainly do [have a chance in the World T20]. It is about harnessing our talent."
Mohammad Hafeez: "My team were exceptional in the series, unfortunately we could not do well today. Warner and Watson came out with a plan and attacked the specialist bowlers. We came back with the ball later on. I was trying to give chance to some of the boys, this is a wake-up call for some of us for the mega event, we have to play our roles according to the situation."
Saeed Ajmal is the Man of the Series. Ajmal: "i have enjoyed bowling against the Aussies. We had a meeting that we needed to win the T20I series. We have had good practice and are looking forward to the World T20."
David Warner is the Man of the Match. Warner: "I got to go back and work on batting on slow wickets. Just about backing yourself and doing what you do in practice."
