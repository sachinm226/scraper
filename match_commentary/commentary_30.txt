5:10 pm A magnificent last 10 overs have got them slightly above what they'd have looked at around the 30-over mark. Can Australia make a fist of this? Join Peter in about 40 minutes to find out
Meanwhile, India and Australia will also come face-to-face at the men's hockey Pro League this season. A big tournament, it assumes added significance this year because of the Tokyo Olympics in July-August. India begin with two home matches against the Netherlands this weekend. Here are four reasons why you cannot afford to miss a minute of action.
Scorers at the ground have clarified that five penalty runs were not awarded for running on the pitch.
49.6;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run smashed straight to the cover fielder, and they run one. That gets India to 340.;
49.5;1;Starc to Shami, 1 run yorker. Shami does well to get enough bat on it to get Jadeja on strike;
49.4;W;Starc to Jadeja, OUT and that's Rahul gone. Well done for being so unselfish, to be fair. Went through to the keeper and Rahul as desperate to get back on strike. Carey got the direct hit; a diving Rahul was well out of his crease;KL Rahul run out (?Carey) 80 (52b 6x4 3x6) SR: 153.84;
49.3;1b;Starc to Rahul, 1 bye misses it completely. Slower ball and a wild hoick that goes through to the keeper. They run a bye Australia aren't too concerned with preventing;
49.2;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run pull shot gets Rahul back on strike. He's on 80 with 4 balls to go. Any chance of a 100?;
49.1;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run no timing from the batsman. Went straight up but into a gap.;
48.6;1;Cummins to Rahul, 1 run keeps the strike for the last over;
48.5;4;Cummins to Rahul, FOUR runs attempted yorker, but Rahul moved back in his crease, and flicked it to fine leg for four. A diving Labuschagne can't prevent it;
48.4;6;Cummins to Rahul, SIX runs Cummins has tried to be too clever by half. This short ball Rahul was lying in wait for. Just opened the face of the bat and helped it away over third man all the way for six. Incredible shot.;
48.3;?;Cummins to Rahul, no run full pace, shorter delivery. Rahul swings, but for once, doesn't connect;
48.2;2;Cummins to Rahul, 2 runs slower bouncer. Rahul turns his bat into a periscope and sort of tennis-smashes it to midwicket. Sharp running by the duo again, they have been superb;
48.1;1;Cummins to Jadeja, 1 run slower short delivery. Struck to extra cover. They still scamper through;
45.6;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run sensibly keeps it short once more. But expensive over. Australia would have been counting on Starc, and his next two overs may be crucial to the game's outcome;
45.5;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run short ball, helped away to the leg side;
45.5;1w;Starc to Rahul, 1 wide dragged down. This is a costly over, and 300 is up for India;
45.4;6;Starc to Rahul, SIX runs is that the shot of the day? I'd venture to say so. Starc at full tilt, and he's lifted him over extra cover for six as if he was Chris Harris on sedatives. Rahul has so much time right now;
45.3;4;Starc to Rahul, FOUR runs low full toss; this isn't good enough, but KL Rahul most certainly is. Pure timing which beats the man at deep cover-point, and he brings up his 50;
45.2;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run short delivery, looking to pepper Jadeja, I suspect. He gets off strike;
45.1;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run crunched to cover-point. Beautiful timing on it;
44.6;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run smart running. Just timed to mid-off and he's on his way;
44.5;1;Kane Richardson to Jadeja, 1 run carved to sweeper cover;
44.4;?;Kane Richardson to Jadeja, no run guided to backward point. Thinks about a run, thinks again;
44.3;4;Kane Richardson to Jadeja, FOUR runs four first delivery. You couldn't ask for a better one to be eased in. Down legside at pace, and all he needed to do was get a feather on it and watch it race away;
44.2;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run ungainly hoick that's nowhere near the middle. Jadeja on strike;
44.1;W;Kane Richardson to Pandey, OUT top edged from Pandey, no timing on it and Agar completes a much easier catch this time. Was banged in short and Pandey went for the short arm jab, failing to find the middle of the bat;Manish Pandey c Agar b Richardson 2 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
47.6;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run full toss on leg stump. Very, very fortunate Jadeja's sent this right down to fine leg. That had four written all over it;
47.5;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run helped down to the fine leg fielder;
47.4;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run low full toss, thwacked to deep midwicket;
47.4;1w;Starc to Jadeja, 1 wide dragged down. Big wide. So big KL Rahul toyed with the idea of coming through for a bye;
47.3;2;Starc to Jadeja, 2 runs full, reverse swinging yorker, but Jadeja smears it down to the onside and scampers back once more;
47.2;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run run down to third man;
47.1;4;Starc to Rahul, FOUR runs backfoot punch, gorgeous shot again. What can you do about that? Bowling at 145, but Rahul still slices it away past third man for four;
46.6;2;Kane Richardson to Jadeja, 2 runs clever running once more. Chipped into the vacant space on the legside and Jadeja hares back for two more. 8 off that over;
46.5;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run runs it down to backward point;
46.4;1;Kane Richardson to Jadeja, 1 run slower bouncer, nudged away to deep midwicket;
46.3;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run tonked down to cow corner. Rahul is timing the ball so sweetly right now;
46.2;1;Kane Richardson to Jadeja, 1 run smashes it down the ground, runs well clear of the pitch this time;
46.1;2;Kane Richardson to Jadeja, 2 runs slower ball again. Jadeja works it away to the onside, and absolutely races back for two. He might have been running quicker than Richardson's bowling right now;
43.6;1;Zampa to Pandey, 1 run this one darted through. Thick inside edge and he keeps the strike;
43.5;1;Zampa to Rahul, 1 run chipped to deep midwicket;
43.4;1;Zampa to Pandey, 1 run driven to long-off;
43.3;?;Zampa to Pandey, no run brave enough to give it more flight now. Defended to the covers;
43.2;1;Zampa to Rahul, 1 run paddled away to the leg side;
43.1;W;Zampa to Kohli, OUT he's gone! Zampa's got Kohli again! What a catch that is! Kohli lofted him straight back over his head, looked for all the world it would go for six but for some incredible work on the boundary. Agar takes a clean catch about six inches from the rope, feels himself going over and lobs the ball over to Starc. Incredible coordination for an incredibly big wicket;Virat Kohli c Starc b Zampa 78 (76b 6x4 0x6) SR: 102.63;
42.6;1;Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run slower ball, nudged into the offside. Good over from Australia at this stage;
42.5;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run sweetly timed to midwicket. Fielder does well to keep it to one;
42.4;2;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 2 runs thumped over cover. No timing once more, but plenty of muscle on it;
42.3;?;Kane Richardson to Rahul, no run nearly dragged it onto his stumps. Cannoned into his pads and Rahul frantically searched around for the ball to ensure it didn't trickle onto his stumps;
42.2;1;Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run takes the pace off again. Cross-batted down the ground;
42.1;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run slower ball. No pace to work it, but Rahul smears it down to the sweeper for one;
41.6;2;Agar to Kohli, 2 runs dinked into the onside, and the lack of pace means the two can come back for a couple. Excellent batting by India. They appear to be scoring big runs without taking risks;
41.5;1;Agar to Rahul, 1 run crunches it down to long-on;
41.4;2;Agar to Rahul, 2 runs rocks back and carves it behind third man. 10 off the over already;
41.3;6;Agar to Rahul, SIX runs overpitches it, and pays the price! Full flighted ball, and there's no turn. Rahaul lofts it back over the bowler's head and it cannons into the sightscreen. Gorgeous shot;
41.2;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run good length from Agar. Not allowing Kohli to come down the track or rock back. Takes a single down long-on instead;
41.1;1;Agar to Rahul, 1 run nudged square on the leg side;
40.6;1;Zampa to Rahul, 1 run back down the ground and Rahul keeps the strike;
40.5;1;Zampa to Kohli, 1 run worked away for one;
40.4;4;Zampa to Kohli, FOUR runs cross-batted slog sweep - what a shot that is! Bottom hand sweep that Kohli somehow managed to keep along the ground without getting down on one knee, and pierces the gap between deep midwicket and long on;
40.3;1;Zampa to Rahul, 1 run another close call, but the batsman's inside edge gets him off strike;
40.2;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run stopped in the pitch a little, and nearly went through Rahul's bat-pad gap;
40.1;1;Zampa to Kohli, 1 run a bit of flight, flicked to wide long-on. Kohli's still in canter mode;
39.6;4;Kane Richardson to Rahul, FOUR runs good length on middle, shuffles across to paddle pull fine behind square, super shot and beats the leg side sweeper to the rope.;
39.5;1;Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run fullish length on middle, flicked to deep midwicket.;
39.4;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run good length on fourth stump, goes back to create room to cut to the sweeper.;
39.3;1;Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run good length on fifth stump, cut to the sweeper.;
39.2;?;Kane Richardson to Kohli, no run missed runout opportunity! Slower ball on off stump guided to Smith at backward point. Rahul took off from the non-striker's end, Smith tried to guide a throw back to Richardson over the stumps instead of firing for a direct hit. Too gentle and allowed Rahul time to get back. Throw was errant too high trying to lob it. Double-whammy.;
39.1;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run full on the legs, flicked to deep square leg.;
38.6;?;Agar to Kohli, no run flighted again on a full length on off stump at 81 kph, defended into the off side.;
38.5;1;Agar to Rahul, 1 run good length but tighter on off stump, taps this through the covers.;
38.4;4;Agar to Rahul, FOUR runs too short, too wide, too sweetly timed a cut shot by Rahul past backward point, cover sweeper is too wide to cut it off.;
38.3;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run floated fuller and straying on the legs, gets the front leg out of the way to drive to long-on.;
38.2;?;Agar to Kohli, no run good length but width on fifth stump, goes back to cut, beaten by extra bounce.;
38.1;1;Agar to Rahul, 1 run good length ball on off, goes back to punch to the cover sweeper.;
37.6;1;Cummins to Rahul, 1 run short on fourth stump, knocked down just wide of the stumps for a sharp run.;
37.5;?;Cummins to Rahul, no run short on the stumps, knocked down to backward point.;
37.4;1;Cummins to Kohli, 1 run bouncer on the stumps, swatted down through midwicket.;
37.3;?;Cummins to Kohli, no run good length ball on fifth stump, goes back to punch through cover but the ball keeps very low dribbling through to Carey.;

36.1;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run flighted full on fourth stump, pushed firmly to long-off.;
35.6;?;Cummins to Rahul, no run good length ball on off, defended to point. Kohli to be on strike for the next over, nobody complaining in Rajkot.;

35.4;?;Cummins to Kohli, no run good length ball on middle stump, taps this straight to midwicket.;
35.3;?;Cummins to Kohli, no run good length ball on off stump, tries to tap and run, can't get it away.;
35.2;4;Cummins to Kohli, FOUR runs hummana hummana! Same line and length, this time Kohli stays in his crease and drives it through extra cover.;
35.1;4;Cummins to Kohli, FOUR runs yum yum yum! Fullish length on about fifth stump, but Kohli shuffles back and across to whip this through midwicket.;
34.6;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run flighted full, defended back to Zampa.;
34.5;1;Zampa to Kohli, 1 run very full on middle, toe-jammed out to long-on. Cursory bat raise to the dressing room and fans for his half-century at a run a ball.;
34.4;1;Zampa to Rahul, 1 run slightly short drifting into the legs, goes back to clip behind square.;
34.3;1;Zampa to Kohli, 1 run full and wide, drives this along the ground to the sweeper.;

33.5;4;Starc to Kohli, FOUR runs oof! What a shot! short on fifth stump, ball wasn't really coming onto the bat but Kohli's hands are so good, keeps them back long enough to still have power with the wrists to crack this past extra cover, no chance for the sweeper.;

32.5;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run stretches forward to a full ball and pushes this tentatively short of extra cover.;
32.4;W;Zampa to Iyer, OUT scratchy knock comes to an end with an ungainly hoick. Pressure was building ever so slightly on Shreyas, Zampa floats this one up on a fullish length on middle stump, the batsman goes for an impetuous flick heave across the line and misses badly. Middle stump knocked back. Not a shot you'd be putting in an Instagram story.;Shreyas Iyer b Zampa 7 (17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 41.17;
32.3;?;Zampa to Iyer, no run full on off, scuffs a drive back to Zampa.;

30.1;1;Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run back of a length on off stump, guided to deep third man.;

28.6;?;Kane Richardson to Iyer, no run short of a length. 7 runs and a wicket from the 29th;
28.5;?;Kane Richardson to Iyer, no run welcomes him to the crease with a bouncer. Iyer is an interesting move, though;
28.4;W;Kane Richardson to S Dhawan, OUT what just happened there! Dhawan has holed out for 96! It was under the armpit, the line Australia have targeted for so long. Dhawan used the pace, timed it perfectly, but saw it carry straight to the fielder at fine leg. Tremendous innings, but doesn't get him to three figures;Shikhar Dhawan c Starc b Richardson 96 (90b 13x4 1x6) SR: 106.66;
28.3;4;Kane Richardson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs the hundred partnership comes up! And how! Sees the slower ball early, rocks back, waits for it, and deposits it back over Richardson's head for four;
28.2;1;Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run slower ball, Kohli reads it early, and works it away to the on-side. Partnership is 99 now;
28.1;2;Kane Richardson to Kohli, 2 runs backfoot punch through the covers. The sweeper on the boundary has a chase on, and keeps it to two;
27.6;4;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, FOUR runs ruins the over for Australia. Just outside leg stump, and Dhawan helps it on with a cross batted thump. Beats fine leg. 6 from that one;
27.5;1;Labuschagne to Kohli, 1 run Kohli eases it back down to long-on. Very content to just hand Dhawan back the strike for now;
27.4;1;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, 1 run another drag down, but Dhawan again only finds the boundary fielder;
27.3;?;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, no run bit more flight. Slightly uppish on its way to midwciket;
27.2;?;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, no run straight back to the bowler;
27.1;?;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, no run smart bowling. Dhawan gave it away early by coming down the wicket, Labuschagne drags it down;
26.6;1;Agar to S Dhawan, 1 run and Dhawan keeps the strike. 12 from this over. Are India finally moving up a gear?;
26.5;?;Agar to S Dhawan, no run strikes him on the pad. Slight appeal from Agar;
26.4;4;Agar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs and the poor ball comes. Down the onside, and Dhawan helps it to the fine leg boundary. This may well be Agar's last over;
26.3;6;Agar to S Dhawan, SIX runs that's enormous. Dances down the track and absolutely thwacks this into the stand behind cow corner. The sweetness of the timing on that!;
26.2;?;Agar to S Dhawan, no run runs down the ground, nearly yorks himself, though. Rare dot delivery;
26.1;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run opens the bat face to short third. Good running again;
25.6;?;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, no run pushes Dhawan onto the back foot. Muffled appeal; the bowler seemed to believe it had brushed Dhawan's pad. Nothing doing, though;
25.5;1;Labuschagne to Kohli, 1 run block and run;
25.4;1;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, 1 run dragged down, fortunate Dhawan found the on side boundary rider instead of a gap;
25.3;1;Labuschagne to Kohli, 1 run eased to deep midwicket;
25.2;1;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, 1 run uppish, nearly a caught-and-bowled. Chipped it over the bowler's head, no timing. Had Marnus been three inches taller, Dhawan would be gone;
25.1;4;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, FOUR runs disdainfully sliced to the backward point boundary. Dhawan on fire isn't the best time to be asked to come on. Especially if you're a part-timer;
24.6;1;Agar to S Dhawan, 1 run keeps the strike. 10 from the over;
24.5;4;Agar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs and now the reverse sweep comes out! Helps it beat the third man fielder. Dhawan's moving up gears!;
24.4;4;Agar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs lifts it over midwicket, exquisite sweep shot. Not much wrong with the delivery, really, but Dhawan's timing and placement is superb;

24.2;?;Agar to Kohli, no run and again, straight back to Agar;
24.1;?;Agar to Kohli, no run bit of air given to the ball, Kohli whacks it back to the bowler. On the bounce, mind you. Relax;
23.6;?;Starc to S Dhawan, no run cramps him for room, Dhawan blocks;
23.5;2;Starc to S Dhawan, 2 runs finally middles that pick-up shot. Labuschagne had a bit of sharp work to do at deep midwicket, and keeps it down to two.;
23.4;?;Starc to S Dhawan, no run bouncer. Seemed a bit high, but Starc gets away with it;
23.3;?;Starc to S Dhawan, no run dragged back, driven to mid-off;
23.3;1w;Starc to S Dhawan, 1 wide seems a concerted plan to frustrate Dhawan down the onside. He tried to help this one aerially over fine leg, too. Something to watch out for;
23.2;1;Starc to Kohli, 1 run back of a length, Kohli quick with his footwork and punches it down to midwicket for one;
23.1;1;Starc to S Dhawan, 1 run Dhawan wanted to lift this over square leg. thick inside edge onto the pad, and the pair scramble a single instead;
22.6;1;Agar to S Dhawan, 1 run cruise control for India right now. Another leg side single;
22.5;?;Agar to S Dhawan, no run slight turn beats the inside edge of the bat;

21.5;4;Starc to S Dhawan, FOUR runs flashes, flashes hard, flashes hard enough the edge beats a leaping wicketkeeper! Races away for four. Decent delivery from Starc, deserved a better outcome;
21.4;1;Starc to Kohli, 1 run persists with the leg stump line to Kohli. Too easy for him to nudge it to fine leg once more;
21.3;?;Starc to Kohli, no run crunched to extra cover, the timing not there to find a gap;
21.2;1;Starc to S Dhawan, 1 run and that's a half-century for Dhawan! Two in as many ODIs. His 29th half-century. The previous game will remind him he needs more than that;
21.1;1;Starc to Kohli, 1 run begins with one around the ribcage, nurdled down to fine leg;
20.6;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run keeps the strike after prodding this one to the leg side;
20.5;1;Agar to S Dhawan, 1 run that's another way to get a single. Goes over the top, clears mid-on, and the ball goes on the bounce to long-on;
20.4;?;Agar to S Dhawan, no run worked to the onside. Thought about a run, but the onrushing fielder made him reconsider;
20.3;?;Agar to S Dhawan, no run blocked;
20.2;?;Agar to S Dhawan, no run runs down the wicket, but Agar rushes the ball through. Dhawan has to adjust and rives it back to the bowler;

13.3;W;Zampa to Rohit Sharma, OUT so classy for so much of this first hour, Rohit looks very clumsy falling over to this missed sweep and is given lbw. But he's gone for the review! And it's frankly a terrible review. He clearly lost his bearings falling off balance losing any sense of where he was in front of the stumps. Missed this full ball and was struck halfway up the shin. The ball was ripping out middle and off stump 3/4 of the way up. Shikhar should be equally at fault on the wasted review for not talking him out of it if he's got a good view at the non-striker's end.;Rohit Sharma lbw b Zampa 42 (44b 6x4 0x6) SR: 95.45;

8.1;?;Kane Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run back foot punch, straight to a fielder though;
7.6;4;Cummins to S Dhawan, FOUR runs too easy fro Dhawan. Cummins goes down the legside again, and Dhawan just needs to flick it down to fine leg. The fielder isn't even at the boundary, but I suspect that might not have made a difference;

48.3;?;Cummins to Rahul, no run full pace, shorter delivery. Rahul swings, but for once, doesn't connect;
48.2;2;Cummins to Rahul, 2 runs slower bouncer. Rahul turns his bat into a periscope and sort of tennis-smashes it to midwicket. Sharp running by the duo again, they have been superb;
48.1;1;Cummins to Jadeja, 1 run slower short delivery. Struck to extra cover. They still scamper through;
45.6;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run sensibly keeps it short once more. But expensive over. Australia would have been counting on Starc, and his next two overs may be crucial to the game's outcome;
45.5;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run short ball, helped away to the leg side;
45.5;1w;Starc to Rahul, 1 wide dragged down. This is a costly over, and 300 is up for India;
45.4;6;Starc to Rahul, SIX runs is that the shot of the day? I'd venture to say so. Starc at full tilt, and he's lifted him over extra cover for six as if he was Chris Harris on sedatives. Rahul has so much time right now;
45.3;4;Starc to Rahul, FOUR runs low full toss; this isn't good enough, but KL Rahul most certainly is. Pure timing which beats the man at deep cover-point, and he brings up his 50;

45.1;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run crunched to cover-point. Beautiful timing on it;

44.2;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run ungainly hoick that's nowhere near the middle. Jadeja on strike;
44.1;W;Kane Richardson to Pandey, OUT top edged from Pandey, no timing on it and Agar completes a much easier catch this time. Was banged in short and Pandey went for the short arm jab, failing to find the middle of the bat;Manish Pandey c Agar b Richardson 2 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;

47.4;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run low full toss, thwacked to deep midwicket;

47.2;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run run down to third man;

46.1;2;Kane Richardson to Jadeja, 2 runs slower ball again. Jadeja works it away to the onside, and absolutely races back for two. He might have been running quicker than Richardson's bowling right now;

43.1;W;Zampa to Kohli, OUT he's gone! Zampa's got Kohli again! What a catch that is! Kohli lofted him straight back over his head, looked for all the world it would go for six but for some incredible work on the boundary. Agar takes a clean catch about six inches from the rope, feels himself going over and lobs the ball over to Starc.

42.2;1;Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run takes the pace off again. Cross-batted down the ground;
42.1;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run slower ball. No pace to work it, but Rahul smears it down to the sweeper for one;
41.6;2;Agar to Kohli, 2 runs dinked into the onside, and the lack of pace means the two can come back for a couple. Excellent batting by India. They appear to be scoring big runs without taking risks;
41.5;1;Agar to Rahul, 1 run crunches it down to long-on;
41.4;2;Agar to Rahul, 2 runs rocks back and carves it behind third man. 10 off the over already;
41.3;6;Agar to Rahul, SIX runs overpitches it, and pays the price! Full flighted ball, and there's no turn. Rahaul lofts it back over the bowler's head and it cannons into the sightscreen. Gorgeous shot;
41.2;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run good length from Agar. Not allowing Kohli to come down the track or rock back. Takes a single down long-on instead;

40.5;1;Zampa to Kohli, 1 run worked away for one;

28.3;4;Kane Richardson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs the hundred partnership comes up! And how! Sees the slower ball early, rocks back, waits for it, and deposits it back over Richardson's head for four;
28.2;1;Kane Richardson to Kohli, 1 run slower ball, Kohli reads it early, and works it away to the on-side. Partnership is 99 now;
28.1;2;Kane Richardson to Kohli, 2 runs backfoot punch through the covers. The sweeper on the boundary has a chase on, and keeps it to two;
27.6;4;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, FOUR runs ruins the over for Australia. Just outside leg stump, and Dhawan helps it on with a cross batted thump. Beats fine leg. 6 from that one;
27.5;1;Labuschagne to Kohli, 1 run Kohli eases it back down to long-on. Very content to just hand Dhawan back the strike for now;
27.4;1;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, 1 run another drag down, but Dhawan again only finds the boundary fielder;
27.3;?;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, no run bit more flight. Slightly uppish on its way to midwciket;
27.2;?;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, no run straight back to the bowler;
27.1;?;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, no run smart bowling. Dhawan gave it away early by coming down the wicket, Labuschagne drags it down;
26.6;1;Agar to S Dhawan, 1 run and Dhawan keeps the strike. 12 from this over. Are India finally moving up a gear?;
26.5;?;Agar to S Dhawan, no run strikes him on the pad. Slight appeal from Agar;
26.4;4;Agar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs and the poor ball comes. Down the onside, and Dhawan helps it to the fine leg boundary. This may well be Agar's last over;
26.3;6;Agar to S Dhawan, SIX runs that's enormous. Dances down the track and absolutely thwacks this into the stand behind cow corner. The sweetness of the timing on that!;
26.2;?;Agar to S Dhawan, no run runs down the ground, nearly yorks himself, though. Rare dot delivery;
26.1;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run opens the bat face to short third. Good running again;
25.6;?;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, no run pushes Dhawan onto the back foot. Muffled appeal; the bowler seemed to believe it had brushed Dhawan's pad. Nothing doing, though;

25.2;1;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, 1 run uppish, nearly a caught-and-bowled. Chipped it over the bowler's head, no timing. Had Marnus been three inches taller, Dhawan would be gone;
25.1;4;Labuschagne to S Dhawan, FOUR runs disdainfully sliced to the backward point boundary. Dhawan on fire isn't the best time to be asked to come on. Especially if you're a part-timer;
24.6;1;Agar to S Dhawan, 1 run keeps the strike. 10 from the over;
24.5;4;Agar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs and now the reverse sweep comes out! Helps it beat the third man fielder. Dhawan's moving up gears!;
24.4;4;Agar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs lifts it over midwicket, exquisite sweep shot. Not much wrong with the delivery, really, but Dhawan's timing and placement is superb;

24.2;?;Agar to Kohli, no run and again, straight back to Agar;
24.1;?;Agar to Kohli, no run bit of air given to the ball, Kohli whacks it back to the bowler. On the bounce, mind you. Relax;
23.6;?;Starc to S Dhawan, no run cramps him for room, Dhawan blocks;
23.5;2;Starc to S Dhawan, 2 runs finally middles that pick-up shot. Labuschagne had a bit of sharp work to do at deep midwicket, and keeps it down to two.;

23.3;?;Starc to S Dhawan, no run dragged back, driven to mid-off;
23.3;1w;Starc to S Dhawan, 1 wide seems a concerted plan to frustrate Dhawan down the onside. He tried to help this one aerially over fine leg, too. Something to watch out for;
23.2;1;Starc to Kohli, 1 run back of a length, Kohli quick with his footwork and punches it down to midwicket for one;
23.1;1;Starc to S Dhawan, 1 run Dhawan wanted to lift this over square leg. thick inside edge onto the pad, and the pair scramble a single instead;

21.6;1;Starc to S Dhawan, 1 run sends this down the legside, and Dhawan helps it on to fine leg. Good over for India again;
21.5;4;Starc to S Dhawan, FOUR runs flashes, flashes hard, flashes hard enough the edge beats a leaping wicketkeeper! Races away for four. Decent delivery from Starc, deserved a better outcome;
21.4;1;Starc to Kohli, 1 run persists with the leg stump line to Kohli. Too easy for him to nudge it to fine leg once more;
21.3;?;Starc to Kohli, no run crunched to extra cover, the timing not there to find a gap;
21.2;1;Starc to S Dhawan, 1 run and that's a half-century for Dhawan! Two in as many ODIs. His 29th half-century. The previous game will remind him he needs more than that;
21.1;1;Starc to Kohli, 1 run begins with one around the ribcage, nurdled down to fine leg;
20.6;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run keeps the strike after prodding this one to the leg side;

13.3;W;Zampa to Rohit Sharma, OUT so classy for so much of this first hour, Rohit looks very clumsy falling over to this missed sweep and is given lbw. But he's gone for the review! And it's frankly a terrible review. He clearly lost his bearings falling off balance losing any sense of where he was in front of the stumps. Missed this full ball and was struck halfway up the shin. The ball was ripping out middle and off stump 3/4 of the way up. Shikhar should be equally at fault on the wasted review for not talking him out of it if he's got a good view at the non-striker's end.;Rohit Sharma lbw b Zampa 42 (44b 6x4 0x6) SR: 95.45;

8.1;?;Kane Richardson to Rohit Sharma, no run back foot punch, straight to a fielder though;

Unnat: "@Kaig what is aggressive for you? 10 overs 60/0 in a 50 over game would be considered aggressive, wouldn't it Danyal?" It depends on each team, but for India, this is a perfect start, I'd imagine
 Innings Start
10:00 pm That's it from us on commentary today. Sid Monga's report is up. Stay tuned for more reporting from the ground by Vishal Dikshit. Thanks for staying with us today. For Danyal Rasool, I'm Peter Della Penna. Come back in two days for the series finale at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. Take care!
KL Rahul is the Man of the Match: "I couldn't have asked for a better start. Each day I've been thrown a different role or responsibility and I'm enjoying it for now. [Batting at No. 5] Obviously it's a different position. The only plan I had was to give myself a couple of balls. Having had a chat with Virat, he said the ball is coming on nicely. Once I got a couple balls out of the middle of the bat, then it just becomes about bat and ball. All the other things in your mind fade away. Very happy with the way I got a few partnerships. The past couple of months I had to keep for Karnataka as well so hopefully I'll keep the bowlers happy."
Virat Kohli: "[About batting at No. 4] We live in the days of social media and a panic button being pressed too early. It's very important to figure out the best team you can put on the park and when you see how KL was batting today, it's very difficult to leave someone like that out. Batting at No. 5 and batting like that for the team, this is probably the best he's played at international level. That knocked showed maturity and class. We know exactly what we're doing in the change room. On the outside there's a lot of panic that we don't really focus on. Back to No. 3 was good for the team so I'm happy from that point of view that it helped the team. In ODI cricket, Shikhar has been one of our most consistent performers. I'm very happy that he scored runs as well. It always augurs well when he and Rohit score runs. I asked Rohit briefly just now. It's that left shoulder that has popped out a few times. There's no tear so hopefully he should be back for the next game.
[On the yorkers at the death]. I'm very pleased to see that. I asked the bowlers what they wanted to do and they said this is the time to execute our yorkers. All three executed brilliantly."
Aaron Finch: "They played very well. The whole way through the [first] innings, we were one wicket shy of containing then where they needed to be. [Zampa's] bowling really well at the moment. I thought the way that Smithy started today, though not quite going through to the end, and Marnus in his first hit in ODIs, they spend every minute of the day together. You just have to make sure that when you get in, you capitalize and go really big. We were just slight behind as the run rate kept going up."
Presentation time...
Vik Macherla: "I see KLR as more of a surgical knife while Pant more of a blunt hammer. Each has their merits but at this stage - prepping for the next set of world cup - my vote would be Rahul." We're still three years away!
Sandy: "So Rishabh Pant -the WK Batsman or KL - The Batsman-WK for bengaluru??" I doubt you're the only one thinking this.
9:33 pm So it's all square heading into the third ODI. Kuldeep Yadav is speaking pitch side. "It's been a tough four or five months after the World Cup but now I'm getting back into rhythm and bowling really well. Marnus and Smith were batting really well. When I came for the last spell, I was looking for the wicket. I found that the wicket was a bit slow and the ball was getting soft. So bowling slow through the air it was tough to hit me down the ground."

43.3;2lb;Shami to Starc, 2 leg byes nearly! Another yorker, this time heading for leg stump, Starc plays around it, huge appeal but looked like it was trailing down leg. Given not out and they scamper a pair of leg byes.;
43.2;W;Shami to Cummins, OUT action replay of the previous ball! Another middle stump yorker, Cummins can't keep this out trying to stab at it defensively. Shami is on a hat-trick.;Pat Cummins b Mohammed Shami 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
43.1;W;Shami to Turner, OUT steady diet of yorkers and this is one too many for Turner to digest! This one is dialed in on middle stump, Turner premeditated backing away to drive over cover and swings over the top of this. Great bowling.;Ashton Turner b Mohammed Shami 13 (15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 86.66;

42.3;2;Saini to Agar, 2 runs shin height full toss on fourth stumps, guided behind point and they scamper two.;
42.2;4;Saini to Agar, FOUR runs short and wide, cut hard to deep point, Rohit runs across and puts in a dive to cut this off, looks like he may have injured his left shoulder. He's writhing around in pain clutching vigorously. His body was in contact with the rope as he slid to stop it. Looks grim. He's off the field.;
42.1;4;Saini to Agar, FOUR runs bouncer on the stumps, poorly directed and Agar swivels to hook this through vacant deep backward square.;
41.6;2;Kuldeep to Turner, 2 runs slog sweep to a full ball goes off a top-edge sky high toward deep backward square. Chahal on as a sub for Dhawan most of the innings runs in from the boundary but grows alligator arms as the ball hurtles back toward earth. It lands three yards in front of him. Never looked remotely interested in diving.;

40.1;4;Bumrah to Agar, FOUR runs good length ball angled across fourth stump, Agar just dabs this with the angle toward Saini at deep third man, didn't have far to go to cut this off but Saini looking gimpy all night on that left ankle and it beats him easily.;
39.6;2;Shami to Turner, 2 runs they scamper back for two, taking on the long-on fielder. 7 off that over, and here's Peter to take you to the finish;
39.5;?;Shami to Turner, no run well bowled. Full ball defended straight back to Shami;
39.4;1;Shami to Agar, 1 run swiped down to cow corner. Gets Turner back on strike. The required rate has climbed to 10.5;

39.3;?;Shami to Agar, no run aggressive bouncer, Agar gets out of the way;
39.2;1lb;Shami to Turner, 1 leg bye huge appeal from India. Full delivery that struck Turner on the toe, but umpire unconvinced. India review It's missing leg stump. Australia still retain that glimmer of hope;
39.1;2;Shami to Turner, 2 runs muscled away to the on-side for a couple. Turner needs to have a go soon.;
38.6;1;Bumrah to Turner, 1 run sharp running. Turner keeps the strike as the asking rate moves above 10;
38.5;4lb;Bumrah to Turner, 4 leg byes legbyes for four. Much, much needed for Australia. Slightly misdirected from Bumrah for once, and it beats the man at fine leg;

38.3;?;Bumrah to Agar, no run thick outside edge. Another slower delivery, and it goes through to Rahul on the bounce;
38.2;?;Bumrah to Agar, no run slower ball, Agar doesn't know much about it;
38.1;1;Bumrah to Turner, 1 run worked to square leg. With Bumrah, India looking for the killer blow;
37.6;?;Kuldeep to Agar, no run blocked. Match-turning over, surely;
37.5;W;Kuldeep to Smith, OUT what an over this is! Smith falls two runs shy of a 100! Nothing in the delivery, really, but Smith plays on. Kuldeep is making a difference after an indifferent day up to this over. Is this the game?;Steven Smith b Kuldeep Yadav 98 (102b 9x4 1x6) SR: 96.07;
37.4;?;Kuldeep to Smith, no run beats him with the googly. Another tight over, this;
37.3;1;Kuldeep to Turner, 1 run off the mark with a backfoot punch;
37.2;W;Kuldeep to Carey, OUT the softest of dismissals, and Rajkot breathes again. Checked his shot instead of going through with it, and it goes straight to extra cover for the simplest catch. 100 wickets for Kuldeep Yadav;Alex Carey c Kohli b Kuldeep Yadav 18 (17b 0x4 1x6) SR: 105.88;
37.1;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run eased onto the onside. 2 runs away now;
36.6;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run the bounce beats him again. Thick inside edge. Saini's rescued the over somewhat after the boundary;
36.5;?;Saini to Smith, no run beaten by the bounce. Went under the bat, doubled Smith over slightly;
36.4;?;Saini to Smith, no run defended back to the bowler;
36.3;4;Saini to Smith, FOUR runs excellent placement. Ever so slightly wide off off, and he leaps on to it, beats backward point, and there's nothing third man can do about it. Smith moves to 96;
36.2;1;Saini to Carey, 1 run back of a length, rushes Carey even though it was just 133 kph;
36.1;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run begins with a length delivery, flicked to midwicket;

35.1;?;Kuldeep to Smith, no run defended;
34.6;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run and keeps the strike. A couple of excellent overs for Australia. Runs coming without too many risks;
34.5;6;Jadeja to Smith, SIX runs makes up for it, and then some! Who said Smith doesn't have power hitting ability. Right from the middle and it goes 90 METRES into the stands;
34.4;?;Jadeja to Smith, no run length pulled back, Smith sends it to a fielder;
34.3;1;Jadeja to Carey, 1 run the glance keeps the scoreboard ticking over;

34.1;1;Jadeja to Carey, 1 run carved to point, and it brings up the 200;
33.6;2;Kuldeep to Smith, 2 runs long hop that Smith works to midwicket. 13 off the over. That should help with the rising asking rate;
33.5;3;Kuldeep to Carey, 3 runs beats the man in the in-field, but decent work from Saini on the boundary prevents the four;
33.4;6;Kuldeep to Carey, SIX runs that's what Carey should be doing more. Gets down low and smears it over cow corner. Not middled, but it still comfortably sails over the rope and into the stands;
33.3;?;Kuldeep to Carey, no run wrong'un. Carey had no idea about it, nearly found himself trapped plumb in front;
33.2;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run comes down the ground but the outcome doesn't quite match the aggressive intent;
33.1;1;Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run flighted nicely, and Carey finally decides to play a conventional shot down to long-off;
32.6;1;Jadeja to Carey, 1 run single down to long-on;
32.5;?;Jadeja to Carey, no run a third reverse sweep from Carey. So far, it hasn't really produced results;

32.2;?;Jadeja to Smith, no run uppishly played back to Jadeja;
32.1;1;Jadeja to Carey, 1 run another reverse sweep, but a diving Chahal prevents three. Excellent fielding;
31.6;1;Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run nice drive. Four off the Kuldeep over, and the asking rate begins to rise once more;
31.5;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run nearly lost balance there. Thought about sweeping, realised it was too full, and nearly fell over getting the ball away to square leg;
31.4;?;Kuldeep to Smith, no run driven back to the bowler;
31.3;1;Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run now the regular sweep, and a misfield at short fine leg gets him off the mark;
31.2;?;Kuldeep to Carey, no run Reverse sweeps Kuldeep first up. Lacked conviction, though, and it produces no runs;
31.1;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run helps it down to fine leg. Smith looking to carry on as if nothing has happened;
30.6;?;Jadeja to Carey, no run defends first up. Big, big over for India;
30.5;W;Jadeja to Labuschagne, OUT and that's the wicket! Rajkot erupts! He is furious with himself! Came down the track but seemed caught in two minds as regards to whether he should chip it or look to clear the mid-off fielder. Ends up as the most comfortable catch for Mohammad Shami. Huge, huge scalp;Marnus Labuschagne c Mohammed Shami b Jadeja 46 (47b 4x4 0x6) SR: 97.87;
30.4;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run better ball, pushes Smith back, but he manages to work it away for a run;
30.3;4;Jadeja to Smith, FOUR runs no timing, that was uppish, just out of Jadeja's reach. It goes all the way for four, though, and you can hear a pin drop;

30.1;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run;
29.6;?;Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run bouncer, beats the attempted hook. Good ball, but can't dislodge Labuschagne.;

28.4;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run full on middle, driven to long-on.;
28.3;?;Jadeja to Smith, no run stone dead! Has to be! Given not out! Kohli calls for the review. Smith did his traditional back and across but missed in front of middle stump halfway up just above the knee roll but very deep in his crease. DRS ball-tracking shows... Umpire's call clipping the leg bails! Extremely brave from umpire Kettleborough to give that not out on field.;

19.4;1;Shami to Smith, 1 run comfortably flicked down to the onside;
19.3;1;Shami to Labuschagne, 1 run uses the pace of the bowler to work it to third man. Wasn't middled, but had enough on it to go through to Kuldeep on the bounce;

19.1;1;Shami to Labuschagne, 1 run opens the face of the blade and eases it to third man. The pace is back because these two looked so settled against spin;
18.6;4;Kuldeep to Smith, FOUR runs How good is that shot? Pretty darn good, I'd say. Picks the line and length early, moves across, and absolutely bludgeons a slog-sweep for four. This is a nice little spell for Australia;
18.5;1;Kuldeep to Labuschagne, 1 run cross batted shot down to off stumo;
18.4;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run another wrong'un, but starts it outside leg stump. Flicked down to fine leg;

17.5;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run runs it down to long-on;
17.4;4;Jadeja to Smith, FOUR runs brilliant shot. Rocks back and punches it to the left of extra cover, and it's placed nicely enough to evade a diving sweeper cover;
17.3;1;Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run sloppy fielding. Good delivery, but of flight and turn, but the bowler and mid-off get into a bit of a tangle, presenting the opportunity to steal a run;
17.2;2;Jadeja to Labuschagne, 2 runs sliced to backward point and the two scamper back for a couple;
17.1;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run worked away to the onside;
16.6;2;Kuldeep to Labuschagne, 2 runs paddled down to fine leg. Could Labuschagne, in his first ODI, be the man who guides Australia home? That's me getting carried away;
16.5;4;Kuldeep to Labuschagne, FOUR runs he's on his way! Mid-off was in the circle, and Kuldeep bowled a wrong-un, but he takes it on anyway and smashes him over the fielder;
16.4;?;Kuldeep to Labuschagne, no run shap fielding from Virat, a dive prevents the single;
16.3;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run another wrong-un, but slightly short and Smith has enough time to rock back and ease it to the onside;

16.1;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run nicely flighted, opens the face of the bat to guide it to backward point;
15.6;?;Jadeja to Labuschagne, no run sliced to cover. Successful over for India;
15.5;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run nearly a catch, that! The ball stopped and flew up in the air, agonisingly out of the reach of a valiantly diving Jadeja.;
15.4;1;Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run guides it down to long-off;
15.3;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run same shot, different batsman;
15.2;1;Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run turn and flight, drives it down to long-off;
15.1;W;Jadeja to Finch, OUT have they got their man? Yes, they have! Finch opened his body up to smash it over extra cover, but was beaten by the turn. Excellent glovework by KL Rahul, who whips the bails off while Finch's foot is on the line. Incredibly tight call, but I think giving it out is the right one. Dhoni would have been proud of that;Aaron Finch st ?Rahul b Jadeja 33 (48b 3x4 0x6) SR: 68.75;
14.6;2;Kuldeep to Smith, 2 runs another wrong-un, Smith lobs this into the air with the turn. The in-fielder on the offside thought he was in with a chance but it's well out of his grasp. Eight off that over;
14.5;1;Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run helped to the onside;
14.4;2;Kuldeep to Finch, 2 runs heaveed over to cow corner. No real timing, but gets two;
14.3;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run wrong-un. Finch didn't seem to pick it, and went for a sweep that would have made more sense with the turn. Beaten, but has his foot planted, so the stumping isn't a threat;
14.2;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run paddled away to fine leg. Smith is continuing to find ways of keeping the asking rate in check;
14.1;2;Kuldeep to Smith, 2 runs starts off with a loosener outside leg, which Smith easily guides to square leg;
13.6;2;Saini to Finch, 2 runs prods it into the onside and hares back for two. Could Finch finally be on his way to a big score?;
13.5;4;Saini to Finch, FOUR runs a gimme ball that Finch gratefully accepts. Pace onto his pad, allowing Finch to hop across and put it away behind square leg. Big pressure reliever, that;
13.4;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run short and wide, Smith moves across and leans into it to nudge the ball to third man;
13.3;1;Saini to Finch, 1 run blocks and runs. Finch isn't quite finding the timing at the moment;
13.2;?;Saini to Finch, no run dragged down the onside, gets a tickle on the pad. Kohli thought there was an edge; there wasn't;
13.1;?;Saini to Finch, no run did the pitch misbehave there? Finch thought it was nicely set up for a cracking square cut, but the ball kept well low;
12.6;?;Jadeja to Smith, no run eased away to midwicket. Another tight over from India;

11.6;1;Saini to Finch, 1 run full and straight, mistimed to mid-on and they scamper through. Eventful over;
11.5;?;Saini to Finch, no run short ball, swing and a miss;
11.4;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run big runout chance. Smith bloacked and ran, and a diving Rohit Sharma simply needed to hit the stumps. Suicidal running, gets away with it;
11.3;1;Saini to Finch, 1 run driven to mid-on and the pair swap ends;
11.2;?;Saini to Finch, no run nice line. Doesn't give him enough room to open up the offside - not far away from taking his edge;
11.1;?;Saini to Finch, no run full, wicket-to-wicket line. Finch thought about running, but thought better of it;
10.6;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run keeps the strike with one through the covers;
10.5;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run defended into the covers;
10.4;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run happy to milk Jadeja for singles for now;
