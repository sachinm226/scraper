Data
2.50pm Australia have taken only three wickets in the innings. They have never taken fewer than that in a completed ODI innings before. India lost Dhawan early but Rohit and Kohli put on 207 runs for the second wicket to set India up. And then Rohit stayed the course to provide the innings an aggressive finish. He ended unbeaten on 171, the highest score by a visiting batsman against Australia in Australia, beating Viv Richards' 153* in 1979.
Is this total enough? It's a strong score for sure, but this pitch is great for batting and Australia bat deep. I reckon we have a game on our hands. My opinion is that India were on course for about 320-330 and didn't get there. Over to Deiva Muthu for the start of the chase.
Melinda Farrell from the WACA: "Mitchell Johnson just did a lap of honour on the back of a ute with his little one. Very warm response from the largely indian crowd."




Amogh: "Hazzlewood was the difference between 330 and 309. India need their spinners to strangle Australia."
venkat: "Rohit had started 2015 with ton - 138 - against Aus and now again started new year with ton - 171 - against same team"
ravi: "I think 309 is as good as 330 as the current rules have restricted slogging in last 10 overs. Australia would have to click in unison to get this total.The highest chased total at this ground is only 274!!!"
suren: "What is interesting is the 50+ runs Rohit scored over long on.... Warner, Finch & Maxwell may also target the area and it may be too costly for India..."
Amar : "can you please tell which player has the most number of ODI scores of more than 150?" Sachin Tendulkar with five such scores
Nitesh: "Warner also got 178 against Afg at Perth, seems like a happy hunting ground for dashing openers :-) these days"

 Innings Start
6:52pm: Sran, the debutant, made early incisions to dismiss the openers, but centuries from Smith and Bailey helped Australia marmalise the chase. Bailey, who was let-off on his first ball, combined well with Smith, as they repaired the damage with risk-free batting. The pair then hit the accelerator and did not take their foot off it on a batting-friendly pitch.
India's bowlers had fared well in the early exchanges before fading away in the face of the Bailey-Smith double-century stand. Sran showed off his range with some floaty bouncers, back-of-the-hand slower balls, but Ashwin and Jadeja lacked penetration.
Steven Smith is the Man of the Match.
That is all we have for you. Many thanks for turning in and sending mails. Do come back for the second ODI on Friday. Until then, goodbye and cheerio.

Venkat: "India started with loss in both 2015 and 2016, Both are against Aus in Australia and Rohit scored centuries in both matches."
Aj: "150+ runs taken from the spinners in the middle.
