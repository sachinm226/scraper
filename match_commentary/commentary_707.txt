Data
Australia end up with 290 for 7. That's been the pattern of the series so far - Australia bat first and pile it on. The only saving grace for India is that they kept that down to under 300. Still though, they will have to bat out of their skins.
Symonds deserved a ton but nevertheless, did what was expected of him. Hayden and Clarke chipped in with useful half-centuries. Dhoni spoke about India's tendency to let things slip after the 30th over and today was no different. They conceded 150 in the last 20 overs.
Join us for the post-lunch session in a while. Jamie will take you through the first 15 overs. Cheers

Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the third ODI between India and Australia at Hyderabad.
News from the middle is that a fit-again Ricky Ponting has won the toss and Australia will bat.
I'm Jamie Alter, and together with Kanishkaa Balachandran will be bringing you today's commentary.
India have made one change, bringing in Rohit Sharma for Ramesh Powar. Sourav Ganguly is still not fully fit. Australia have, rather surprisingly, omitted Brad Haddin, who scored fluent half-centuries in the first two games, for Ponting. Brad Hodge, with scores of 0 and 3 so far, is persisted with.
There's a bit of rain in the air so everyone will be keeping an eye on that.
As we wait for the start, do peruse George Binoy's spiffing preview from the ground.
Looks to be a pretty full house at Uppal. Yes, its packed. And as the Australian openers and the home side walk out, the stadium erupts to the country's latest anthem, Chak De India. Zaheer has the new ball, 191 ODI wickets so far. Dhoni puts in two slips next to himself. Gilchrist to face.
 Innings Start
Another clinical display by Australia as they win by 47 runs and lead the series 2-0 with four more to play. In the end India's batting card was the story of one man - Yuvraj Singh. His 121 went in vain primarily because the others didn't support him for long periods. Tendulkar and Dhoni gave India hope but perished as the asking rate increased.
The game was virtually lost when Australia had the home side on the mat at 13 for 3 and to make matters worse, runs were hard to come by. It was a collective perfomance from the bowlers, with Brad Hogg and Brett Lee taking three wickets apiece. They always have a way of clawing back after taking a bit of stick early on and that's what seperates a good team from a champion team.
All three games have followed a familiar pattern - Australia bat first and pile it on, India just can't make it. Sounds rather boring, frankly speaking. What we need is a contest and playing on batting wickets isn't helping. One would hope that the playing surfaces in the remaining games offer something for the bowlers.
That's it from us today. This is Kanishkaa Balachandran signing off. Jamie Alter says goodbye too. Join us for the 4th match in Chandigarh on October 8. Cheers.
Btw, Andrew Symonds is the Man of the Match for his 89.

Thanks, Kramer. Hello everyone and welcome back for India's reply. With Sourav Ganguly still out it will be Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir to get them off.
In related news, a lawyer from Jalandhar has filed a criminal complaint against the Indian team for "disrespecting" the national flag after winning the Twenty20 tournament. Just read that on the news feed. Some people just arent satisfied.
And over in Karachi the hosts need 194 to beat South Africa with five wickets remaining on day five.
Back to this game - we're moments away from resuming. Brett Lee will bowl to Gambhir. Two slips. Flags waving, placards swaying, fans cheering. Play ball, says umpire Shastri!
