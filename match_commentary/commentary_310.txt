3.02 pm Tea What an innings this has been! He was on 192. A few batsmen would have cared about that 200, but Australia's captain cool doesn't. Australia are all our for 530. Imagine where they were at the start of the day - 259 for 5 - and where they have ended up. One would imagine a quick-scoring hour after a team has gone past 450, but Australia played with that intensity all day today. That run rate which was below three at the end of day one ends up at 3.71. India's bowlers, not for the first time this year, were directionless, inconsistent with their lines, and clueless.
Brad: "Excluding Smith in both cases, in this innings the top 5 batsmen made a total of 153 and the lower 5 batsmen made 168. This compares to the 2nd Test where the top 5 made 152 and the lower 5 made 201. Fast becoming a habit!"
srikanth: "Can Indian Supreme court also ban Indian cricket overseas test tours keeping public interest in mind ?"
142.3;W;Yadav to Smith, OUT he has lost his middle stump! He goes all the way to the off side to play a ramp shot, but misses a straight delivery. It strikes the top of middle stump.

 Innings Start
Lunch is extended by half an hour as Australia play on. Alright, the declaration has come. It's lunch now. Strange session. It was expected that Australia would come out, smoke a few around, and then put India to bat. But Marsh and Harris moved at a slow place throughout the morning, scoring runs at 2.7 runs an over. Marsh's innings ended in a tragedy as he was run out for 99, one short of what would have been his first century at home. India have been set 384-run target in 70 overs
Mac: "Steven Smith declares the moment he hears lunch will be delayed by half an hour. Clearly, he is hungry and has zero confidence in India getting one of numbers 10 or 11 out within half an hour!"
Jared: "I feel this morning was the most tactically baffling session of cricket I've seen. The whole point of batting on would have seemed to be to get quick runs and leave India in doubt about when they'll bat, ideally leaving them with an awkward four overs before lunch. Instead Australia make a stodgy 50-odd runs and kindly give the batsmen the regulation lunch break to set themselves. Meanwhile India seemed to be playing for a draw in a must win match. Something in the water in Melbourne?"
Suva: "Now that the session is over, it doesn't seem too baffling now. Australia is in a great position because of all the overs consumed this morning. India can either try to get over 5 an over for 70 overs and risk it all or shut shop which lets the Aussies attack with more close in fielders."
Jonno_Mc: "The only satisfying thing about this morning's play has been the pun "Marsh got bogged down"."

4.23 pm And that is tea. India will be happy with that session, having got rid of the in-form Steven Smith. Australia haven't run away with the game, but are still ahead, having stretched the lead to 239. Back in 20 minutes.
Ranjeet: "The wickets of Smith and Rogers has put the game in the balance. A few quick wickets and India could be chasing around 300-310 which is not impossible. Some quick runs and India could well be looking at 400+ on the last day. Going by the form book the latter seems more likely - but as of now things are even-stevens."
Rob: "The problem with the Steven Smith dismissal is that Dhoni will now continue employing that luck-based strategy for more tests, when it would be better to attack in the off stump channel with slips"
anil: "what's the close of play time today including the half hour extra" ---- The game can go on till late today - till 7 pm - as the light remains good here.
 Innings Start
Another match that lasted the distance. However, there are a number of issues that will need a post-mortem. Was Australia's declaration timing ok? Why did India rejig the batting order? What about Watson's place? Will Rohit Sharma be back in Sydney? Dhoni's captaincy? The Virat-Johnson love affair.. Plenty of topics to be covered by our analysts in the next two days. Enjoy the new year's party. We will catch up at Sydney. Thanks for the comments and feedback. Ciao ciao.
"It was a tough five days on a pretty flat wicket. Couple of drop catches in the field cost us dear," says Steven Smith. "India played well, but we have got the series. The wicket did not deteriorate much and they had some strong batting, so we wanted to take it away from them. It was about keeping the series safe, rather than Shaun's hundred. We came close here but it wasn't enough. We are looking forward to make it 3-0 in Sydney. Rhino was outstanding with the bat and with the ball, helped us build up a strong total in the first innings."
"Quite happy with the draw. Could have ended in a mess on the last day," says MS Dhoni. "The bowlers really bowled well, especially in the second innings. I don't really want to comment on (declaration). If your batsman reaches 90 than you have to wait for him. We have found ways to trouble ourselves. We have got good partnerships in all tests, but we play loose shots. If you are playing well, then you need to carry the momentum forward. It was a bit slow (pitch) in the last hour and you feel the pressure. It was a fantastic display (Rahane-Kohli stand). Especially, because both of them looked to attack the bowling. Secondly, they both made sure they converted it to a big hundred. We need a bit of time. it's new side, not everyone is experienced. Over the last six months, they are getting better. It is a matter of time before we start delivering. We don't have an allrounder, but I am happy the way the bowlers bowled"
Ryan Harris is the Man of the Match for his first innings 74 and his six wickets
And that is it. Smith and Dhoni shake hands with four overs left in the game. Some thought India would go for the chase, some thought Australia would give themselves more time.. but this has ended in a draw in a rather tame fashion. I was bracing for more hop and jump action in the last four overs, but it was not to be. A batsman's game, this has been. Australia scored heavily in the first innings, India responded in kind. Then, in the last two days, it looked like we were heading towards and Adelaide-like finish, but then Australia took their time before declaring on the fifth day, ensuring along the way that they had a firm grasp on the B-G trophy, and very nearly made it 3-0. But the pitch lacked the zing bowlers needed and India, despite the hiccups, managed to survive a nervous last session. Excellent batting hands from both sides - Steven Smith continued piling on runs, so did Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane. There was also a handy 99 in the second innings from Shaun Marsh, which is going to help him cement is place in the side for a while.
sbansban: "Can't figure why Smith didn't bowl those last 24 deliveries - all they needed was one good delivery to break this last partnership of two batters with some pretense of batting skills and then just three more to get rid of nine, ten and Jack.. "
Boll: "Draw probably a fair result. ..much as I was cheering for an Aussie win. Despite Oz being ahead in all 3 games, the way these young Indian batsmen have played has been brilliant to watch. Lots of chat about the amount of short form cricket played in India, but when you`re producing young, classical batsman as India seem to be doing, you must be doing something right. Virat Kohli, whatever you think of him as a bloke, has been absolutely stunning this series, and some of the other youngsters not far behind him. Looking forward to Sydney."
Prasanna S: "Despite all the critics Dhoni has shown what's missing with these young crop of Indian cricketers in a tight situation - 'Maturity', thank you captain cool for a draw."
Nithin: "Asking Pujara to bat down the order was indeed great move by Dhoni, he played 70 balls in the later part. With his form he would not have survived in swinging and pacey conditions"
Bala: "What "swinging and pacey conditions" are you talking about? The conditions throughout this test, and I would go so far as to say this series, have been extremely batsmen-friendly. You don't just blindly repeat "pace and bounce" just because this is Australia."



"Do you have a question about this Test, Mel Farrell and Gav Joshi cannot wait to answer them on the day 5 edition of #PoliteEnquiries. Send your questions on Twitter using that hashtag, they won't declare early".
