So, West Indies finish on 234 for six, thanks to two fine half-centuries from Brian Lara and Runako Morton. The captain scored 71 from 94 deliveries while Morton remained unbeaten on 90 from 103 deliveries. The duo put on a fine 137-run stand for the fifth wicket which was the backbone of the West Indian innings.
Australia need 235 to win. Please join us in about 40 minutes for their reply. It'll be Sriram to start you through the innings, while for now I go and rummage for some food to eat. Cheers!

0.1;?;Lee to Hinds, no run Right on money. Full and swinging in, Hinds restricts his front movement across and jabs the ball away.;

On a warmy sunny day Brian Lara won the important toss and has chosen to bat. I am Sriram Veera and along with Jamie Alter will bring you the day's play.
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, out due to a stomach bug, and Fidel Edwards have been replaced by Runako Morton by Jerome Taylor. Also Ian Bradshaw in for Corey Colleymore.
Ian Bradshaw had sounded pretty optimistic on the eve of the game. ""We believe that we have the talent within this side not only to win the next game against Australia but to finish at the top of our group and progress to the semi finals." Now time to walk the talk.
Nathan Bracken finds a place in the playing eleven. I saw him in the practice game against MCA XI at a suburban ground in Mumbai. He bled at the hands of Rohit Sharma and one wondered whether he will get a nod. So it should be interesting to see how he goes. Usually gets to swing the white ball around.

Wavell Hinds and Chris Gayle have walked out to the middle. Here we go.
 Innings Start
They're all in celebration, those West Indians, jumping and whooping it up; here comes a hobbling Lara, beaming from cheek to cheek. Gayle is the one enjoying this the most, he's yelling out so that everyone from Nariman Point to Walkeshwar hears him! Fantastic scenes at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai. The crowd has raised its decibal levels to a joyous din.
The match scenario, again - West Indies, defending champions, defeated Australia by 10 runs. Lara won the toss, decided to bat, and scored a fine 71 in a 137-run stand for the fifth wicket with Runako Morton, who remained unbeaten on 90 from 103 balls as West Indies made 234 for six.
In reply, Australia lost wickets at regular intervals up the order before Adam Gilchrist and Michael Clarke added 101 for the fifth wicket. Gilchrist had his eyes on another hundred, but was run out, while Clarke fell to another fine example of how to bowl a deadly slow ball at the death, courtesy Dwayne Bravo. That wicket sparked a dramatic collapse at the hands of Jerome Taylor, who became the first West Indian to sieze an ODI hat-trick. His victims: Hussey, Lee and Hogg. Taylor finished with 4 for 49.
Ricky Ponting, during the post-match conference, express his disappointment but looks ahead confidently at Australia's remaining two games.
Ramnaresh Sarwan, the West Indies' stand-in captain, singles out Lara and Morton for their partnership. He has words of gratitude to the all-round team effort, mentions the bowling of Bravo and Taylor. He admits he had some nerves, and laughs off the Gayle-Clarke tension we saw in the middle.
The Man-of-the-Match award goes to Morton for his unbeaten 90. He's a pleased man as well; mentions the difficulty of the pitch but glad he was able to bat throughout and stay there until the end.
That's all we have for you tonight. Hope you've enjoyed this match as much as I have. Its good night from me, Jamie Alter. Do join us for our live coverage of the next match of the Champions Trophy, between New Zealand and Sri Lanka on October 20 here in Mumbai. Cheers!
