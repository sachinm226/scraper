6.17 pm We've strayed a bit into the lunch break with Australia's over-rate slipping below what it should be. A few wides didn't help either. But aside from that they've done quite well against a batting line-up that loves ODIs, with the other Mitch staking his claim to be the main Mitch. But as well as Starc bowled for his 6 for 43, India haven't done too badly either. They recovered from a few early wickets but the final overs did not go according to plan. One of their top four stuck in nearly all the way. Rohit Sharma will cherish this century, but he would dearly hope the bowlers can ensure it ends up match-winning
DanielAlexander: "India were 185-3 after 34.5 overs, Brilliant comeback by the Australians " Only 30 runs off the last five overs, for two wickets as well
Jay: "Does Faulkner bowl anything else other than back of the hand slower ball? I bet all of his deliveries in the end was just that, effective though." What's that old saying, if it ain't broke...
Kunal: "Hence Proved - For every Virat Kohli Failure there is an opposite and equal Success of Rohit Sharma!"

49.1;1;Faulkner to Ashwin, 1 run starts off with the slower ball outside off. dabbed to short third man. Not quite enough pace for Ashwin to exploit;
48.6;?;Starc to Shami, no run good yorker on off stump and Shami does well to prevent three in three;
48.5;W;Starc to Bhuvneshwar, OUT cleaned him up! that's six! Changed the angle of delivery and came around the wicket to Bhuvi, the new batsman. It was full, it was speared in on middle. The batsman stayed beside the ball to open up the off side, but fails to connect with his shovel drive. Starc smile might as well translate as 'you miss, I hit';Bhuvneshwar Kumar b Starc 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
48.4;W;Starc to Rohit Sharma, OUT caught on the edge of the circle, that is Starc's fifth and it comes off his worst ball of the day - a full toss.

48.1;2;Starc to Ashwin, 2 runs is that his fifth? No, his new-ball partner Cummins drops it! Full and a shade wide, Ashwin did his bit by clearing the front leg and swinging for the cover fend. But gets a leading edge and the sweeper running in can't grab hold;

44.4;W;Starc to Axar Patel, OUT there goes another domino! Spearing yorker strikes the back leg with Akshar playing all around it. Would that have missed leg? Beaten for pace, beaten for movement and India are slipping;Axar Patel lbw b Starc 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
44.3;?;Starc to Axar Patel, no run cuts him in half with a full, fast inswinger. Akshar wants the booming cover drive, has to settle for his off stump being intact;

25.5;1;Sandhu to Rohit Sharma, 1 run appeal. loud and concerted from Sandhu. Then there's a shy at the stumps as well. That certainly would have been out. Struck on the back pad and he was buckling over, impact seemed ot be on off stump but Sandhu's natural bounce goes against him this time. And there was some bat too. Steven Smith wasn't worried about the appeal though, he saw Rohit sluggish to set off and sent down a good throw at the bowler's end. Missed the stumps with the batsman yards out;

24.1;1;Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run tucked in front of square leg to get off strike;

22.4;6;Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs so what does Rohit do? He flies down the pitch like a truck in a high speed chase and hammers a length ball handsomely over long-on to bring up his fifty. Emphatic;
22.3;?;Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, no run tries to beat gully with the open face against a back of a length delivery outside off, but Smith dives to his left and denies him again;

Mitch Starc is back
 Innings Start
That's our coverage for the game, thanks for your company and your comments. Join us as the tournament moves on to Brisbane when India take on England on Tuesday. Till then, this is Alagappan Muthu saying sayonara
Would have been nice if we hadn't left it up to Faulkner," says George Bailey "we dragged it back really well with the ball. We had the momentum whne we came off the fieled. Finch battled his natural game a bit, deserved a hundred and that partnership with Smith was good. We delayed India's charge leading to the death overs. Once again wickets at the end so important and Starc had a great night. Finchy's been in pretty good touch right htorugh the ear in ODIs, particularly in Australia. Tonight he played really hard between 40 and 60 and stuck it out
"Good game over all," says MS Dhoni. Mitch bowled really well, Rohit played brilliantly. But what was crucial was bowling with the new ball. The game was just drifting till the 30th over, but we picked up at 35 overs and once we got reverse swing we were able to put pressure. I said I don't care about the result, just keep in mind what happened after the last huddle. That will win us tournaments. We have to keep in mind that from now on, whatever games we play we need to execute"
"A lot depends on conditions, about how the wicket is behaving, specially with drop-in wickets. Also the dew factor, today there wasn't any. But if it was it becomes difficult to contain and then the composition of the attack. On the higher end of 270, should be defended because the bowlers will get extra bounce and will reverse. All three teams are top sides and it's important for the top order to take extra responsibility and give a total our bowlers are comfortable with it"
"The ball's coming out wlel and Australia's winning games. Great to contribute and it was a team effort. Picked up key wickets.Rohit batted well, but Finchy played well and Faulkner's finished it for us. I was a bit nervous, still am standing with pads on talking to you" says Mitchell Starc, the Man of the Match for the second match in a row
10.12 pm India were wayward to start, all of their bowlers got a bit too friendly with the leg stump. But 50 overs is a long time and they regained their disciplines in the death overs. But Aaron Finch had set the chase up with a controlled 96, there were three successive fifty partnerships at the top of the order to help the lower order keep their heads. So, another first-innings hundred ends in defeat. Poor Rohit
Andrew C: "Back to back MOMs for Mitchell?" Should be, yes
VJ: "Indian bowlers trying play like Dhoni , first almost lose the match, take it to the end and then try to win it from there. But to be Dhoni, you need little bit extra."
The Closer: "Is there a finisher in the game at the moment better then Faulkner?" How bout the best batsman in the world?
48.6;4;Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, FOUR runs full toss down leg, the Faulkner sweep dusts the game off! He does it time and time again, walks in with a few balls left and a tight game in the balance and swerves it Australia's way;

48.3;1;Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, 1 run down the track and slices a full toss into the covers, Faulkner runs with the shot and leaves Haddin in the lurch. Dhawan takes aim and misses the stumps, with Haddin nowhere in the frame;
48.2;4;Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, FOUR runs clattered to the long leg boundary. That's a sweep to a length ball from a medium pacer, and he took the ball right on top of the bounce too. Didn't hurt his timing one bit;
48.1;1;Bhuvneshwar to Haddin, 1 run terrific bowling, but they nab a single into the leg side. Cramps Haddin up with a fuller ball on middle, which was blocked;
47.6;?;Axar Patel to Faulkner, no run stays back and chops a flat, length ball into the covers;
47.5;?;Axar Patel to Faulkner, no run shake of the head as Dhoni and Akshar and a few thousand India fans appeal in unison. Good length ball meets the sweep, beats it and struck under the knee roll. But perhaps it did not straighten from the angle enough. Umpire's call on clipping leg stump;

47.3;1lb;Axar Patel to Faulkner, 1 leg bye full and fired in on leg stump, Faulkner is struck on the pads and weathers a huge lbw appeal. Would be sliding down leg;

46.2;?;Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, no run back of a length and outside off, not enough room for Maxi to exploit with the punch through point;

44.1;?;Yadav to Haddin, no run back of a length and outside off, gets a bottom edge behind the wicket;
43.6;4;Ashwin to Maxwell, FOUR runs goes for the encore, but he has to settle for a four this time. Jumps down the track and clatters another good length ball into the sightscreen and away goes the advantage India whisked out of nothing;
43.5;6;Ashwin to Maxwell, SIX runs down the track and pummels a length ball over the straight boundary. Clean ball-striking;

43.3;1;Ashwin to Haddin, 1 run flighted on leg stump, pushed to long-on;
43.2;W;Ashwin to Bailey, OUT has he done it? Yes! Beautiful stumping!

42.3;?;Yadav to Bailey, no run back of a length on middle, defended;

40.1;W;Yadav to Finch, OUT nicks to the keeper! Finch misses out on a hundred on his home ground. Looks to force a short ball that seems to gain a bit more bounce than he expected. Feather through the keeper gives India a bit of a boost;Aaron Finch c ?Dhoni b Yadav 96 (161m 127b 5x4 2x6) SR: 75.59;

30.2;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run;
30.1;2;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 2 runs was there an edge? Dhoni had come up to the stumps and has to negotiate a bit of extra bounce. Finch didnt' do well against it, and Dhoni can't do much better either. Very difficult chance;
29.6;?;Ashwin to Smith, no run full on middle, pushed back at the bowler;

24.2;1;Shami to Smith, 1 run uses the width on offer and sends the length ball wandering away to third man;
24.1;1;Shami to Finch, 1 run fuller delivery outside off brings out the Finch cover drive. Handsome stroke, and he does appear far more solid against pace;
23.6;1;Ashwin to Finch, 1 run clipped away to deep midwicket;
23.5;1;Ashwin to Smith, 1 run clipped off the pads and Smith wants to get off the mark. Might be a risky run here, and the umps are calling for a second look. Excellent work from Dhoni who deflects the incoming throw onto the stumps. Sort of like a late cut played just with his hands and no bat;
23.4;?;Ashwin to Smith, no run opens the face against a good length ball that goes on with the arm. Adjusts late there;

22.5;?;Axar Patel to Smith, no run good length ball on off stump, defended;
22.4;W;Axar Patel to Watson, OUT slugs across the line and yells at himself as his off stump is knocked back. The Dhoni mantra works, reduce the runs, limit the boundaries and lure the mistake. Good, tight bowling from the left-arm darter;Shane Watson b Patel 41 (47m 39b 5x4 1x6) SR: 105.12;

18.3;?;Axar Patel to Finch, no run pushed back at the bowler with a straight bat;

17.2;?;Ashwin to Watson, no run good length ball on off stump brings Watson forward to block;
17.1;2;Ashwin to Watson, 2 runs starts a bit too straight and he is picked away to long leg.;
16.6;?;Axar Patel to Finch, no run rapped on the pads again, but his angle into the batsman might be working against him on this shout. Across-the-line whip from Finch but he survives to have a drink and clear his mind;
16.5;?;Axar Patel to Finch, no run fired in on leg stump, too quick for Finch and his straight drive;
16.4;1;Axar Patel to Watson, 1 run gets down the track to drive the fuller delivery to long-on;

14.3;4;Axar Patel to Finch, FOUR runs pressure release as the ball is a bit short and Shami is not the best man at point, can't get across to his left fast enough;
14.2;?;Axar Patel to Finch, no run huge appeal from Akshar as Finch attempts something different. Gets a decent stride forward to sweep a fuller ball on off stump. Just a hint of turn, and perhaps the umpire thinks it would miss the target. Kohli is gutted, even comes up to ask the ump for a clarification. The impact might have been outside off;
14.1;?;Axar Patel to Finch, no run nudged to the left of short midiwcket as Akshar does what he does - cramp the batsman for room with his darts;
13.6;?;Yadav to Watson, no run corrects his line and length and keeps Watson to a dot as he seeks the top of off stump;

13.1;?;Yadav to Watson, no run wafts outside off and is beaten by a back of a length delivery outside off. Good channels from Umesh;
12.6;?;Axar Patel to Finch, no run fired in on middle, Finch keeps it out;
12.5;?;Axar Patel to Finch, no run fuller delivery on middle and leg, Finch drives back at the bowler;
12.4;1;Axar Patel to Watson, 1 run a bit short again and Watson has sliced it to the sweeper;
12.3;?;Axar Patel to Watson, no run tossed up on middle and leg, tucked to short midwicket;
12.2;?;Axar Patel to Watson, no run that's quicker and it skids into Watson way too quick for the pull. Mistimes into the leg side;
12.1;4;Axar Patel to Watson, FOUR runs drags the length short and Watson camps back in his crease and cuts behind point. Not the best start from yet another Indian bowler;
11.6;?;Yadav to Finch, no run 141kph, gets the ball to straighten and beat Finch all ends up! Finishes with a maiden as India concede only eight runs in the last four overs, and the wicket of Warner;
11.5;?;Yadav to Finch, no run beaten off a beautiful delivery, and the pressure that's been built. Attempts something extravagant off a back of a length delivery outside off as he steps forward ti drive on the up;
11.4;?;Yadav to Finch, no run forces a good length ball to cover point. India are stringing together a good stretch of dots now;
11.3;?;Yadav to Finch, no run back of a length on fifth stump, Finch brings down a straight bat;
11.2;?;Yadav to Finch, no run offcutter just a bit outside off, defended into the covers;
11.1;?;Yadav to Finch, no run shortish delivery on off stump, Finch blocks;
10.6;?;Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run reaches forward to drive a fuller ball outside off on the up, mistimes it to mid-off. Good control of length from Bhuvi;
10.5;?;Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run just short of a good length on middle, Watson picks short midwicket with a flick;
10.4;1;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run loosens the grip on his bat, runs a back of a length delivery to third man and secures a single;
10.3;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run solid stride forward to defend a fuller delivery to cover;
10.2;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run gets forward to the fuller ball outside off and taps to cover;

9.6;?;Yadav to Watson, no run pushes him back with a short ball on off stump, defended;
9.5;4;Yadav to Watson, FOUR runs offcutter from Umesh and there is a call of "catch it" from the Indian fielders, but the flick has bisected midwicket and mid-on;
9.4;?;Yadav to Watson, no run gets forward and blocks a back of a length delivery to cover;
9.3;?;Yadav to Watson, no run starts well against the new man, probing just a shade outside off with that in-between length. But to Watson and his famous front-foot press, that doesn't matter. Leaves it;
9.2;1;Yadav to Finch, 1 run full and slipping down leg, Finch helps it away to long leg;
9.1;W;Yadav to Warner, OUT skies it! Raina calls for it immediately and yells in delight after completing a soft dismissal. It was short of a good length, but Warner's front foot press works against him. Then he decided to play a sort of a pull shot when there wasn't much room. Ends up spooning a simple catch at extra cover, which was well taken.;David Warner c Raina b Yadav 24 (41m 22b 3x4 0x6) SR: 109.09;
8.6;1;Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 1 run picked away off his hips to long leg. Has the leg-side short-ball bug caught Bhuvi too?;
8.5;?;Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run shortish, but not quite wide enough. Warner slaps it to cover;
8.4;1;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run great work from short point, Suresh Raina moves to his right and stops a cracking cut shot. The deflection though is potential for a single and Warner capitalises;
8.3;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run gets the bottom of the bat again! We should really get on a name for that ball from Bhuvi. Finch was stepping forward to block, but the ball wanders behind him to slip;
8.2;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run keeps to the crease and pushes a good length ball into the covers;
8.1;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run fuller delivery on middle and leg, Finch defends towards mid-on;
7.6;2;Shami to Warner, 2 runs goes full on the pads this time and Warner works it to deep midwicket and takes on Virat Kohli's throw. Big dive, easily home;
7.5;?;Shami to Warner, no run stands and delivers a whip, which mid-on does well to stop, diving away to his right;
7.4;4;Shami to Warner, FOUR runs despairing dive from Kohli at deep square leg, but Warner's pull has too much heat on it. Shami errs by bowling short and a bit too straight;
7.3;1;Shami to Finch, 1 run seems to be right in line of the stumps, but he is able to flick the good length ball off his legs to deep midwicket;
7.2;?;Shami to Finch, no run decides to go along the ground this time as he drives a good length ball into the covers;
7.1;4;Shami to Finch, FOUR runs width offered and Finch accepts the present as he flays the fuller ball over mid-off. Powerful stroke;
6.6;1;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run gets back and across and tucks the shortish delivery away towards midwicket;
6.5;1;Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 1 run Rohit has a direct hit, but Warner is well home after a push towards mid-off. Decent throw off that angle, but despite being on the back foot Warner was immensely quick off the blocks;
6.4;?;Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run oof, did the ball clip off stump?! Or did it take the bottom of the bat? Definitely hit the bottom of the bat and it veers back towards the stumps, but misses it by a whisker!;
6.3;1;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run stands up tall and punches to the left of mid-off. Lovely straight bat coming down on the back of a length delivery;
6.2;1;Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 1 run opens the face against a shortish ball and slices it to deep point;
6.1;?;Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run firmly behind a back of a length delivery on off stump;
5.6;?;Shami to Finch, no run good length on off stump, Finch defends to mid-off and Shami walks back with a far better over under his belt. Had his pace up, had his radar right, just needs to reproduce it over and over and over;
5.5;?;Shami to Finch, no run 139 kph, has Finch in a spot of bother as he pings a shortish delivery down on off stump. Squares him up as the batsman uses an open face to run down to point;
5.4;1;Shami to Warner, 1 run takes on the short ball, with the field set for it! Nearly carries all the way to Akshar at deep square leg.;
5.3;1;Shami to Finch, 1 run seems to get a bit of a bottom edge to a good length ball only a shade outside off. Single to deep third man;
5.2;?;Shami to Finch, no run attempts a forcing drive off a good length ball on off stump, gets it off the inside of the bat and Shami gets a hand on it while following through;
5.1;?;Shami to Finch, no run brings Finch forward to protect his off stump. He should bowl better at the right-hander;
4.6;1;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run down the track to try and mess up Bhuvi's lovely lengths, ends up with an inside edge for his trouble and he retains strike as it goes towards square leg;
4.5;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run back of a length on off stump, Finch gets behind it;
4.4;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run shortish and outside off, Finch goes for the cut but seems to check it at the last minute;
4.3;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run back of a length on off stump, defended carefully;
4.2;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run tight line on off stump, Finch can only block down the pitch;
4.1;2;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 2 runs back of a length, yet Finch is confidently forward and taps to mid-off, who is under pressure as Finch sets off. Direct hit would have caught him short at the non-strikers', with Finch not diving. Ends up with an overthrow;
3.6;?;Shami to Warner, no run keeps to the crease and hits through the line of a back of a length delivery and finds mid-off;
3.5;?;Shami to Warner, no run 145kph, shortish on and around off stump, defended;
3.4;?;Shami to Warner, no run pendulums back to off stump and Warner pushes to mid-off;
3.3;4;Shami to Warner, FOUR runs one-legged pull to the square leg boundary, but this was the bowler's mistake again. Bowling short with the new ball, bowling on leg stump with the new ball. No pressure on Australia now;
3.2;?;Shami to Warner, no run much better, he needs to stick in that off-stump region. Back of a length delivery also keeps Warner honest;
3.2;1w;Shami to Warner, 1 wide 143 kph, short and sliding down leg again. This time Warner is happy to collect the wide;
3.1;4;Shami to Warner, FOUR runs oh dear, that's a terrible delivery to start off with. And Warner gleefully sends it away to the fine leg boundary. Short, way down leg and all the batsman had to do was help it away;
2.6;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run good length ball a shade outside off, gets some seam away as well, gets Finch's respect as well as he leaves;
2.5;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run clipped through midwicket as he gets in line with a length ball on middle;
2.4;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run leaps to his left at cover and lifts himself onto his knees soon after to prevent Finch from going for a single. Deserved some runs considering the timing on that back-foot cover drive;
2.3;2;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 2 runs picked away through to long leg;
2.2;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run mild appeal from Bhuvi as he corrects his length and line on middle. Might have been sliding down;
2.1;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run gets back and across against a shortish delivery, contact was a bit high on the bat as he cuts;
1.6;1lb;Yadav to Finch, 1 leg bye drifts towards the pads now from back of of length, deflects it down behind square for a leg bye;
1.5;4;Yadav to Finch, FOUR runs crunching drive, that looked glorious! Full outside off with the away movement and Finch got on top of it with an authoritative cover drive for four;
1.5;1w;Yadav to Finch, 1 wide this one's pretty wide too and swings away further outside off for a wide;
1.4;4;Yadav to Finch, FOUR runs flashes at it and gets four over the slips! It was pretty wide and short, Finch didn't time it very well but got enough to send it over slip;
1.3;1;Yadav to Warner, 1 run 144kph, induces the outside edge but it flies well past second slip to third man for one. Was slightly back of length outside off and it moved away as Warner defended off the back foot;
1.2;?;Yadav to Warner, no run back of length towards middle this time, tucked to midwicket and the fielder gets a direct hit at non-striker's. No overthrows;
1.1;2;Yadav to Warner, 2 runs back of length on the legs, clipped off the pads after a hop on the back foot to deep square leg for two;
0.6;3;Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 3 runs fullish outside off now, pushed through the covers off the front foot in the gap, Kohli chases and slides to pull it in;
0.5;?;Bhuvneshwar to Warner, no run back of length from leg towards middle, good bounce makes Warner go back and hop to defend it to leg;
0.4;1;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run length delivery swinging away a bit, pushed with a thickish edge down to third man for one;
0.4;1w;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 wide mixes it up with an outswinger this time, but it's well outside off for a wide;
0.3;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run shorter and wider outside off now, cut straight to point again;
0.2;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run wider outside off and coming in again, Finch chops it to point;
0.1;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run swings it in a little bit on length outside off, left alone;

6.45pm A short break there because of the slow over rate, Australia took an extra 26 minutes to bowl their 50 overs. Finch will take strike now, Bhuvneshwar has the first new ball with two slips. Here we go...
