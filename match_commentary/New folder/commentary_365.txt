Another failure from the famed India batting. Another day of sustained hostile fast bowling from Australia. Hilfenhaus was the most successful with four, but you can't find fault with any of their bowlers who relentlessly tested India's batsmen. It was a pitch with some juice in it in the morning, but nothing more than you'd expect from a regulation Test match surface. Can't put the 161 all out to demons in the track, more of a combination of good bowling and another day of poor shot selection.
Hang around, the Australian reply will start in a about five minutes.
Down and under: "A deliberate ploy by the Indian team to get out early so that they can subject the Aussies to the Fremantle Doctor on the very first day....And you thought we failed, huh ?"
The_Wicked_Wicket: "Okay - it's friggatriskaidekaphobia that's troubling the Indian team today.... the Indian team could attribute the collapse at Perth to "Friday, The Thirteenth - the Demons on the WACA Deck"!!"

Karthic from India: "second that!!if there are no runs on offer we will take puns !!"
 Innings Start
That's a 208-run lead for Australia. Enough to win by an innings? Umesh Yadav was the star for India with the ball, taking his maiden five-for and consistently bowling at a good pace. Australia had a collapse, but if you were going to collapse probably the best time to do it is after your openers had given you the lead.
The cracks are beginning to make an impact, with several deliveries sharply changing direction after hitting them. The Indian bowlers have done a solid job today, and it is time for the batting - supposedly India's strength - to back them up.
No doubting who the Indian fans are pinning their hopes on.
Akshay: "Need a Warner like innings from Sehwag. If he screws up today more questions will be asked on his position."
Ashutosh: "Nothing less than a Warner-like innings can give India any hopes of winning this match..yes, i said the word 'winning'...and we all know there is only one-man in the Indian team who can do that"

65.6;?;Vinay to Hussey, no run a loud appeal for lbw, not entirely sure Hussey was playing a shot at that time, bat was tucked behind pad as he attempted a half-hearted defence, he was struck on the pad just outside off, not sure that would have gone on to hit off anyway, replays show it would have shave the outside half of off stump, 50-50 going the batsman's way;

60.1;W;Khan to Haddin, OUT Zaheer gets his man! Haddin is gone for a duck, he was stuck on the crease as he pushes at that one outside off, that one angled in, Haddin misjudged how far in it was coming, a tickle through to Dhoni, Australia are six down, not a scoreline you'd have expected a couple of hours ago, Zaheer blew a kiss towards Haddin to send him on his way,;Brad Haddin c ?Dhoni b Khan 0 (7m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

Ishant is on now, as Dhoni desperately searches for a breakthrough
 Innings Start
Stunning performance from Australia, shocking performance from India. The match didn't even last half the distance, Australia win with two days and nearly two sessions to spare. If this doesn't prompt changes, not sure what will. And to think the series started with the two teams apparently evenly matched.
Here's Chris Gayle joking tweet: "I'm waiting on clearance from bcci to play in the 4th test against Australia!Fingers cross,I will get a crack at swing swung 4 prank! LOL"
Prashant Kumar: "Only person Australia weren't able to crack was Umesh Yadav - 2 not out innings and 5 wickets. Not too dissimilar from the stats in England last year: England's average 59.76, India's 25.55"
Jokes apart, it was another top-class display from the Aussie quicks, and David Warner played an innings that Mickey Arthur rated among the top he has ever seen.
Out stats editor Rajesh tweets: "Australia's ave runs per wicket in this series: 47.08; India's 22.90. "
Post-match presentation
Dhoni: "We didn't perform well up till now. Warner played really well, in that one session he took the game away from us. The failure in the batting definitely hurt us." Dhoni backs the seniors by saying "Class is always there, they have the experience, its just in two back-to-back series that we have failed."
"What has happened, the last couple of series, we have not adapted well to the conditions quickly enough. Winning in Adelaide is the only motivation we have now, the bowlers have shown they can take wickets, we need to put the runs on the board."
David Warner is the Man of the Match: "I was playing my natural game. I see myself as a batsman and look to score runs whenever I can. At the end of the day, in Test cricket most of the fielders are behind the wicket. So there will be a lot of scoring opportunities in front of the wicket. It's fantastic to bring up 200 with Cowan, we have found something there, we hope to continue it." The NBA could approach me after cricket, he jokes about his leap celebrating his hundred.
Michael Clarke: "A great feeling. A wonderful job from Warner, and Cowan deserves praise too." Lauds that 200 run stand. "Hobart was quite a tough wicket for the batters, the work we have put in, you can see the effects on our individual batters." Praises the bowling unit as well.
"I thought our selectors from the past also did their best,
the new coach, new selectors have brought new enthusiasm to the group which is exciting, the team has grown since the time I took over as captain, Ricky has helped a lot with his experience. We are going to have a few beers tonight. We want to win this series 4-0."
Clarke to Tom Moody: "I'm stoked, the boys are really happy. The bowling deserves credit, for getting out such an amazing batting line-up. Warner- it's like opening the batting with Gilly, he can hit it both side, I love his enthusiasm, he's a great asset for Australia, and he has a bright future. Our batting needs to work hard, our fielding is improving. Games like this are a reward for the hard work we put in."
Think Clarke's popularity is going to increase in Australia after this emphatic series win?
Dhoni to Dinesh Chopra: "We need to put runs on the board, getting out below 200, there's not much for the bowlers, in this Test we should have scored more runs. Virat batted really well, Dravid supported him, overall though we flopped. Australia's bowled kept on hitting the right areas, they kept building the pressure, it was a waiting game. It was a difficult wicket, there was something in it for the bowlers, Warner apart the batsmen struggled. [Changes?] We'll have to wait and watch, the last series we played overseas we didn't win a game, we want to win at Adelaide."
David Warner: "That's how I approach the game, credit to our bowlers as well. I wouldn't think any match is too easy. They keep nicking a lot, if we keep the ball outside off.. The 50 runs probably cost India as well after I got dropped. Our bowlers yesterday afternoon put in a great effort, and we could finish it off after lunch today."
Ian Chappell lays into India's selection committee, saying they have not been brave enough, and calling them short-sighted. He says there needs to be changes there.
Dan Brettig's match report will be updated here very shortly. And do check out all the analysis from our guys at ground. Calls for changes were loud enough before this match, and will be deafening before Adelaide. See you then!
