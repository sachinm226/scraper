Shillingford's dad proudly watches his son lead the team off the field
Lunch: So West Indies just about sneak in the last two wickets before lunch. They really should have done a lot better and the inability to finish things off will be addressed before they leave for England.
Another example of Australia's fighting spirit. There were a few hoicks and cuts that were missed so it wasn't flawless. But credit to Hilfenhaus for sticking it out. Without him, Wade wouldn't have reached his century.
Join us at 12.35. Alex will take you through the first hour.
Leroy: "Shillingford, is not the fist test player from Domonica there were players before him like Norbert Phillips and the Grayson and Irvine Shilingford."
Paul pointed out that England's Phil DeFreitas was also born in Dominica.

55.4;?;Shilling to Clarke, no run turning sharply into the pads, pushed between the two short legs;
55.3;1;Shilling to Ponting, 1 run full on the pads, and pushed for an easy, annoying single to long-on;
55.2;?;Shilling to Ponting, no run short of a lenght, stays back to cover the bounce, and defends;
55.1;2;Shilling to Ponting, 2 runs short, wide, despite the turn back in Ponting manages to punch it through the expanses on the off side;
54.6;?;Rampaul to Clarke, no run goes wide of the crease, length ball outside off, left alone;
54.5;2;Rampaul to Clarke, 2 runs late-cuts this, Brathwaite gets a hand to it at point, but they get two;
54.4;?;Rampaul to Clarke, no run length ball, headed for top of off, defended off the front foot;
54.3;?;Rampaul to Clarke, no run shaping in towards middle and leg, pushed to midwicket;
54.2;?;Rampaul to Clarke, no run short of a length, punched away to point;
54.1;?;Rampaul to Clarke, no run dangerous leave. This would have hit the fifth stump. Length ball, not too wide, and shoulders arms without covering the off stump. The ball moves back in, but not enough;
53.6;?;Shilling to Ponting, no run quick offbreak, more extra bounce. Ponting is forward and does well to keep it down;
53.5;?;Shilling to Ponting, no run toppie, but too full, and Ponting is right to its pitch, and then it doesn't matter how it is turning;
53.4;?;Shilling to Ponting, no run quicker, flatter offbreak, Ponting turns this to leg gully, on the bounce;
53.3;?;Shilling to Ponting, no run flighted outside off, Ponting lunges forward to push this to straight short extra cover;
53.2;1;Shilling to Clarke, 1 run Clarke shimmies down to turn this fullish ball past midwicket to get off strike again;
53.1;1;Shilling to Ponting, 1 run full on off, pushed to long-on. Can't be giving them such easy singles. Beats me;
52.6;?;Rampaul to Clarke, no run fuller, middle and work, worked away, but can't beat midwicket;
52.5;?;Rampaul to Clarke, no run short of a length, and Clarke tries the pull again. This time he is caught playing too high, but the inside-edge only finds his pad. Another near wicket;
52.4;2;Rampaul to Clarke, 2 runs short of a length, outside off, short-arm-pulled wide of deep midwicket;
52.3;?;Rampaul to Clarke, no run bouncer, too short, too far outside off. Clarke ducks;
52.2;1;Rampaul to Ponting, 1 run short of a length, just outside off, and this one actually moves away. Pushed square, past point for a single;
52.1;?;Rampaul to Ponting, no run full outside off, holding its line, left alone;
51.6;?;Shilling to Clarke, no run What does Shilly need to do to get a wicket here?. More bite, more turn, more bounce, towards Clarke's rib cage. Off the glove it goes, but square, and well wide of forward short leg. Shilly can't believe it;
51.5;?;Shilling to Clarke, no run flighted outside off, Clarke pushes forward and uses the pad as the first line of defence;
51.4;?;Shilling to Clarke, no run short of a length, and this jumps and bites, Clarke's bottom hand is off, but the ball hits him in the rib cage;
51.3;1;Shilling to Ponting, 1 run flighted outside off, Ponting pushes at it, doesn't get all of it, but pushes it past silly point, and there is no cover;
51.2;1;Shilling to Clarke, 1 run no mid-on - you've got to be kidding me. Clarke has pushed an easy single to long-on to get away from Shilly;
51.1;?;Shilling to Clarke, no run shimmies down the track, turns this to midwicket, but Deonarine makes sure Clarke stays on strike;
50.6;?;Rampaul to Ponting, no run short of a length, well outside off, Ponting gets back and across, gets an inside edge onto the pad. Rampaul appeals for the lbw, but he even if he hadn't edged it, this would have been outside the line;
50.5;?;Rampaul to Ponting, no run Ponting plays at this one, probably with the previous delivery in mind. This one moves in, but not as much as the previous one, and his outside edge is beaten;
50.4;?;Rampaul to Ponting, no run length ball outside off, Ponting leaves it alone. The ball swings in, Ponting has the stumps covered, but it hasn't done enough to hit the pad;
50.3;?;Rampaul to Ponting, no run length ball on off, driven on the up, but straight to mid-off;
50.2;?;Rampaul to Ponting, no run full, on off, driven to mid-on;
50.1;?;Rampaul to Ponting, no run short of a length, just outside off, punched to cover-point;
49.6;?;Shilling to Clarke, no run Did that not carry to backward short leg?. Turn and bounce, into the thigh pad area, hits the glove, lobs towards backward short leg, but falls short of Bravo. Shillingford looks like getting a wicket almost every ball;
49.5;?;Shilling to Clarke, no run short of a length, turning in towards middle, Clarke stays back to defend;
49.4;?;Shilling to Clarke, no run another forward-defensive, hits the inside half of the bat;
49.3;?;Shilling to Clarke, no run quick offbreak, defended to short leg;
49.2;?;Shilling to Clarke, no run what a ripper, the doosra. Clarke is drawn forward into defending this outside off, but the ball turns away ever so slightly, and jumps too. Beaten comprehensively;
49.1;2;Shilling to Clarke, 2 runs top-edge. Clarke premeditates the sweep, Shilly bowls short, gets turn and bounce, but it clears the leg gully rather easily;
48.6;?;Rampaul to Ponting, no run short of a length, on off, Ponting is forward to defend. Slightly awkward as this hits the bat high;
48.5;?;Rampaul to Ponting, no run good bouncer, only 132.4ks, but Ponting stayed interested in it until he realised this getting head high, and had to pull out;
48.4;?;Rampaul to Ponting, no run swinging in, late, could be reverse. Ponting does well to driven in front of off, to mid-on;
48.3;1;Rampaul to Clarke, 1 run short of a length, into the pads, pushed past midwicket;
48.2;2;Rampaul to Clarke, 2 runs full, swinging in, off-driven to the right of mid-off;
48.1;?;Rampaul to Clarke, no run short of a length, down leg, doesn't play at it;

Here's Ravi Rampaul. Wasim Akram in the mirror?
 Innings Start
Nearly a 100, the last two wickets adding for West Indies, but Australia's tail resisted even better, and their specialist batsmen did not cave in as early as West Indies' did. Chanderpaul fought but could not quite do a Wade. It means Australia have a 110-run lead, and will now look to bat West Indies out of the series
87.2;W;Starc to Chanderpaul, OUT that looks gone, that was shaping up to be an outswinger to the left-hander, it straightened in the air too from over the stumps after being angled in, Chanders cannot be blamed for pushing at the original line, but it then moves in after pitching on a good length on off, that would have crashed into middle, Chanders reviews umpire Erasmus' out call, he will have to walk back;Shivnarine Chanderpaul lbw b Starc 68 (238m 164b 3x4 0x6) SR: 41.46;

84.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Roach, no run away movement right away for Hilfenhaus, and an outside edge too, as he pitches it on middle, but the ball falls short of slip;

51.5;W;Starc to Chanderpaul, OUT full toss and ran into off side, oh they take a single...direct hit....surely gone! Yes, great work in the covers, Sammy's full length dive is not enough and West Indies slump again and what a silly way to give away another wicket, never a single on really;Daren Sammy run out (Cowan) 10 (34m 27b 0x4 0x6) SR: 37.03;

75.4;?;Shilling to Lyon, no run blocked off the front foot;
75.3;W;Shilling to Hilfenhaus, OUT tenth strike of the match for Shillingford, and what an outstanding take from silly point, it is Brathwaite, Shillingord gets it to take off alarmingly, hits the splice of the bat, the ball flies well to silly point's right, Brathwaite goes leaping and pouches it one-handed;Ben Hilfenhaus c Brathwaite b Shillingford 6 (6m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 120;

24.1;1;Shilling to Cowan, 1 run Roach could have probably made a better attempt at going for that top-edged sweep from Cowan, but in the end, it fell short of him as he ran to his right at deep square;

Jeremy: "I'm not sure useful swinging deliveries make up for a number 3 who's doing only a little better than Ponting before he was demoted." Give the man some time, I say
"Reminding of Watson... wasn't he under-utilised as a bowler in the first innings?" Jack, maybe they didn't need him in the first innings
 Innings Start
A grinning Mickey Arthur is out on the ground to welcome his players, a handshake and a hug for each of them after a job well done.
West Indies put up a solid fight through the series, rarely rolling over and pushing Australia in every match. 2-0 is a bit harsh on them, but their top-order has let them down all series, leaving their rock Shivnarine Chanderpaul too much to do. Kemar Roach had a terrific series, including a ten-for in the second Test, and Shane Shillingford marked his home Test with a ten-for of his own, wrestling the lead spinner's spot from Devendra Bishoo.
Jay from Australia: "It has to be remembered that 294 is actually a brilliant 4th innings score anywhere, and doesn't happen very often. Especially on a raging turner."
For Australia, there weren't too many big scores from the batsmen, the only century came from Matthew Wade, who has sparked off a debate on whether he has overtaken Haddin as Australia's No. 1 Test keeper. The lower order bailed them out on several occasions, and the depth of the fast bowling was on display again, as they barely felt the absence of Siddle and Pattinson, who both had to fly home injured after the second Test. Nathan Lyon was their highest wicket-taker and remains their frontline spinner ahead of a six-month break from Test cricket. That break will also raise questions over Ricky Ponting's future.
We're now set for the presentation ceremony.
Darren Sammy: has plenty of praise for the Dominica crowd. "We did a lot of good things in the series, we knew it was going to be tough against Australia, and they won the key moments. I think their lower-order gave us some trouble through the series. Proud of the guys as they showed the never-say-die spirit, and looked forward to improve. For the last year, our batting has been letting us down. The future looks good for West Indies, we just need to continue what we have been doing. I would also like to congratulate Michael Clarke and Australia."
Michael Clarke: "It's been a long summer, and today tops it off. It has been a lot of hard work, West Indies pushed us hard, they have come a long way under Darren and Ottis, I think West Indies cricket is on the rise. We probably didn't expect it to turn as much as it did in Dominica. It has been a great effort from the whole team, I think a lot of credit goes to young Matthew Wade, his century here won us the match." He also thanks the crowd that have turned out through the series to cheer the teams on.
Matthew Wade is the Man of the Match: "It was very difficult batting on this surface, the ball was turning big, and we weren't in a good situation. It was a lot of fun keeping as well on conditions which I am not used to, especially the amount of turn on offer."
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, to no one's surprise, is the Man of the Series. One of the biggest cheers of the day greets the announcement. "Not much I can say, very happy that I got some runs here last year and this year also, very pleased to be named citizen on Dominica (he has to pause as the crowd roars). It was difficult to bat for me, and for the Australian guys as well, they fought hard and the experience got them over the line, our young guys will learn from this tour."
Michael Clarke and the rest of the Australians come forward to collect the winner's medal. Then Clarke collects the winning cheque, before he is finally handed over the series trophy. He's taken well to this captaincy thing, hasn't he? Already has Test series wins in Sri Lanka and West Indies, besides the blanking of India over the summer.
Brydon Coverdale has today's report, while Dan Brettig will soon be sending in plenty of series analysis.
Thanks everyone for all the mails. This is Siddarth Ravindran signing out. Seeya!
96.3;W;Lyon to Sammy, OUT it's over, Australia take the series 2-0, Sammy is gone as he top-edges a sweep towards short fine leg, some merry hitting from the West Indian lower order but those two wickets late in the day had virtually killed off the Test, Sammy is distraught, discussing the shot even as he walks off after shaking hands with the Australians;Daren Sammy c Hilfenhaus b Lyon 61 (92m 51b 4x4 3x6) SR: 119.6;

95.1;?;Starc to Shilling, no run starts with a delivery just outside off, Shillingford is confident enough to leave that one;
94.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Sammy, no run a slower full toss way down the leg side, Sammy wasn't initially sure what to do with it, then looks to power it down towards fine leg, he doesn't connect, and is disappointed at missing out;
94.5;1;Hilfenhaus to Shilling, 1 run on the pads, tucked towards square leg for a single, Sammy gets only one ball to face, will he get a single;
94.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Shilling, no run short of length and angling in, Shillingford was cramped by that one, somehow manages to keep it away;

91.3;?;Harris to Shilling, no run pitched up this time and it is defended towards mid-off;

84.2;W;Lyon to Roach, OUT sensational catch from Clarke, a thin edge from Sammy as he looks to defend off the front foot, just past the keeper's pads, Clarke at first slip had a long way to go, it was travelling fast and it stayed low, Clarke threw himself to his left and somehow got there in time to pluck it before it thudded into the ground, Roach is gone;Kemar Roach c Clarke b Lyon 2 (15m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;

82.5;?;Lyon to Roach, no run referral for a bat pad, pitching just short of a length outside off and Lyon gets that dramatic turn again, that spins past the bat and strikes Roach on high on flap of the pad, then the back thigh pad and towards Clarke at first slip, certainly not bat-pad, and looks too high to be lbw, actually Roach was struck outside off, so Roach survives;
82.4;3;Lyon to Sammy, 3 runs dangerous strategy from Sammy, cutting the ball off the back foot when it is spinning sharply in, doesn't go all the way to the rope, three more for sammy;

81.1;4;Clarke to Sammy, FOUR runs Sammy has only one gear, Clarke has been dropping it too short in the past few overs, Sammy has time to wait on the back foot and batter that towards midwicket;

80.4;W;Lyon to Baugh, OUT Lyon strikes, the end of Baugh, he was attempting another big hit, he didn't get forward and he looked to swipe it, connected well but placement isn't great, Ponting at midwicket holds on to a tough overhead chance, he hasn't had the best series fielding-wise, but pouches that well;Carlton Baugh c Ponting b Lyon 12 (36m 38b 0x4 0x6) SR: 31.57;

76.3;?;Lyon to Sammy, no run defended off the backfoot;

74.6;?;Lyon to Sammy, no run there is a big appeal for a bat-pad first up as Sammy looks to defend off the front foot, short leg takes the catch after the ball loops up, umpire is convinced that came only off the front pad and not the bat, the Australians are too, and they don't review;
74.5;1;Lyon to Baugh, 1 run driven firmly towards mid-on for a single;

73.6;W;Clarke to Deonarine, OUT full delivery from Clarke, seemed an innocuous delivery, punched back towards the bowler, the Australians appeal after Clarke catches, a very gentle appeal, the umpires consult and then decide to go to the third umpire, a huge puff of dust as the ball bounces, quite hard to tell even on several replays whether that bounced before hitting the bat, I think that pitched before Deonarine hit it, the third umpire Ian Gould taking a long time over it, and Gould has ruled that out, Clarke gets his fourth, and West Indies' last remaining specialist batsman is gone;Narsingh Deonarine c & b Clarke 13 (39m 44b 1x4 0x6) SR: 29.54;
73.5;?;Clarke to Deonarine, no run heading for off and middle, defended to the off side;
73.4;1;Clarke to Baugh, 1 run shorter and pitching just outside off, once again it turns away to give Baugh width, he slaps it towards sweeper cover;

73.2;1;Clarke to Deonarine, 1 run driven towards mid-off for a single;

71.4;1;Clarke to Deonarine, 1 run width provided, Deonarine chops it towards cover for a single, his first run of the day;
71.3;?;Clarke to Deonarine, no run length ball, Deonarine charges down and looks to defend, hit on the pads outside off;
71.2;?;Clarke to Deonarine, no run short of length and outside off, not turning in much, defended towards cover;
71.1;1;Clarke to Baugh, 1 run short and spinning away, too wide and that is slapped towards deep point for a single, plenty of bouncer on offer for Clarke;
70.6;?;Lyon to Deonarine, no run looks to sweep powerfully this time, not sure whether that came off the bat, he certainly didn't connect well, the ball loops over Cown at short leg, who wasn't certain where exactly the ball was;
70.5;?;Lyon to Deonarine, no run sends this on leg stump, spinning back, defended from the crease;
70.4;?;Lyon to Deonarine, no run blocked to the leg side this time;

70.1;?;Lyon to Baugh, no run spins in from well outside off, short of length, worked behind square leg by Baugh;
69.6;?;Clarke to Deonarine, no run on length turning in from off, defended from the crease to end the over;
69.5;?;Clarke to Deonarine, no run;
69.4;?;Clarke to Deonarine, no run big turn for Clarke here, that was a short ball that the batsman wanted to hammer to midwicket, too early into the shot, struck on the thigh pad;
69.3;?;Clarke to Deonarine, no run mildly adventurous from the batsman, charging down to punch the ball towards mid-off;
69.2;?;Clarke to Deonarine, no run length ball outside off is blocked off the front foot;
69.1;1;Clarke to Baugh, 1 run full and on the pads, clipped towards midiwcket, and Baugh gets off the mark, it is the first run of the day as well;
68.6;?;Lyon to Deonarine, no run end of a terrific over from Lyon, spins away outside off, he's going to be tricky to deal with today;
68.5;?;Lyon to Deonarine, no run slightly shorter and turning away, the batsman wanted to smother it off the front foot, past the outside edge, Wade whips off the bails but the batsman's back foot is in;
68.4;?;Lyon to Deonarine, no run defended solidly this time towards the bowler;
68.3;?;Lyon to Deonarine, no run spinning sharply outside off and that is left alone;
68.2;?;Lyon to Deonarine, no run;
68.1;?;Lyon to Deonarine, no run a good start for Lyon, tossed up ball pitching on leg stump and turning away, off the leading edge and off wide of first slip, loud cries of 'Catch';

67.5;?;Clarke to Baugh, no run punched with a bit more force towards extra cover;
67.4;?;Clarke to Baugh, no run strides forward and defends towards cover;

67.2;?;Clarke to Baugh, no run Clarke flights the first delivery of the day, pushed towards point off the front foot;
67.1;W;Clarke to Chanderpaul, OUT turn and there's a cry for leg before, was he outside the line, not out, they will refer this, could be high too, certainly caught Chanderpaul on the crease, the turn beat the inside edge...oh! Three reds this is out! What a blow! I think Clarke has just sealed the Test match in the last over of the day. It caught Chanderpaul in line with off stump, going on to hit middle;Shivnarine Chanderpaul lbw b Clarke 69 (179m 122b 6x4 0x6) SR: 56.55;

60.6;W;Watson to Bravo, OUT gone! There's the breakthrough, sliding across Bravo, he's tried to back foot drive and got an edge low to Wade who's got down to take well, that is a good catch. So Australia do strike before the close, what a bonus, six to take now and they'll be feeling so much better to have ended that excellent stand;Darren Bravo c ?Wade b Watson 45 (176m 148b 5x4 0x6) SR: 30.4;
