Data
Australia have done well to dismiss New Zealand for 218 after losing the toss. McGrath was impeccable with figures of 3 for 24 off his ten overs. Clark was more expensive but he did pick up four important wickets. McMillan led the way for New Zealand with 89 off 87 balls and it was his effort that took New Zealand to a score they can hope to defend if they bowl well. I'll be back in half an hour for the Australian chase. Do join me then.

Welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the fifth match of the Commonwealth Bank series at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Australia are pitted against New Zealand who a under a wee bit of pressure after England beat them by three wickets at Hobart. I'm George Binoy and I'll be bringing you the excitement as it unfolds.
As it stands, Australia are miles ahead of everyone else with three wins out of three, England have one win and New Zealand have lost both their games so far. In terms of points, Australia are on 14 (they earned a few bonuses), England on four and New Zealand on nought.
Toss: New Zealand have won the toss and will bat. I'll have the team news shortly ...
Australia: Matthew Hayden, Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Andrew Symonds, Michael Hussey, Cameron White, Brett Lee, Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clark, Glenn McGrath
New Zealand 1 Brendon McCullum (wk), 2 Nathan Astle, 3 Stephen Fleming (capt), 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Peter Fulton, 6 Craig McMillan, 7 Hamish Marshall, 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 James Franklin, 10 Mark Gillespie, 11 Michael Mason
Australia have made two changes. Ricky Ponting returns to lead the side which means Brad Hodge, who failed with the bat but took two outstanding catches against England, misses out. Stuart Clark replaces Mitchell Johnson.
Two changes for New Zealand as well. Shane Bond is obviously not playing because of his injury, Michael Mason replaces him. New Zealand have also strengthened their batting by playing Hamish Marshall for Jeetan Patel.
The word on the pitch is that it's a pretty decent one for batting. Bowling first in the hot conditions in Sydney won't be fun either so all in all a good toss to win. Whether New Zealand make it count, that remains to be seen ...
Nathan Astle and Stephen Fleming are New Zeland's openers. Brett Lee has the new ball and he's steaming in from over the wicket to Fleming. Two slips in place ...
 Innings Start
How many times have we seen Hussey do a Bevan now? His superb innings seals Australia's spot in the final. Credit to New Zealand for fighting as hard as they did. McMillan set the match up with a belligerent 89 but New Zealand could have done with a few more runs. Australia's chase started poorly - they lost their first three wickets for 17 but Clarke and Hussey played gritty innings to seal Australia's victory.
Thank you for tuning into Cricinfo's live coverage of today's game. We'll be back on Tuesday when England take on New Zealand at Adelaide. That will be a crucial match for New Zealand who haven't picked up any points so far. Do join us then. Cheers!

We're moments away from the start of Australia's reply. New Zealand have taken the field as have Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. Australia need 219 to win at 4.38 runs per over. The start will be crucial. England took early wickets against Australia on Friday and gave them a real scare. Michael Mason too will want cheap wickets with the new ball. He's bowling from over the wicket to Gilchrist with two slips in place.
