6.10pm What an action-packed innings. Warner sprinted to a half-century off 35 balls. He wasn't done yet; he then raised his century off 98 balls. Steven Smith eased his way to 49, Head shellacked a 35-ball fifty, Maxwell went one better with a 34-ball fifty, studded by several trademark trick shots. Hasan Ali claimed his maiden five-for in ODIs, but Pakistan's fielding was the major talking point. Drops, fumbles, overthrows, what not! - they simply out-Pakistan'd themselves. Now, they need 354 - the highest successful chase on Australian soil - to stay alive in the series
The last time they chased down 300 or more, Sarfraz Ahmed led the way. He isn't available today. Who will step up today? Join me back in 40 minutes or thereabouts to find out.
Mazher Arshad tweets: "Hasan Ali's five-for is also the first five-wicket haul of the tour by either team (including Tests)"
49.6;W;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, OUT Sharjeel hangs onto a dolly, and Hasan does the sajdah, celebrating his maiden five-for. His figures of 5 for 52 stand out amid this carnage. Very full and outside off, Maxwell flits around in the crease and shovel-whips it in the air. Sharjeel takes it at deep square leg. He did not even have to budge;Glenn Maxwell c Sharjeel Khan b Hasan Ali 78 (70m 44b 10x4 1x6) SR: 177.27;
49.5;4;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, FOUR runs very, very full on middle, Maxwell steps away outside leg and hoists it straight of mid-off. Don't bother chasing from long-on, Malik. Thuds into the straight boundary;
49.4;4;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, FOUR runs full and outside off, Maxwell pre-meditated, shuffling across off, and shovel-whipping it in the air fine of a diving short fine leg;
49.3;2;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 2 runs banged in on middle and leg, flat-batted away to deep square leg;
49.2;4;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, FOUR runs Another mishap in the field. Malik now lets it through his legs to the long-on boundary. Short of a length, Maxwell, having shuffled around in the crease, swats it to long-on;
49.1;W;Hasan Ali to Wade, OUT Skied to long-on. Chest-high catch, Imad Wasim clings onto it.... just It nearly popped out at the last moment. Pitched up and outside off, right in the hitting slot. Wade lofts and miscues it to Imad. Fourth wicket for Hasan;Matthew Wade c Imad Wasim b Hasan Ali 5 (13m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33;
48.6;4;Junaid to Maxwell, FOUR runs flays it away to the right of mid-off. Azhar dishes out a dive, if that's any consolation. Maxwell backs away outside leg, meets a full ball outside off and flat-bats it away with fierce power;
48.5;4;Junaid to Maxwell, FOUR runs wide yorker, Maxwell does well to reach out. He does even better to carve it away square through point;

46.4;1;Amir to Maxwell, 1 run yorker on off, jammed out to mid-on;
46.3;W;Amir to Head, OUT Phew, Pakistan finally hang onto a catch (yes, you read that right). Head pre-meditates, ventures a long way outside leg. He is chased by a short ball, which gets big. Attempts a hook and skies a top-edge to Malik at deep square leg;Travis Head c Shoaib Malik b Mohammad Amir 51 (55m 36b 2x4 4x6) SR: 141.66;
46.2;6;Amir to Head, SIX runs Head brings up the century stand and his fifty with one blow: smear over midwicket. Uses his feet, meets a short ball, and dumps it over the leg-side boundary;
46.1;4;Amir to Head, FOUR runs full and wide outside off, backs away and carves it through the covers;
45.6;1;Junaid to Head, 1 run yorker on leg stump, jammed out to square leg.;
45.5;2;Junaid to Head, 2 runs Head is floored. Wide full ball outside off, reaches out and slices it away to short third man. Hasan Ali fires it miles over the head of Rizwan. Wild, wild throw. Horror fielding. Mickey Arthur can't watch this horror show. He covers up his face in his hands;
45.4;6;Junaid to Head, SIX runs length ball outside off, Head parcels it up and dispatches it several rows beyond the midwicket boundary. Smeared off the middle of the bat. Raises the 300 for Australia;

45.2;2;Junaid to Maxwell, 2 runs full-toss on middle and leg, whipped away to deep midwicket;
45.1;1;Junaid to Head, 1 run full on middle and leg, near yorker, whipped through midwicket;

44.4;4;Amir to Maxwell, FOUR runs Azhar runs across to his left, dives to his left from mid-off, and only finger-tips this away. Amir is down on his knees. Poor, Amir. Poor, Pakistan bowlers. But this was a very difficult chance. Sliced away in the air and Head gets away;
44.3;1;Amir to Head, 1 run Head moves away outside leg stump, this is short and following the batsman. Skied over midwicket to wide long-on;
44.2;1lb;Amir to Maxwell, 1 leg bye;
44.1;4;Amir to Maxwell, FOUR runs back of a length and outside off, Maxwell sinks his teeth into it and swings it nice and clean over the bowler's head. Bisecting mid-on and mid-off;
43.6;2;Junaid to Head, 2 runs Dropped, Sharjeel is the culprit again. What are you doing Pakistan? Are you trying to out-Pakistan yourselves? Possibly a slower ball, full on middle and leg, Head miscues it in the air. Sharjeel lazily runs to his right from long-on. The ball pops in and pops out. The Pakistan fans in the stands can't believe it. Regulation catch;
43.5;?;Junaid to Head, no run very full and outside off, swerves back into the left-hander. He attempts another leg-side club and manages an inside edge onto the pad. The ball rolls away to the off side, adjacent to his boot;

43.2;1;Junaid to Head, 1 run low full-toss on off, belted back to Junaid with some force. Too harsh to call it a drop. Junaid was caught between taking evasive action and stopping the ball. He does a bit of both and saves three in the end;
43.1;?;Junaid to Head, no run slower offcutter outside off, 116.7ks, Head slogs early, loses his shape, and does not make contact;

42.1;1lb;Amir to Maxwell, 1 leg bye back of a length and skids on, 142ks, Maxwell attempts a fancy shovel-whip, and is rapped high on the thigh. Pitched outside leg, probably;

41.5;1;Hafeez to Maxwell, 1 run Maxwell pre-meditates for a reverse-sweep. This is a waist-high full-toss outside leg. Dragged to midwicket rather than middled;

37.5;?;Hasan Ali to Head, no run good length outside off, slight movement away, beats the outside edge as he tries to drive this;
37.4;5lb;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 5 leg byes 139 kph, oh dear. It was lovely yorker, rapped him on the pads and rolled to the right of slip, who has a needless shy at the stump. The bowler is walking back lazily and makes no attempt at stopping this, and it's four overthrows through mid-on;
37.3;?;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, no run oh geez! Dreadful shot. Good length, wide outside off, and I'm not even sure he knows where he wanted to hit this. Was still walking into it as he swung his bat at it. Well beaten.;

35.5;W;Hasan Ali to Smith, OUT he's got him! Good length outside off, tails in, he walks across and is trapped in front. Smith reviews. No bat involved. That's out.

35.4;1;Hasan Ali to Head, 1 run edged! Full and swings slightly away from outside off, he goes for the big cover drive and edges it through the third slip region;
35.3;W;Hasan Ali to Warner, OUT ....so of course he goes now. Full and wide outside off, he's backed away too much and falls over as he reaches for this.

32.2;?;Imad Wasim to Warner, no run Dropped! Back of a length on middle, goes back and tries to cream it to the right of Hasan Ali at mid-on, but he gets it high on the bat and it floats to him. He goes slowly, low to his right, and falls over as he tries to take it and it's down;
32.1;2;Imad Wasim to Warner, 2 runs flat, full at middle, clears his front foot and squeezes it to the left of deep cover;
31.6;?;Amir to Smith, no run big appeal and they've reviewed it slower ball, pitching on a good length at what looks like middle, he walks across the stumps and tries to turn it into the leg side, trapped in front of off stump. Amir was the only one appealing. Not out. That was close. No edge on it, pitched in line and deviated just enough to hit him marginally outside off, which means it's umpire's call;

23.4;1;Junaid to Smith, 1 run dropped. Full and angled wide outside off, he chops at it and it flies to Sharjeel at knee height at backward point, and he's put in a lazy one hand out at this and put it down. Dismal effort.;

Only two spinners - Mohammad Hafeez being one - have bowled the first over of an ODI match in Australia! Can you name the other?
The Hafeez punt did not work. Here is Junaid. Over the wicket with a slip in
 Innings Start
David Warner, Man of the Match: It's the home crowd, absolutely love playing here. I was quite slow tonight, but it's always special to put the boys in a great position. I probably made the catch look better. It is always good to take a great catch in the outfield.
Azhar Ali: Always tough to chase 354. In the field we missed the opportunities. It was below par, and that allowed Australia to score that amount of runs. David Warner started well. If we would have held our chances, we would have restricted them to lesser. It was a good pitch, 300 was chaseable. Against the new ball is the best way to score runs. Around 300 was chaseable, we leaked too many runs in the first half. We have a lot to play for Adelaide. We will come hard try to win the game, and finish the series on a high.
Steven Smith: Yeah, it was a good performance. We started well with the bat. David Warner was outstanding with the bat, Maxwell was outstanding, as was Head. The bowlers then backed it up. The wicket did not change much. Probably winning four tosses at a wrong time, I hope I have some luck in India as well. Australia Day is an exciting time of the year; that was almost a complete package barring a couple of errors in the field. Hopefully, we can back it up on Australia Day.
Maxwell: It was very much a convincing performance. With bat and ball we were outstanding. It wasn't a great wicket, it was slow and low. We batted on a similar wicket in the World Cup two years ago. I just hit the gaps, and I know my game is to chip the infield and hit boundaries. That partnership with Head was special and we have done it a few times together. I just wanted to get it [reverse slog-sweep] over the infield. Luckily I got it off the middle and it went for a six. I just wanted to clear 30 metres.
That is all we have for you from this game. Looking forward to your company on Australia Day for the last ODI. Goodbye and good night from myself, Varun, and Raghav.
9.50pm The celebrations begin in Australia's camp. Sharjeel Khan set off like a freight train, but the spinners - Zampa and Head - derailed him and Pakistan. Zampa showed off his range: donkey drops, quick arm-balls, and straighter ones among others. Malik and Hafeez mounted a fightback, but Pakistan did not have enough firepower in their lower middle order.
Australia's win though was set up by their batsmen - Warner hammered a hundred off 98 balls, his first against Pakistan in ODIs, Head and Maxwell then shellacked half-centuries to supercharge their team to 353. Pakistan's multiple goof-ups in the field allowed Australia to rack up a hefty total. Ultimately, it proved 86 too many for the visitors.
43.5;W;Hazlewood to Junaid, OUT Australia beat Pakistan by 86 runs and sew up the series. Junaid bags a first-ball duck. Full and swerves in slightly, breaches Junaid's defences and hits the off stump;Junaid Khan b Hazlewood 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

36.4;W;Starc to Umar Akmal, OUT Pat Cummins calmly settles under the skier. Two wickets in two overs right after drinks. Starc digs it short and outside off. Slower bouncer.

35.6;1;Head to Umar Akmal, 1 run tossed on the leg stump, knocked through square leg;
35.5;W;Head to Malik, OUT Warner simply loves the SCG. He runs in from deep midwicket, attacks the ball, and pockets a low catch. Excellent judgement. He then turns back towards the crowd, lets out a roar, and thumps his chest. He enjoyed that catch. That's how you do it, Pakistan.
