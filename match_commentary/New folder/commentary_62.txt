Data
There's a feeling of deja vu from Pakistan. An innings based around a good century, this time from Mohammad Rizwan, but that falls short of 300. It's a decent total, but far from overwhelming. They will have to bowl and field well. Australia will certainly take it having lost Jhye Richardson after five of his overs to a shoulder injury. Aaron Finch bowling 10 overs for 41 was a massive bonus. Liam will be back with you for the start of the chase at 7.15pm.

49.5;1;Stoinis to Imad Wasim, 1 run another slower short ball, swatted to deep midwicket;
49.4;4;Stoinis to Imad Wasim, FOUR runs and now he finds the gap wide of mid-off! Gave himself a fraction of room, was a low full toss, driven through the in-field;

48.4;W;Coulter-Nile to Faheem, OUT finds long-on! Coulter-Nile may have got away with this, was in the slot, Faheem was eyeing up another six over long-on but could get the distance. The bat twisted in his hand;Faheem Ashraf c Handscomb b Coulter-Nile 14 (14b 1x4 1x6) SR: 100;
48.3;6;Coulter-Nile to Faheem, SIX runs back of a length, and launched into the stands! That's more like it from Faheem, uses his power to muscle this over long-on;

46.4;W;Coulter-Nile to Rizwan, OUT brilliantly done by Maxwell on the boundary if he's stayed inside the rope...A full delivery lofted down the ground towards long-on, Maxwell back-tracking towards the boundary, gets underneath it, knows his momentum is going to take him over the rope, throws the ball back inside but has his heel touched the boundary? This is very tight, the replays aren't the best angles. Third umpire says he can't see any movement of the boundary marker. This will be out.;Mohammad Rizwan c Maxwell b Coulter-Nile 115 (126b 11x4 0x6) SR: 91.26;

45.5;4;Lyon to Faheem, FOUR runs just over slip! He brings out the reverse sweep, goes much finer than he wanted, slip leaps in the air but can't quite get there;

42.5;4;Zampa to Malik, FOUR runs dropped at long-on by Maxwell! Malik used his feet, clubbed this straight of long-on, so Maxwell had to make some ground, it was a low chance and he couldn't hold on;

 Innings Start
10.43pm A fifth ODI win in a row for Australia, and Aaron Finch leads from the front once again with a career-best 153 not out as his team equal the record for the highest successful run chase at this ground. The result is eerily similar to that in the first ODI - again, Pakistan were a good 20 to 30 runs short, and Australia cruise home to win by eight wickets.
ABAE: "Letting Aaron Finch bowl 10 overs was a big issue here, let along with economy at which he did" -- Letting him score 153 also didn't help
"The game ebbed and flowed, and our partnership ebbed and flowed a bit too," says Usman Khawaja, who shared in a 209-run stand with Finch. "I got off with a bit of a flow while Finch was struggling to get it away, and then he started middling it. To win the first two games was really important as we know Pakistan are strong in these conditions. When you get a partnership, you have to make it count as it's hard for the new batsman coming in."
"To be honest, I think early strikes in our bowling is what we are lacking," says Shoaib Malik. "Overall, there are positives as we fought until the last ball. We are testing our bench strength. There are youngsters who we are giving chances to. Rizwan has scored runs in that position, and it's a great sign that someone is knocking on the door for the World Cup team. Since we have rested a lot of our players, we are trying other players and these things happen in international cricket, especially when you are playing a big team. Since I have this opportunity, I must also congratulate Finch on back to back hundreds. If an opener scores 150+, it's tough to win that game. Next game, there will be more youngsters in the playing XI. It's not about winning the series, it's about testing our bench strength."
Aaron Finch is the Player of the Match
"On a wicket like that, you can't afford to take it too deep with new batters," says Finch. "When you come in, it's tough to quickly at first. I just wanted to get through Imad. He comes in and challenges the stumps and your pads. It's hard to take a risk off him. I just hung in there as long as I could. Usman has been in good form, and he's getting big runs at an important time. Things are going quite well at the moment, but there are always things to improve."
"He's in good spirits," Finch says of Jhye Richardson, who dislocated his shoulder in the field earlier. "His shoulder popped out a little bit. Unfortunate for the youngster. He'll get home, have some scans and assess the damage."

47.1;6;Faheem to Finch, SIX runs spanked straight back down the ground, and Finch equals his highest score in ODI cricket;
46.6;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 run pitched right up at a shade over 145km/h, and Finch drives straight to cover. They take on Haris Sohail in the position for a single, and Finch wasn't even in the frame as the throw came in ... but again it goes wide!;

46.2;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Marsh, 1 run short, and it's pulled just wide of mid on. Haris Sohail is in position there, and he has a shy but misses. There have been a few nervy runs in the last few minutes;

45.5;2;Faheem to Finch, 2 runs just short of Yasir in the deep! Finch goes on the attack now, lifting a length ball over the leg side. He doesn't connect well, but that actually saves him as Yasir can't get in off the midwicket boundary in time to catch it - though he stops the boundary;
45.4;1;Faheem to Marsh, 1 run in the air, but safe! Marsh looks to pull in the air, but it rushes on to him and loops off the splice ... but falls safely at mid on! If long on had been up, that would have been the simplest of catches;

45.2;1;Faheem to Finch, 1 run chipped uppishly into the leg side, and again midwicket cuts it off but they take him on for a quick single. The throw goes wide.

45.1;?;Faheem to Finch, no run seaming in off a length, and Finch can't get it past midwicket;
44.6;?;Mohammad Hasnain to Marsh, no run direct hit would have had him! Marsh taps to point and sets off. Finch sends him back, but he's slow to turn, and had the throw been accurate, he would have been out. Tough chance, just the one stump to aim at for Imam;

41.3;1;Faheem to Finch, 1 run pushed through the gap at extra cover for one;
41.2;W;Faheem to Maxwell, OUT direct hit, and Maxwell walks off straight away, even as the umpire sends it upstairs. He pushed to mid off and set off for what would have been a tight single, had the throw not been deadly accurate to find him short. He just hit it and set off, but Haris Sohail's throw was sharp and on target. Replays simply confirm his demise;Glenn Maxwell run out (Haris Sohail) 19 (15b 0x4 2x6) SR: 126.66;

26.2;?;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, no run back of a length at middle and off, 143kph, pushed towards mid-off...jarring the splice;

25.6;?;Faheem to Khawaja, no run driven off the back foot to cover;
25.5;?;Faheem to Khawaja, no run back of a length outside off, defended to point;
25.4;2;Faheem to Khawaja, 2 runs moves across the crease again, whips it from outside off through square leg, lovely timing, and Shan Masood does very well in the deep to prevent the boundary;
25.3;?;Faheem to Khawaja, no run back of a length outside off, played into backward point;
25.2;?;Faheem to Khawaja, no run gets beaten as this bounces a touch more from back of a length, climbs over the top edge as he aims to drive;
25.1;2;Faheem to Khawaja, 2 runs round the wicket, short of a length, Khawaja gets inside the line and flicks it fine of long leg...Yasir Shah races around, dives and tries to flick it back. And, actually, the third umpire rules he just kept it in;
24.6;?;Haris Sohail to Finch, no run plays forward and nudges to midwicket;
24.5;1;Haris Sohail to Khawaja, 1 run gets across to off stump and plays a bottom-handed whip to long-on;
24.4;?;Haris Sohail to Khawaja, no run fuller, pushed back to the bowler;

21.5;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run full at the stumps, defended;
21.4;1;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, 1 run round the wicket, whipped off the pads to deep square and that's another fifty for Khawaja;

21.2;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run dabbed from outside off to short third man;
21.1;4;Imad Wasim to Finch, FOUR runs that's a heave, but an effective heave, runs to the midwicket rope despite coming off not much more than a think inside edge as he went for a big drive;
21.1;1w;Imad Wasim to Finch, 1 wide round the wicket, fired down the leg side;
20.6;1;Haris Sohail to Finch, 1 run short outside off, cracked down to long-off;
20.5;?;Haris Sohail to Finch, no run pushes a full delivery back to the bowler;
20.4;?;Haris Sohail to Finch, no run full at middle and leg, plays forward and it runs off an inside edge to midwicket;
20.3;?;Haris Sohail to Finch, no run angled into the pads, he can't get it away;
20.2;1;Haris Sohail to Khawaja, 1 run bottom hand takes over this time and he drags it down to long-on;
20.1;?;Haris Sohail to Khawaja, no run round the wicket, pushed across and beats the outside edge as Khawaja is a little lazy with his push;
19.6;6;Yasir Shah to Finch, SIX runs and now he goes over the leg side, that's an even better shot, an effortless pick-up off his pads which has sailed into the stands at deep midwicket. What a difference a few weeks makes;
19.5;?;Yasir Shah to Finch, no run full, gets forward and defends;
19.4;6;Yasir Shah to Finch, SIX runs that's huge, onto the roof...Finch opens his shoulders, launches it straight down the ground. Didn't use his feet, stayed in the crease, just swung through the line;
19.3;4;Yasir Shah to Finch, FOUR runs dragged down short outside off, driven off the back foot and placed excellently wide of long-off;
19.2;1;Yasir Shah to Khawaja, 1 run full outside leg, swept behind square, was in the air for a little while;

18.3;1;Haris Sohail to Finch, 1 run driven along the ground to long-off;
18.2;4;Haris Sohail to Finch, FOUR runs uses his feet and crunches this straight down the ground, handsome way for Finch to reach his fifty. Also the century stand;

17.1;?;Yasir Shah to Finch, no run pushes a good-length delivery to cover;

16.5;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 run Hasnain reverts to the bouncer at 143km/h, but Finch is expecting this one, waiting on the back foot to pull into the leg side;
16.4;4;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, FOUR runs pitched up outside off, and Hasnain finds a hint of shape in through the air, but Finch likes it in his half and he just swings through the line to send it straight back where it came from;
16.3;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, 1 run worked off the pads down to fine leg;
16.2;1b;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 bye dug in short, the ball loops over a ducking batsman but it's not stopped cleanly behind the stumps;
16.1;4;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, FOUR runs slugged wide of mid on, Finch seizing on one that's pitched up to him and muscling it into - and through - the leg side;
15.6;?;Yasir Shah to Khawaja, no run beaten outside off by one that just zips straight across him;
15.5;1;Yasir Shah to Finch, 1 run slider on off stump. Finch backs away and exposes his stumps, but puts bat to ball to find another single through cover;
15.4;1;Yasir Shah to Khawaja, 1 run Khawaja skips out to get close to a legbreak, working with the spin to find a single to short fine leg;
15.3;1;Yasir Shah to Finch, 1 run too short this time, and Finch hangs back to place a shot out to the sweeper;
15.2;?;Yasir Shah to Finch, no run ripping off a good, full length, Finch defending to cover;
15.1;6;Yasir Shah to Finch, SIX runs biffed over long on! There's a fielder in place down there, but Finch takes him on with a thump down the ground. He hits it hard, and not too high but far enough to beat a leaping fielder at the boundary's edge;
14.6;?;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, no run on a length and straight at 142.4km/h, Khawaja pushing to cover;
14.5;?;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, no run nippy bouncer at 141km/h, Khawaja ducking quickly under it. Hasnain wanders down after following through to eye-ball the batsman. It wasn't actually all that short, and not called a bouncer by the umpire;
14.4;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 run rising off a length at 141.6km/h, but there's a little width for Finch to work with and a he finds a single to the sweeper;
14.3;?;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, no run skidding in to him at 142km/h, and Finch's glance is stopped at square leg;
14.2;?;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, no run ouch! Finch is almost beaten again by a short-ish ball that rushes on to his pull, taking the inside edge and striking him in the midriff;
14.1;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, 1 run flicked off his pads and through midwicket for one;
13.6;1;Yasir Shah to Khawaja, 1 run tapped back past a diving bowler, another single;
13.5;1;Yasir Shah to Finch, 1 run Finch goes back and across and works a straight one through mid on;

13.3;?;Yasir Shah to Khawaja, no run Khawaja stays deep and works with the spin into the leg side;
13.2;1;Yasir Shah to Finch, 1 run a little too short, and he's thumped out to the cover sweeper;
13.1;?;Yasir Shah to Finch, no run fizzing legbreak to start, and there's some spin straight away, the ball kissing the outside edge and rolling through gully;
12.6;?;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, no run and he hits a full length on off stump to finish, Khawaja watchfully seeing him off;
12.5;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 run again Finch is late on the pull as a bouncer arrives at over 146km/h, splicing the shot tamely in the air but into space on the leg side. That's definitely hurried him;
12.4;4;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, FOUR runs plenty of pace once again, but not enough direction as this one is fired down the leg side. Has Finch got bat on it? Looks like it's given as runs;
12.3;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, 1 run for the umpteenth time, Khawaja angles his bat and works it to third man;
12.2;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 run testing bouncer! It seemed too quick for Finch at 146.9km/h, the ball skidding on to him and hitting him on the helmet before he was halfway into his pull. The ball hits him flush on the peak. He's fine, but he might need a new helmet out there. And there's a short delay as one is brought out to him;
12.1;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, 1 run Khawaja hops and whips off his hip to find a single through square leg;
11.6;?;Faheem to Finch, no run just short of a full length, outside off, and the ball comes off the inside half of the bat and rolls to midwicket;
11.5;?;Faheem to Finch, no run the bowler pulls his length back in response to the last shot, Finch pushing to cover;
11.4;4;Faheem to Finch, FOUR runs Finch doesn't bother moving his feet much, but lets his bottom hand lead the shot to power the ball up and over cover. Too full from Faheem, and there was some width;
11.3;?;Faheem to Finch, no run a hint of seam movement in to Finch, who pushes to mid on;
11.2;1;Faheem to Khawaja, 1 run Khawaja angles his bat and turns the strike over with a single to third man;
11.1;?;Faheem to Khawaja, no run Khawaja drives back past the bowler, but mid on sprints around and dives to cut it off;
10.6;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, 1 run Khawaja thrusts his hands out at a delivery outside off at 147.4km/h, guiding a single to third man;
10.5;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 run Hasnain finds some tail in through the air at close to 142km/h, and there's half an appeal as an inside edge bounces off Finch's pad into the leg side;
10.4;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, 1 run angled across Khawaja, who jabs late to find a single to third man;
10.3;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Finch, 1 run Hasnain steams in and hits a length at 146.2km/h, Finch forcing him away through point for a single;
10.2;1;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, 1 run rising off a length, just outside off, and Khawaja angles his bat to find a single near point;
10.1;?;Mohammad Hasnain to Khawaja, no run Hasnain charges in off a long run up and starts with a bristling bouncer at almost 143km/h, Khawaja's knees buckling under him as he ducks to get out of the way;
9.6;?;Faheem to Finch, no run pushed into the off side, and again he can't beat the field;
9.5;?;Faheem to Finch, no run just short of Imad! Finch has struggled to penetrate the cover region, so he tries to go over it, but mis-hits his drive. It flies in the air, but dips and drops short of Imad at mid off;
9.4;1;Faheem to Khawaja, 1 run flicked softly into the leg side, where some sleepy fielding allows a run. Slight misfield from Haris Sohail;
9.3;?;Faheem to Khawaja, no run chopped down to gully. Finch charges out at the non-striker's end, but Khawaja sends him back with a loud "no!";
9.2;1lb;Faheem to Finch, 1 leg bye there's a stifled appeal as the ball comes off the pad, but it's headed well down the leg side;
9.1;?;Faheem to Finch, no run Faheem keeps it just short of a good length, Finch pressing to cover;
8.6;4;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, FOUR runs powered through cover, the two fielders in that region just looking at the ball and then at each other as the ball flies between them and away to the rope. No-one moved;
8.5;1;Imad Wasim to Finch, 1 run tapped softly towards midwicket, and they steal a quick single before the fielder can get to it;
8.4;1;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, 1 run Khawaja lets his wrists do the work, and finds a single to long on;
8.3;1;Imad Wasim to Finch, 1 run this one is straighter, but he's worked through square leg to turn the strike over;
8.2;4;Imad Wasim to Finch, FOUR runs width, and it's punished! Imad had done such a good job of cramping Finch for room, but this is short and wide and Finch puts it away through point - importantly, he also placed it into the gap;
8.1;1;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, 1 run flicked off his toes and through midwicket;
7.6;?;Faheem to Finch, no run Finch stands tall and looks to power one through cover, but yet again picks out the fielder;
7.5;?;Faheem to Finch, no run Faheem aims full at 134km/h, and it keeps a little low but Finch keeps it out;
7.4;?;Faheem to Finch, no run Finch pushes at this one even more forcefully, but it's another dot as he can't get it through a packed off side field;
7.3;?;Faheem to Finch, no run Finch spots some width and punches outside off, but finds point;
7.2;1;Faheem to Khawaja, 1 run Khawaja waits on a late cut to find a single to third man;
7.1;?;Faheem to Khawaja, no run and he hits a length outside off at 131km/h to start, Khawaja pushing to point;
6.6;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run Imad attacks the stumps, and it's dead-batted back at him;
6.5;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run a full length draws Finch forward, but he can only push softly to cover;
6.4;1;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, 1 run speared in full at 96.7km/h, and it's tapped down to long on;
6.3;?;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, no run Khawaja looks for a drop and run single, but point is in too quickly;
6.2;?;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, no run Khawaja drives at one drifting across him, pinging mid off;
6.1;1;Imad Wasim to Finch, 1 run Finch nurdles off his pads and doesn't beat short fine, but Khawaja calls him through for a quick single;
5.6;?;Abbas to Khawaja, no run much better from Abbas, aiming for the top of off, and Khawaja defends;
5.5;4;Abbas to Khawaja, FOUR runs wrong line from Abbas, zipping it down towards his pads, and Khawaja gets some willow on a fine glance;
5.4;?;Abbas to Khawaja, no run there's a nice crack off the bat as Khawaja steps into another flowing drive, but this time he finds cover;
5.3;?;Abbas to Khawaja, no run Khawaja whips smartly off his pads, but Imad bends low and stops it cleanly at short fine leg;
5.2;1lb;Abbas to Finch, 1 leg bye Abbas bends his back on this one and finds some seam movement into him off a good length, beating Finch's glance. The ball bounces off the pad and goes to gully, and they find a leg bye;
5.1;1;Abbas to Khawaja, 1 run Khawaja walks down as Abbas loops down a slower one at 113km/h, and he finds just enough space wide of mid on for a quick single;
4.6;1;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, 1 run flicked off the pads for a single;
4.5;4;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, FOUR runs a handsome drive beats cover. It's a shot that wouldn't look out of place in the longer format, Khawaja leaning into a high-elbowed drive;
4.4;4;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, FOUR runs but this one won't be stopped as Imad loses his line towards Khawaja's pads and is deftly glanced away;
4.3;3;Imad Wasim to Finch, 3 runs the first bad ball Imad has bowled, flung down the leg side and Finch just needs to get bat on it. And it's none other than Mohammad Hasnain who runs after it from short fine, hauling the ball in just inside the rope to save a run;
4.2;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run Finch drives towards mid off and wants a run, but it's too tight;
4.1;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run and yet another dot to start, his 13th, as Finch pushes a full one back at the bowler;
3.6;2;Abbas to Khawaja, 2 runs glanced down to fine leg for a brace, and that takes Khawaja to 1,000 runs in ODIs;
3.5;?;Abbas to Khawaja, no run Khawaja skips out, looking to get after Abbas, but punts it straight to mid on. Abbas walks down to have a few words;
3.4;?;Abbas to Khawaja, no run Khawaja drives firmly, but straight to Malik;
3.3;?;Abbas to Khawaja, no run Khawaja hangs his hands out outside off and chops a length ball down close in, and there's no room for a quick single as Rizwan's quickly up;
3.2;?;Abbas to Khawaja, no run Khawaja confidently fetches a full one from outside off, but his shot is stopped at midwicket;
3.1;1;Abbas to Finch, 1 run Finch drives on the up to mid off, and they take the fielder on with a quick single;
2.6;1;Imad Wasim to Finch, 1 run finally a run off him, the ball coming off the inside half of Finch's bat and rolling into space at midwicket;
2.5;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run Imad offers Finch no width whatsoever, firing one in at leg stump;
2.4;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run nicely stopped by Haris Sohail at leg slip, the ball flicking the pad as it was speared down the leg side;
2.3;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run Finch throws his hands into a drive, but the ball drifts in and takes the inside edge, rolling to short fine;
2.2;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run Imad snakes one in from outside off to hurry Finch's jabbing defence with a slider;
2.1;?;Imad Wasim to Finch, no run still no runs off Imad, Finch stepping forward and defending it back to him;
1.6;?;Abbas to Khawaja, no run Abbas straightens his line, aiming for the top of off, and Khawaja defends from the crease;
1.5;4;Abbas to Khawaja, FOUR runs and now through the covers, Khawaja walking into a fluent little drive. The ball pings out of the middle and races through the gap;
1.4;4;Abbas to Khawaja, FOUR runs immediately, a boundary, with some sublime wristwork from Khawaja, who places the ball along the turf and past midwicket;
1.3;1;Abbas to Finch, 1 run and Finch breaks a run of eight dots with a tip-and-run single to mid on, where Malik fields and throws down the stumps with the batsman comfortably home;
1.2;?;Abbas to Finch, no run floated fuller at 125km/h, and a Finch drive is intercepted at cover;
1.1;?;Abbas to Finch, no run he hits a length in the channel and Finch is content defending from the crease;
0.6;?;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, no run full and straight, and he gets bat on this one, pushing it back to the bowler;
0.5;?;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, no run beaten again! Classic Imad, drifting the ball away through the air with precious little flight, and Khawaja pokes inside it;
0.4;?;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, no run punched firmly, but straight at mid off;
0.3;?;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, no run a smashing drive is stopped after a smart dive from Imam in the covers;
0.2;?;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, no run pushed across Khawaja from around the stumps, and this one is left alone;
0.1;?;Imad Wasim to Khawaja, no run past the outside edge! Khawaja leans out at a full one that drifts away from him outside off, beating the bat;

7.09pm Imad Wasim will open the bowling
7.05pm Pakistan walk onto the field and form a huddle ahead of the second dig. If you missed any of the action earlier, it's nicely summed up in Danyal Rasool's match report of a game that so far bears a striking resemblance to that played out between these teams on Friday.
Danish Lalani: "All eyes are on debutant Muhammad Hasnain. Attacking bowling required from Muhammad Abbas and Imad Wasim at beginning followed with Hasnain and Fahim. Yasir needs to gain more confidence today. Malik should mix it with harris sohail unorthodox and his off spinners..." -- As our very own Danyal Rasool put it, Hasnain has already joined the list that is blessed and cursed in equal measure: "The next big thing among Pakistan fast bowlers."
Sanjeet Daryana: "- 18 years of age. - He was awarded player of the match at #PSLFinal last week. - Took three wickets in the final for his team. - Bowled around 151kmph in the tournament once. - Playing his first ODI match against Australia today. - Got the national cap and entry to Pakistan Cricket Team solely because of his impeccable performance in Pakistan Super League. The teenager with that "green dream cap" today. Mohammad Hasnain! Many expectations !"
