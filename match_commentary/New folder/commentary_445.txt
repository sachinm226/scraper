The umpires think the light has gone bad enough to make the Sri Lanka batsmen head off without having to face what could have been a testing over. That will be it from us for today. This is Sidharth Monga signing off on behalf of Cricinfo. Join us tomorrow for the second day's action
Nevertheless a superb innings from Hussey. The Sri Lankans congratulte him as he walks off. Michael Clarke applauds from the balcony. Despite Hussey's superb 95, though, Sri Lanka will be pleased to have restricted Australia to 273 after losing the toss. They will have one over to bat today. Generally, though, they wouldn't want to bat last on this wicket. Which means they will want a huge first-innings lead
Here's James on Beer: "I have long suspected Beer's selection was due to a misunderstanding at a selection meeting attended by Merv Hughes and David Boon. "How about Beer?", asked Andrew Hilditch. Boon and Hughes "Great idea, mate""
86.4;W;Dilshan to Hussey, OUT Given leg-before! Again it's the straighter ball from an offspinner that has done the damage here. This pitched outside off, Hussey defended, playing for the spin, the ball went on with the arm, hit the pad, right in front of off. Kettleborough took his time, then raised the finger. Hussey reviewed it just in case. Replays say there is no just in case here;Michael Hussey lbw b Dilshan 95 (246m 177b 7x4 3x6) SR: 53.67;
86.3;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run long hop, pulled away, turns down the single;
86.2;4;Dilshan to Hussey, FOUR runs and in the meantime, Hussey keeps going on. This is too straight and too full, Hussey sweeps this fine, beats long leg, is now one shot away from a hundred;
86.1;2lb;Dilshan to Hussey, 2 leg byes sharp offbreak, pitches middle and off, beats the sweep, hits the pad, but would never had hit the stumps. Hussey takes two leg-byes;
85.6;?;Randiv to Lyon, no run tossed up outside off, left alone, turns back a long way, but not enough;
85.5;1;Randiv to Hussey, 1 run and Hussey reverse-paddles this to take the single. He is clearly out-thinking Sri Lanka here;
85.4;6;Randiv to Hussey, SIX runs Hussey's gem continues! Hits a six off the fourth ball of this over. Gives him the charge again, makes room, and lofts over long-on. Enters the 90s. Ponting applauds from the balcony;
85.3;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run jumps out of the crease, beaten in the flight, thrusts his pad forward;
85.2;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run cut away again, keeps the strike again;

84.4;1;Lakmal to Hussey, 1 run and Hussey takes the single off the fourth ball again, worked away off the pads;
84.3;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run driven to long-off, and he turns down another single;

83.5;?;Randiv to Lyon, no run flighted outside off, Lyon is well forward to defend;
83.4;1;Randiv to Hussey, 1 run and he takes a single with two balls to go. Drops this into the vastly vacant cover region for one;
83.3;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run another flat delivery, defended again;
83.2;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run flat delivery, Hussey deep in the crease to defend;
83.1;6;Randiv to Hussey, SIX runs Has Welegedara pulled off a special catch? No he hasn't! This is a six! Hussey comes down the ground, chips this inside out towards long-off, Welegedara back-pedals and takes a good catch, only for his heel to step on the skirting. He claims the catch, though, but replays prove him wrong. Peter Siddle kept gesturing, asking them to stay and wait for the replays;
82.6;?;Lakmal to Lyon, no run Lyon is well for ward to push this length ball to point;
82.5;?;Lakmal to Lyon, no run nice yorker first up for the debutant. Swings in late, towards off, Lyon keeps this out;

82.2;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run Hussey charges at him and drives him straight down the ground... into the stumps at the non-striker's end;
82.1;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run low full toss, Hussey flicks this to mid-on;
81.6;W;Randiv to Copeland, OUT Sharp turn, simple bat-pad catch. This is flighted, draws Copeland forward, who looks to play this to leg, is not close to the pitch of the ball, gets an inside edge onto the pad, and an easy catch accrues for short leg;Trent Copeland c Paranavitana b Randiv 12 (21m 16b 3x4 0x6) SR: 75;
81.5;?;Randiv to Copeland, no run overspinner, middle and off, doesn't turn, Copeland defends;
81.4;?;Randiv to Copeland, no run drift, dip, turn, bounce, too good, because this turns back in through the bat-pad gap, misses the edge, and bounces over the stumps;
81.3;1;Randiv to Hussey, 1 run short of a length, gets on his toes, and punches this for a single to sweeper-cover;
81.2;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run flatter, outside off, Hussey defends with an open face;
81.1;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run tossed up outside off, there is turn and bounce, but Hussey doesn't play at it;
80.6;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run floated wide outside off, Copeland doesn't play at it;
80.5;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run full, outside off, driven handsomely, can't beat extra cover;
80.4;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run short outside off, he lets PJ do the collecting;
80.3;4;Lakmal to Copeland, FOUR runs Copeland is hitting boundary after boundary! Short of a length, into the pads, nicely flicked away past square leg. Specialist batsmen would be proud of this;
80.2;1;Lakmal to Hussey, 1 run fuller, but too straight, and he has worked it away into the leg side for one;
80.1;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run Lakmal is short of a length, middle and leg, Hussey is solid as ever;
79.6;?;Randiv to Copeland, no run overpitched around off, defended to cover;
79.5;4;Randiv to Copeland, FOUR runs sweeps and sweeps effectively. Difficult shot for a tall man, but he sees this is close enough to him, and goes for it. Keeps it along the ground;
79.4;?;Randiv to Copeland, no run more turn and bounce, and he lets this one hits his thigh pad;
79.3;?;Randiv to Copeland, no run sharp offbreak, padded away safely, the bounce means he couldn't have been lbw;
79.2;1;Randiv to Hussey, 1 run slightly short, Hussey rocks back and cuts, doesn't farm the strike;
79.1;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run pitched up outside off, left alone to turn away;
78.6;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run another harmless wide delivery, watches it through to PJ;
78.5;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run full and wide, left alone harmlessly;

78.3;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run back of a length, defended to leg;
78.2;4;Lakmal to Copeland, FOUR runs gets a nice juicy full toss on the pads, and he glances it fine for an easy boundary. Sri Lanka is a very welcoming country, Trent;
78.1;W;Lakmal to Harris, OUT Finally they get an lbw out of Kettleborough. This takes a long internal deliberation, though. This is short outside off, Harris doesn't offer a shot, the ball seams back in sharply, and hits him just under the knee roll, just outside off. Because he was not playing a shot, the point of impact was irrelevant. To me, it looked like it would have the the top of off. Kettleborough takes his time before sending Harris on his way. Harris mulls a review, but doesn't ask for it. I tell you what, the ball projection shows this didn't come back in to hit the stumps! Even if Harris thought he was out, he should have gone for that strategic review;Ryan Harris lbw b Lakmal 1 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
77.6;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run slower offbreak, short to, Hussey covers the stumps, and shoulders arms;
77.5;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run presses right forward to defend this to cover;
77.4;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run sharp turn and bounce, but this is pitched outside off, and he doesn't play at it;
77.3;1;Randiv to Harris, 1 run uppishly played, but between forward short leg and short midwicket;
77.2;?;Randiv to Harris, no run this one turns in sharply, Harris plays towards the short legs, but bisects them;
77.1;1;Randiv to Hussey, 1 run Hussey keeps nudging and deflecting. this time he stretches forward and drops this towards point for a single;
76.6;?;Lakmal to Harris, no run good thinking, tries to slip in the yorker, off-stump line, Harris keeps it out, though;
76.5;?;Lakmal to Harris, no run shortish, widish, Harris leaves it be;
76.4;W;Lakmal to Johnson, OUT soft soft dismissal after many much more menacing deliveries! This is short and wide, going wider, but Johnson goes for the pull as opposed to the cut, and gets a faint bottom edge through to PJ. It was so innocuous the slips didn't even realise he had edged it!;Mitchell Johnson c ?Jayawardene b Lakmal 14 (36m 33b 1x4 0x6) SR: 42.42;
76.3;?;Lakmal to Johnson, no run short of a length, pitched outside leg, hits Johnson's pads in front of middle. Rightly given not out;

76.1;1;Lakmal to Hussey, 1 run starts with a full ball on the pads, and is picked away for a single;
75.6;4;Randiv to Johnson, FOUR runs poor delivery to end the over, and Johnson is alert enough to crash this short delivery through the covers for four;
75.5;?;Randiv to Johnson, no run and he misses the edge again! This is flighted again, pitches on a length, in front of off, and with a puff of dust, kicks off. PJ does well this time to collect it;
75.4;2b;Randiv to Johnson, 2 byes Where did this come from? Pitched on a length, just outside off, and explodes, chest high, and even PJ can't collect this;
75.3;2;Randiv to Johnson, 2 runs too straight, worked into the leg side for two;
75.2;?;Randiv to Johnson, no run big appeal for a catch at the wicket. There is sharp turn and bounce, but there is also daylight between bat and pad. The shout more in hope than conviction. Can't fool Mr Dar;
75.1;?;Randiv to Johnson, no run turn and bounce again, beats the outside edge as Johnson looks to defend;
74.6;?;Herath to Hussey, no run floated across him, defended off the back foot;
74.5;1;Herath to Johnson, 1 run drifting into the pads, helped away into the leg side;
74.4;2;Herath to Johnson, 2 runs flighted outside off, driven against the turn, middle of the bat, along the ground, gets a couple;

74.2;2;Herath to Hussey, 2 runs helped towards fine leg for a couple;
74.1;?;Herath to Hussey, no run quick, full, 93ks Hussey adjusts well, bringing the bat down in time;
73.6;2;Randiv to Johnson, 2 runs Johnson's patience ends. He goes for the slog-sweep, gets a thick top edge over the slips;
73.5;?;Randiv to Johnson, no run slightly short of a length, defended with an open face;
73.4;1;Randiv to Hussey, 1 run lovely running, just tips and runs to cover, and of all the places Sri Lanka is the toughest place to keep taking sharp singles all day long;

72.2;2;Herath to Johnson, 2 runs driven uppishly, not in control, but finds the gap in the covers;
72.1;?;Herath to Johnson, no run this is the carrom ball, pitches middle and leg, holds its line, hits Johnson in front of middle and leg. Kettleborough says no, and replays show a faint edge on the way;
71.6;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run quicker, defended towards cover;
71.5;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run Edged and well short. Lovely bowling, pitches middle and off, turns away, Hussey's hands are soft, the edge is soft, and Mahela takes it on a half-volley at first slip;

67.3;W;Randiv to Haddin, OUT Sharp offbreak, sharp catch! This is quick, turning in sharply, Haddin turns it around the corner... around the corner is Mathews at backward short leg who takes a smart low catch in front of him;Brad Haddin c Mathews b Randiv 24 (44m 46b 3x4 1x6) SR: 52.17;
67.2;1;Randiv to Hussey, 1 run placed wide of mid-on for one;
67.1;6;Randiv to Hussey, SIX runs another top shot from Hussey. Charges at Randiv, goes inside out over mid-off for the second six of the series. He was so close to the pitch of the ball the turn couldn't have bothered him;

65.2;?;Randiv to Haddin, no run flighted outside off, this time Haddin defends;
65.1;6;Randiv to Haddin, SIX runs lovely straight drive. Beautiful swing of the arms after taking half a step down the track. Right over the bowler's head;
64.6;?;Herath to Hussey, no run lovely bowling, pushed through, 94ks, Hussey is taken by surprise, is late into it, is beaten, and is hit on the knee roll when deep in the crease. Huge shout obviously, but they are not getting any lbws from Kettleborough;

54.6;?;Dilshan to Haddin, no run turning into the pads, defended to leg;

52.3;1;Dilshan to Khawaja, 1 run quick flat offbreak, gets an edge, which dies right away, and goes past slip for one;
52.2;?;Dilshan to Khawaja, no run right forward to push this to cover;
52.1;?;Dilshan to Khawaja, no run sharp offbreak, pitches just outside off, beats the tentative Khawaja;
51.6;?;Welegedara to Hussey, no run yorker, this is surely reversing here. Big shout for lbw. Umpire Dar says not out. Dilshan challenges the call. Me, I would rarely question Dar. This is full, swinging in late, pitches in front of middle, hits him in front of leg, and would have missed the leg stump, so the original decision stays. Umpire Taufel, who is doing commentary right now, immediately made out from Dar's mannerisms that he had suggested right away to the third umpire that it was headed down. And so it turned out. I don't remember a bad spell for Dar! Meanwhile no reviews left for Sri Lanka;
51.5;1;Welegedara to Khawaja, 1 run more late swing, Khawaja is a bit more loose than Hussey, gets an inside edge onto the the pad. Sneaks in the single;

51.2;?;Welegedara to Hussey, no run fuller, wide of off, left alone;
51.1;4;Welegedara to Hussey, FOUR runs short and wide, and Hussey welcomes this with a steer through the vacant third man region;

50.5;?;Lakmal to Khawaja, no run short of a length, around off, pushed to mid-off;
50.4;2;Lakmal to Khawaja, 2 runs pulled away again, from chest-high, and keeps it down too, gets a couple;
50.3;?;Lakmal to Khawaja, no run full, some late swing away from him, gets an edge into the ground, and then through towards slips. Falls well short of them too;

48.3;1;Lakmal to Hussey, 1 run length ball, on the pads, worked around the corner for one;
48.2;4;Lakmal to Hussey, FOUR runs slower offcutter, nicely played with an open face, steered away really, between slips and gully, for the first boundary in 83 balls;

47.6;?;Randiv to Khawaja, no run flighted around middle and off, defended off the front foot;

46.1;1;Lakmal to Khawaja, 1 run Khawaja presses forward, pushes this to mid-off, runs through for one, Dilshan swoops on this, tries an underarm flick, his momentum carries him into a collision with Khawaja, who is now down on the ground;
45.6;1;Randiv to Khawaja, 1 run pushed with an open face, gets a single wide of point;
45.5;?;Randiv to Khawaja, no run more turn, but Khawaja doesn't play at this one, sees it safely through to PJ;

44.3;?;Lakmal to Khawaja, no run length ball, angling across, pushed to cover;
44.2;?;Lakmal to Khawaja, no run full outside off, defended to cover;
44.1;?;Lakmal to Khawaja, no run Big shout first up. They are going for the review for the inside edge. This is short of a length, looks like it will angle across, but holds its line slightly, and Khawaja punches away from the body. There is a sound as it passes the bat, although the replays don't conclusively prove there is an inside edge onto the pad and then through to P Jayawardene. More drama. This is a bit of a farce really. Umpire Kettleborough rules this not-out. And I am lip-reading here, Dilshan seems to ask the umpire if there was bat on the way. It seems the umpire has said yes, and Dilshan is excited again, because then this is clearly caught bat-pad. Kettleborough has another conversation upstairs, and rules not-out again. I assume that is because the technology doesn't conclusively prove an edge. We have neither Hot Spot nor Snicko here. It couldn't have been lbw anyway, because it was angling away, and wasn't going to hit the stumps, even if Hurricane Irene pushed it back in;
43.6;1;Randiv to Khawaja, 1 run slower through the air, shorter too, pushed wide of point for one;
43.5;?;Randiv to Khawaja, no run too full, easy for Khawaja to smother the turn;
43.4;?;Randiv to Khawaja, no run sharp offbreak, pitches middle and off, and breaks away. Defended with soft hands;

40.6;?;Herath to Hussey, no run forward in solid defence, is Hussey;
40.5;1;Herath to Khawaja, 1 run leading edge, dies right into the ground. Closes the face to this outside off. Looking very uncertain;
40.4;?;Herath to Khawaja, no run closer to off now, plays this one more comfortably;
40.3;?;Herath to Khawaja, no run again gets to see a big gap between Khawaja's bat and pad, hits the inside half of the bat;
40.2;1;Herath to Hussey, 1 run comes down the track to take this on the full, gets a single wide of mid-on;
40.1;?;Herath to Hussey, no run doesn't turn in as much as expected, gets a soft outside edge. No slip in place;

"@James - Although I agree that we don't have quite the same crop of bowlers at the moment, the pitches also play a massive part - several boards are only interested in matches hitting 5 days and so force bowlers to bowl on roads, allowing batsmen to do what they will." That is a strong point, Hugh
Finally Randiv is back on
 Innings Start
On Test debut, a proud Nathan Lyon leads Australia off the field with the ball in his hands. No fight at all from Sri Lanka, they were always under pressure after Dilshan's needless bravado early on. Australia doing everything right, seamers not giving anything away in terms of width or driving length, spinner coming in superbly on a helpful pitch, and allrounder proving his value with deadly reverse swing. Fielding backing up the bowling with total commitment in the sapping heat. 168 is a huge lead to concede on a breaking surface. Can Sri Lanka come back? Only if Australia's collapse is worse than theirs
Dave: "Lyon takes his first first class 5 for.... All of a sudden Lyon's first-class average looks respectable. Can't say that about many Aussie spinners."
briscricfan: "How often do you see the debutant take a wicket with both his first and last ball in his debut innings?"
Gareth: "Beer on ice as Lyon Roars."

56.4;4;Randiv to Copeland, FOUR runs more fun for Copeland... this is pitched middle and leg, he clears the front leg and sweeps again. Powerfully so. Wide of deep square leg;
56.3;?;Randiv to Copeland, no run gets this to turn from middle and leg, beats him, but the lbw appeal is rightly stifled;
56.2;4;Randiv to Copeland, FOUR runs more sweeping, more boundaries for Copleland... overpitched delivery, Copeland frees his arm with the sweep, bisects the two deep fielders on the on side - 18 off 18 now;

55.3;4;Herath to Lyon, FOUR runs time for Lyon to hit a four now... too full, outside leg, swept fine, and the fine leg is too square. Captains usually go finer with the fielders behind square when the tail is in. Dilshan a bit slow here?;
55.2;?;Herath to Lyon, no run turns and takes the edge, but it falls short of the slips;

53.3;W;Herath to Harris, OUT and immediately he gets the wicket! Flighted on middle and leg, Harris plays a scorching straight drive, but in the air, and straight into Herath's lap. That's a five-for for Herath. And a valuable hand from Harris;Ryan Harris c & b Herath 23 (63m 45b 3x4 0x6) SR: 51.11;

51.4;2;Herath to Harris, 2 runs sharp turn across him, takes the edge, which lobs over the slips;
51.3;?;Herath to Harris, no run dropped. A really tough chance. Harris drives this back, Herath dives across the breadth of the pitch, but gets too far I think. The ball hits his wrist!;
51.2;?;Herath to Harris, no run turns sharply across, left alone;
51.1;?;Herath to Harris, no run pitched outside leg, thrust your pad forward, easy. No short leg either;
50.6;4;Welegedara to Copeland, FOUR runs pitched up further, slightly wide of off, Copleland drives at it, the ball grips the surface, goes uppishly, between mid-ff and extra cover. First runs off the opening bowler with the score already 174;

50.1;W;Welegedara to Khawaja, OUT and he has struck first ball! Full ball, swinging in late, beats his flick, pitched off, hits him in front of middle and leg. Aleem Dar has no doubt about this. Khawaja reviews the decision just in case, and he nearly gets it his way as this is a tight call on the no-ball. Just about makes it as a legal delivery. The rest is fine, though. No inside edge, hit him inside the line, would have gone on to peg the leg stump. Got to go, Usman, but an important innings, one that might just have put it beyond SL's reach;Usman Khawaja lbw b Welegedara 26 (83m 68b 2x4 1x6) SR: 38.23;
49.6;?;Dilshan to Harris, no run another big appeal for lbw, this is a length ball, turning in from outside off, but it seems Harris has got the pad outside the line of off. Anyway, Sri Lanka have no reviews left;

49.4;?;Dilshan to Harris, no run flat again, defended off the back foot this time;

46.4;?;Lakmal to Harris, no run short of a length again, nips back in, defended back to the bowler;
46.3;?;Lakmal to Harris, no run short of a length outside off, punched solidly to cover;
46.2;?;Lakmal to Harris, no run fuller, swinging in, defended off the front foot. The Jayawardenes apeeal for an lbw. They are going for the pad-first dismissal. And they will use the DRS. I tell you what, the bat and pad are very close together, and this is a good review. However, we don't have enough technology available here to call it for sure. At any rate, the ball hit the pad only half in line with off, so the umpire's original decision would have stood anyway. Aleem Dar seen gesturing to the Sri Lankan fielders that the point of impact was a point of contention;
46.1;?;Lakmal to Harris, no run nipping into the pads, beats the bat, but it is headed down the leg side;

42.3;6;Randiv to Khawaja, SIX runs This target might now be getting into the impossible zone. Lovely shot from Khawaja, charges down the track again, gets to the pitch of this one, and lofts it over mid-on. Clean connection;
42.2;1;Randiv to Harris, 1 run turning into the pads, placed between the two short legs for a single;
42.1;4;Randiv to Harris, FOUR runs that's a biff, and Australia are taking this beyond Sri Lanka's reach slowly... slightly short of a length, and he opens up his stance by taking the front leg out of the way, and slogs it for four between deep square leg and deep midwicket;
41.6;?;Herath to Khawaja, no run tries the reverse paddle now, the ball turns and bounces, hits the back of the bat, lobs just short of short fine leg;
41.5;?;Herath to Khawaja, no run flicked away, in the air, wide of short leg;

40.6;?;Randiv to Khawaja, no run defended to off, doesn't mind giving Harris the strike;

40.3;?;Randiv to Khawaja, no run tossed up outside off, Khawaja shapes up to cut, but eventually leaves it alone;

40.1;?;Randiv to Khawaja, no run tossed up outside off, defended;
39.6;4;Herath to Harris, FOUR runs another poor delivery, a long hop really, and full marks to Harris for being alert to the scoring opportunity. Goes back and pulls this over midwicket;
39.5;?;Herath to Harris, no run flighted on middle and leg, smothers the turn off the front foot;
39.4;?;Herath to Harris, no run pitches off, turns away, left alone... over the wicket to the right-hander makes no sense to me;

38.3;1;Randiv to Khawaja, 1 run nicely pushed past cover to get a single that takes the lead to 300;
38.2;?;Randiv to Khawaja, no run length ball, just outside off, dead-batted by Khawaja;
38.1;1lb;Randiv to Harris, 1 leg bye leaves his crease, seemed to me he kicked this away with the bat hidden, but they get the leg-bye. Replays, however, suggest bat and pad were close together, so he did offer a shot;
37.6;?;Herath to Khawaja, no run this one pitches outside off, turns, beats the batsman, ends up down the leg side;
37.5;?;Herath to Khawaja, no run comes down the track, is beaten in the turn, but kicks this away;
37.4;?;Herath to Khawaja, no run on the front foot to defend this;
37.3;W;Herath to Johnson, OUT Johnson is gone. This one bounces a touch more than expected. Johnson went for the slog sweep, this pitched on a length, took a piece of the pitch with it as it bounced, and took the top edge for a simple catch for PJ;Mitchell Johnson c ?Jayawardene b Herath 8 (20m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 42.1;

36.2;?;Randiv to Khawaja, no run Khawaja pushes away from the body, turns across his bat;
36.1;1;Randiv to Johnson, 1 run tossed on the pads, and he has driven it down to long-on for one. Dilshan very conservative about conceding runs;
35.6;?;Herath to Khawaja, no run more quick turn, and again it is turning down leg. Hits the pad and lobs to short leg;
35.5;?;Herath to Khawaja, no run this is straighter, and because it is going to turn down leg, he kicks it away;

34.5;?;Randiv to Johnson, no run tossed up wide outside off, doesn't need to play at that;

34.2;?;Randiv to Johnson, no run goes for the push now, finds the middle of the bat, but can't beat cover;

33.5;?;Herath to Khawaja, no run presses forward again and keeps out another fullish one on the off side;

29.3;W;Herath to Hussey, OUT appeal for a catch at forward short leg, Hussey pushes forward, and it turns to loop off the pad in front of short leg who dives forward to snap it up low, Sri Lanka go for the review, replays show that the ball seemed to have brushed the glove on its way up after hitting the flap of the pad, Hussey walks off disappointed;Michael Hussey c Paranavitana b Herath 15 (61m 37b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40.54;

21.5;1;Dilshan to Clarke, 1 run pushes a full delivery on the off side for a single;
21.4;?;Dilshan to Clarke, no run sees him advancing and bowls it flat, Clarke stops and works him towards midwicket, then retreats;
21.3;?;Dilshan to Clarke, no run Clarke caught on the crease again, this time the umpire agrees with Sri Lanka, but it is Clarke's turn to review, and would you believe it, the turn on that one would have taken it well down leg, he was struck in front of leg stump and the ball was turning in from outside off stump;
21.2;?;Dilshan to Clarke, no run makes room outside leg as this one turns in a long way from outside off, he cuts it from middle stump towards extra cover;
21.1;?;Dilshan to Clarke, no run bounces a shade from outside off, hits Clarke high on the bat as he presses forward;

20.5;?;Randiv to Hussey, no run turns away from Hussey from round the stumps, he gets forward and pushes with an open face towards point;
20.4;1lb;Randiv to Clarke, 1 leg bye loud appeal for lbw, Clarke caught on the crease as this one turns in sharply, catching him on the pads, was that hit outside the line of off, or was height an issue, Sri Lanka go for the review, replays show it struck him just in line and would have just clipped the bails, umpire's decision stands, and Clarke lives on;

17.1;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run pushes a flighted ball towards extra cover;
16.6;2;Herath to Clarke, 2 runs this one is not as short, and not much width as well, but Clarke backs away, makes room and cuts behind point again;
16.5;4;Herath to Clarke, FOUR runs presses forward, sees it flat and short, and goes back immediately to cut in flash backward of point;

15.3;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run pushed off the front foot down the track;
15.2;W;Dilshan to Hughes, OUT Dilshan gets Hughes, who falls leg before on the sweep, Australia go for the review, it was flighted full around off stump, Hughes went down for the swing but missed, the ball seemed to straighten sharply on the replay, would that have missed off, but the ball tracker shows it going straight on with the angle and hitting leg stump, hmm, Hughes is gone anyways;Phillip Hughes lbw b Dilshan 28 (63m 51b 3x4 1x6) SR: 54.9;
15.1;?;Dilshan to Hughes, no run Dilshan tossed it from round the stumps, Hughes keeps it out with a shuffle and a block;

14.4;?;Herath to Hughes, no run;
14.3;?;Herath to Hughes, no run this one has turned in a lot, but Hughes was sure it was going to miss off stump, and left it alone;

14.1;1;Herath to Hughes, 1 run opens the face as he stretches forward to run a tossed up ball past slip;
13.6;?;Dilshan to Clarke, no run down the track now, but still away from the pitch of the ball, hits it back to the bowler;
13.5;4;Dilshan to Clarke, FOUR runs brings up the 50 of the stand with a ferocious pull in front of square leg as Dilshan drops it too short;
13.4;4;Dilshan to Clarke, FOUR runs gets a nudge on this one turning down leg, and to the right of a helpless Mahela at backward short leg;

13.1;?;Dilshan to Clarke, no run turning in from outside off but down the leg side;
12.6;?;Herath to Hughes, no run pads up to one turning in from over the stumps, too far outside off for the umpire to be impressed with the loud appeal;

12.4;1;Herath to Clarke, 1 run Clarke skips out again, and eases a flighted ball to mid on for a single;

stuart: "I know one of them will get out fast (probably before this is posted in any case) but I love seeing Pup Clarke and Hughes batting like this! Using their feet and really challenging the spinners on a pitch that seems like it'll get them out at some stage anyway."
 Innings Start
That's all from Galle, but there is more cricket happening in Bulawayo and Chester-le-Street. You can read the Galle report here. Cheers from me, Sidharth Monga
Tony Greig hosts the presentation ceremony. Tillakaratne Dilshan is the first one to come up. He says, "They played well. Especially in the first innings they batted really well. I feel if we had got to even 200-225 in the first innings, we would have had a good tight match. Mahela and Mathews batted really well, good fightback, unfortunately Mahela got out to the new ball. Expected the pitch to turn, but not so much from the first day. But Test cricket is not easy, just one of the challenges of Test cricket."
The Man-of-the-Match couldn't have been easy, but for his innings on the first day, it is Michael Hussey. "It is a pretty pleasing test match, considering the conditions. We adapted pretty well. Probably the driest wicket I have played on to start with, but that is the good thing about international. You just adapt to different conditions. A very satisfactory Test win for us."
Michael Clarke walks up now. He says, "My first as captain, so very excited. The way we played throughout was spot on. As the days went on, the wicket died a bit, and the pace came off. So the most important part was the new ball, and our bowlers executed the plans with both new balls. The debutants did a fantastic job. Very special."
"Can't happen often that the bowler with the second most wickets in an attack is an opening batsman. Wasn't Wilfred Rhodes an opener too? But he wasn't a fast bowler." Travis, Manoj Prabhakar might have done that. Watto himself might have done that before. Mohammad Hafeez opened the bowling and batting recently on a turner in the West Indies
Lovely scenes of celebration. There's something on the faces after you win an away Test that no other look can match, not even a World Cup win. It is some special kind of satisfaction
A hundredth Test win for Ricky Ponting, easily a record, and a staggering one at that (for a perspective on that number, India reached 100 Test wins in 2009, and surely there are a few other teams who are yet to win even that many). First Test win for Clarke as captain. And Australia have now beaten Sri Lanka six times in Sri Lanka, joint-best along with Pakistan. Ryan Harris has taken out two stumps to keep with him. He bowled superbly. Mahela and Mathews fought and fought, but this was always going to be a mountain too high. Sri Lanka will look back at the number of loose balls their spinners bowled to the Aussie tail, who applied themselves and cashed in on the loose ones
95.5;W;Lyon to Lakmal, OUT There it is. A big win for Australia. Lakmal gives him the charge, never gets to the pitch of it, and heaves, seemingly over mid-on. Johnson, though, runs back, and takes it almost over his shoulder;Suranga Lakmal c Johnson b Lyon 5 (15m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
95.4;1;Lyon to Welegedara, 1 run shorter, turning in, drives loosely at it, gets an inside edge;

95.1;?;Lyon to Welegedara, no run tossed up outside off, defended to cover;
94.6;?;Watson to Lakmal, no run nips back in, through the gap as he doesn't even try to get in line, but it misses the off stump by inches;
94.5;1;Watson to Welegedara, 1 run guided with the angle, gets a single to long leg;
94.4;?;Watson to Welegedara, no run right behind this outside off to drive it to mid-off;
94.3;2;Watson to Welegedara, 2 runs more swing for Watson, Chanaka drives, gets a thick inside edge for two;
94.2;?;Watson to Welegedara, no run swinging in, defended back to him;
94.1;W;Watson to Angelo Mathews, OUT And Watto does it again! This is smart bowling. Not sure if this was intended to be a slower ball, but it comes at 124ks, Mathews sees a length ball, and thinks this is the ball to get to his hundred. He is well early into the shot, and the off stump is pegged back. Once again, he is dismissed in the 90s. The team-mates stand up and applaud him, but so gutted is he he doesn't even raise his bat on the way back. Even that last 90 came in a losing cause, perhaps he is saving the hundred for a win;Angelo Mathews b Watson 95 (238m 191b 13x4 0x6) SR: 49.73;
93.6;?;Lyon to Lakmal, no run ads this away, turning down the leg side. Mathews now has a full over to get closer to the century;
93.5;1;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, 1 run worked with the turn, gets a single off the fifth ball of the over;
93.4;1;Lyon to Lakmal, 1 run plays the instinctive shot to this one turning into the pads, the balls takes the glove and eludes leg gully. Only just;
93.3;?;Lyon to Lakmal, no run full, turning in, defended back to the bowler;
93.2;?;Lyon to Lakmal, no run turns in sharply from outside off, hits the pad outside the line of off;
93.1;1;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, 1 run low full toss from round the stumps, smote to long-on for on;
92.6;?;Harris to Lakmal, no run pushes away from the body, it goes uppishly, but bounces short of gully;
92.5;?;Harris to Lakmal, no run short of a length again, this one is waist-high, and he is right behind it;
92.4;4;Harris to Lakmal, FOUR runs short, rib/chest-high, Lakmal fends this off, and the edge bisects the slips and gully;
92.3;W;Harris to Herath, OUT Rangana has pulled this straight to short midwicket. Mathews on 93 stands alone at non-striker's and looks down at the ground. Harris gets a deserved Michelle. This is short, angling in, and the limp pull shot goes straight down Copeland's throat;Rangana Herath c Copeland b Harris 12 (15m 14b 2x4 0x6) SR: 85.71;
92.2;?;Harris to Herath, no run stays low, holds its line, beats the bat, bounces well short of Haddin;
92.1;4;Harris to Herath, FOUR runs There goes Rangana. Length ball outside off, stops at him, but he goes through the line, and over mid-off. Dilshan can't sit and watch, he has gone to hide behind a couch;
91.6;1;Johnson to Herath, 1 run hits the inside half of the bat and they take a single to wide of mid-on;
91.5;?;Johnson to Herath, no run driven straight back to Johnson;
91.4;2;Johnson to Herath, 2 runs Herath may as well be in a dodgy night club. He is swinging injudiciously, and top-edges this short ball, which stays up for an eternity but clears mid-on. Not sure Mathews will like it;
91.3;?;Johnson to Herath, no run angles too far down the leg side. No connection;
91.2;1;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, 1 run length ball outside off, pushed away off the middle of the bat to sweeper-cover for one;
91.1;?;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, no run full outside off, Mathews drives, gets the inside half of the bat, towards mid-on;
90.6;?;Harris to Herath, no run another huge swing at a length ball outside off, with his partner in the 90s... Misses it altogether. Dilshan in the balcony doesn't look too impressed;
90.5;?;Harris to Herath, no run full and wide off, Herath swings at it again, makes no connection;
90.4;4;Harris to Herath, FOUR runs Herath throws his bat at this full delivery, gets a thick edge between second slip and gully;
90.3;?;Harris to Herath, no run length ball, angling across, pushed with soft hands;
90.2;?;Harris to Herath, no run short, quick, gets a bottom edge into his body;
90.1;?;Harris to Herath, no run yorker, around off, digs it out;
89.6;?;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, no run full outside off, driven crisply to mid-off. Won't get a single;
89.5;4;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, FOUR runs short, into the ribs, emphatically pulled away, wide of long leg, enters the 90s;
89.4;?;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, no run late-cuts this, finds gully on the bounce;
89.3;4;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, FOUR runs Mathews is going to attack now, and this is a lovely drive to a length ball outside off, through the gap between mid-off and extra cover;
89.2;1;Johnson to Herath, 1 run it's the full one, and a relieved Herath throws his arms at it, clears point, and breaks the pair;
89.1;W;Johnson to Randiv, OUT Johnson finally bowls his perfect line and length, especially for a tailender. Short, into the ribs/chest area, around off, rising all the time, and Randiv fends it to second slip;Suraj Randiv c Clarke b Johnson 0 (14m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
88.6;4;Harris to Angelo Mathews, FOUR runs no mid-on, and he has push-driven an overpitched delivery through there. He was run out on 99 when taking the second in Mumbai, which is his top score. Can he beat that today?;
88.5;2;Harris to Angelo Mathews, 2 runs good running, hits this wide of cover, it has hardly crossed what would have been a 30-yard circle in ODIs, and comes back for a comfortable second;
88.4;?;Harris to Angelo Mathews, no run digs this one in short, Mathews is looking to duck, but the ball doesn't come up. He has to awkwardly keep out this waist-high delivery;
88.3;?;Harris to Angelo Mathews, no run pitched up, middle and off, pushed back;
88.2;?;Harris to Angelo Mathews, no run defended off the front foot, towards cover;
88.1;?;Harris to Angelo Mathews, no run some late swing into the pads, beats the bat, but it is headed down the leg side;

87.1;?;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, no run angled in, stops a touch after itching on a length, Mathews keeps it down;
86.6;?;Harris to Randiv, no run bouncer, but it hardly bounces high, and Randiv has to put in an extra effort to get under this one;
86.5;?;Harris to Randiv, no run fuller, shaping in, pushed back off the front foot;
86.4;?;Harris to Randiv, no run extra bounce outside off, Randiv doesn't play at it;
86.3;?;Harris to Randiv, no run short of a length, moving in, defended off the front foot;
86.2;?;Harris to Randiv, no run full, shaping in, defended from the crease;
86.1;W;Harris to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT Harris has found that wicket. He is thrilled. This is the wicket. Mahela is gone after an outstanding century. Harris has persisted - with old ball or new - at that fifth or sixth stumps line, getting the ball to either nip back in or hold its line. Mahela has been defending them solidly. This being the new ball, it nips back a touch more than he expects, and it takes the inside edge onto the leg stump;Mahela Jayawardene b Harris 105 (311m 231b 15x4 1x6) SR: 45.45;
86.1;1w;Harris to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 wide bouncer, and it takes off the surface, and bounces too high;

84.6;4;Harris to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs full on the pads, and superbly flicked away by Mahela, between midwicket and square leg, all along the ground;
84.5;1;Harris to Angelo Mathews, 1 run nearly the breakthrough! This one stops on Mathews, who is playing well in front of his body, the bat face turns, the ball flies past the diving Ponting at short midwicket;
84.4;?;Harris to Angelo Mathews, no run thick edge from Mathews as this holds its line outside off, but it bounces well short of gully;
84.3;?;Harris to Angelo Mathews, no run defended with an open face, towards point;
84.2;?;Harris to Angelo Mathews, no run holds its line outside off, defended solidly with an open face;
84.1;?;Harris to Angelo Mathews, no run pushed to mid-off, wants a single that could have been suicidal. Mahela sends him back;
83.6;1;Copeland to Angelo Mathews, 1 run punched off the back foot, gets a single in the covers;
83.5;?;Copeland to Angelo Mathews, no run stays back and is squared up in defence again. Surely that must be how he plays, because for all the squaring-up he hasn't edged many;
83.4;?;Copeland to Angelo Mathews, no run wide outside off, left alone;
83.3;?;Copeland to Angelo Mathews, no run Mathews is squared up again as he defends this off the back foot;
83.2;?;Copeland to Angelo Mathews, no run a touch wide outside off, left alone;
83.1;?;Copeland to Angelo Mathews, no run pitched on a length, outside off, pushed to cover;
82.6;4;Harris to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs Century No. 29, and boy is he pumped? Superb innings in the conditions, and after that top-order collapse. Late-cuts this, punches the air as soon as it passes gully. His wife, his mates in the balcony, the crowd all stand for him. Mahela removes the helmet, and looks really pleased with his effort;
82.5;?;Harris to Mahela Jayawardene, no run another length ball outside off, Mahela is on the front foot to meet it;
82.4;?;Harris to Mahela Jayawardene, no run length ball outside off, defended back to the bowler;

82.2;?;Harris to Mahela Jayawardene, no run fuller and closer to off, defended solidly off the front foot;
82.1;4;Harris to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs good bowling, but well negotiated. This is short of a length, outside off, Mahela plays for the angle, this one holds its line, bounces too, with his soft hands, Mahela keeps it down and gets four through third man;
81.6;?;Copeland to Angelo Mathews, no run stays back to defend another ball seaming away a touch. Squared up again;
81.5;?;Copeland to Angelo Mathews, no run seam movement away from the batsman. I know Mathews exaggerates this acting of getting squared up, but this one moved appreciably away;

81.3;?;Copeland to Mahela Jayawardene, no run driven on the up, Hughes dives to his right at cover, Mahela wants one, Mathews doesn't. He has to rush back in;

80.3;?;Harris to Angelo Mathews, no run some more extra bounce, but well outside off, left alone;

79.6;1;Clarke to Angelo Mathews, 1 run a touch too short, and cut away for a single;
79.5;?;Clarke to Angelo Mathews, no run flat, but this one turns and bounces, beats Mathews's bat, hits the glove, but doesn't lob up in the air;

78.5;?;Watson to Angelo Mathews, no run Watson puts some action on this, runs his fingers across it, and it nips back in after gripping the surface. Misses both the inside edge and the stumps;

76.1;?;Watson to Angelo Mathews, no run defended back to Watson, and this one takes a bit off the pitch on its way back!;
75.6;?;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, no run defended off the back foot;
75.5;?;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, no run big, big,prolonged shout for lbw. Looked a good appeal to me. Angled across from round the stumps, pitched around off, maybe outside, then turned back in, beating the bat. Hit him deep in the crease, in front of stumps. Perhaps the height saved him. Clarke doesn't at all look interested in the review. The Hawk-Eye replay says it would have clipped the top of middle and leg. So the on-field decision would have stayed;
75.4;?;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, no run a puff of dust there, Mahela rides the bounce from deep in the crease;
75.3;1;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, 1 run worked around the corner for a single;

73.5;?;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, no run back to playing the forward-defensive now;
73.4;4;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, FOUR runs every now and then Mathews loses patience. Again he jumps out of the crease, tries to biff over long-on, gets a leading edge that goes over covers for four;

73.2;?;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, no run turning in sharply, defended with soft hands;
73.1;?;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, no run tossed up outside off, Mathews is right forward to defend;

71.5;1;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run deep into the crease, works this around the corner for a single;
71.4;4;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs Jayawardene improvising well... sees this is short, goes down on a knee, and plays a sort of paddle-pull, to the left of the keeper. Four more;
71.3;?;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, no run more extra bounce as Mahela goes back, but he keeps his bat and gloves out of the way;
71.2;?;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, no run flat, on the pads, defended to forward short leg;
71.1;4;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs more misbehaviour... Maehla looks to play the late cut, the ball explodes off a length, takes the back of the bat, over the slips;

69.6;1;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run the back-cut now, gets a single;
69.5;6;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, SIX runs Jayawardene comes down the track, and does it in some style. This is slightly flat, Mahela is not right to the pitch of it, but knows it is in his swinging arc. And he swings cleanly and sweetly over long-on;
69.4;1;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, 1 run worked around the corner now, another single;
69.3;?;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, no run gets the bottom hand off as he defends this length ball;

67.6;?;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, no run another lbw shout, this time it seems Jayawardene might have padded up. Ump Kettleborough says not out. Mahela was surely outside the line. It might have turned too far too. So they don't review;
67.5;?;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, no run sharp turn, beats the bat, hits the pad, there is an lbw shout, but the bounce was taking it over;

65.3;1;Lyon to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run swept away along the ground, gets a single to long leg;
65.2;1;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, 1 run Mathews nearly loses the fight of patience. Gives Lyon the charge, the ball grips along with a puff of dust, he can only end up mis-hitting towards deep midwicket. Doesn't carry, though;

63.5;?;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, no run full outside off, driven powerfully, but can't beat the two short extra covers;
63.4;4;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, FOUR runs short, not a bouncer, just a long hop, and Mathews plays the short-arm pull through midwicket. Very well timed. Mathews reaches fifty, punches the air, gets a pat on the helmet from Mahela;
63.3;4;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, FOUR runs another outside edge found. This is the slower offcutter, only slightly slower, pitches on a length, in front of leg, squares Mathews up by moving away, but the thick edge dies and goes wide of gully;

61.1;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run good bouncer, from wide of the crease, headed towards the head, Mahela has to fend, keeps it down. Wonder why they don't have a short leg if he is going to bowl short;
