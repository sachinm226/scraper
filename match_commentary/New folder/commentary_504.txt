Very good finish there for Australia, but overall they'd be a touch disappointed they couldn't push up to 300 after the platform laid by Ricky Ponting. Michael Clarke played superbly and deserved a century, but in a way was a victim of his inability to clear the ropes and ended unbeaten on 99. The pitch is true, the outfield fast, but chasing down a score as big as 290 won't be easy at all. Should be an intriguing chase.
Brydon Coverdale has plenty more in his bulletin and, since we have a moment, I should point any Google Chrome users to our fancy Toolbar, so do enjoy that.
49.6;1b;Bresnan to Smith, 1 bye good ball from Bresnan to finish, yorker, Smith aims big and misses, Kieswetter collects and they run a bye to reach 290;
49.5;4;Bresnan to Smith, FOUR runs brilliant stuff this from Smith, conventional shot, just chipping a drive over cover and timing it perfectly to collect all four. Poor old Clarke will be stuck on 99;
49.4;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run ha! well, he almost found the new gap, aiming a kind of switch-hit, but he couldn't connect;
49.3;4;Bresnan to Smith, FOUR runs lovely shot, this innings could be a game-changer, he gets down on one knee and dinks it over the short fine leg for four;
49.2;2;Bresnan to Smith, 2 runs full and straight, good bowling, Smith squeezes out a drive and some top running allows him to come back for two;
49.1;1;Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run Clarke gets a single straight away, might just be best for Australia that, mistiming a drive to mid off;
48.6;4;Anderson to Smith, FOUR runs lovely shot to finish, really top shot, it was full and Smith whipped it into the gap in front of midwicket for four. Could be very important runs these last two balls;
48.5;4;Anderson to Smith, FOUR runs oh dear, poor ball this, short and down the leg side, Smith helped it on its way and collected four;
48.5;2w;Anderson to Clarke, 2 wide oops! This must have just got stuck in Anderson's hands, it was so, so short, almost pitched on the bowler's feet, looped up miles over the batman, with enough time to collect a bye as well;
48.4;1b;Anderson to Smith, 1 bye goodness me, if Smith had connected here this ball would still be travelling, slow bouncer, and an enormous swipe is missed, went one-bounce to Kieswetter who fumbled and allowed a bye;
48.3;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run good bowling from Anderson, landing those old-fashioned, death-over yorkers and Clarke can only jab it down the ground for one;
48.2;W;Anderson to Clarke, OUT well, suicidal running from Hussey. Clarke murdered a drive straight to Strauss at extra cover, Hussey ran for a single which was never these, Strauss calmly threw back to Anderson, who took the bails off and Hussey had no chance of getting back in time;Michael Hussey run out (Anderson/Strauss) 1 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;

47.2;W;Broad to White, OUT gone this time! White couldn't quite going and here he tried to smash a short ball out the ground, couldn't get much of it and Anderson took an easy catch on the square leg boundary;Cameron White c Anderson b Broad 17 (24m 16b 1x4 0x6) SR: 106.25;
47.1;?;Broad to White, no run White backs away, giving himself plenty of room to swing his big arms, but he can't quite time it and it trickles to cover;

46.5;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run Clarke can't find a big shot here, but he does collect one to cover;
46.4;1;Anderson to White, 1 run this time he connects more fully, without much timing and collects one to mid on;
46.3;4;Anderson to White, FOUR runs well, it wasn't quite where bear-man White planned, but he'll take all of it, he aimed an enormous slog, it came off the outside edge, zipping wide of short third man for four;
46.2;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run short ball here, slower again, Clarke pulls but without much power and picks out deep midwicket;

21.5;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run Anderson gets away with this, shoved full and down the leg side but Clarke misses the leg-side flick;
21.4;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run Clarke is really throwing his hands at the ball outside off stump, the pitch is very true so he can get away with it, but the timing is not quite there;

8.3;?;Broad to Watson, no run this skids through a fraction outside off stump, Watson aims a cut shot but it's a touch too close for the shot and it ghosts past the edge;

5.6;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run very good, the two boundaries that ended the last over were followed by a maiden here from Bresnan, just restricting Australia's run rate;

0.1;?;Anderson to Watson, no run tidy start from Anderson, zipping an outswinger past off stump and Watson leaves it alone;

12.55pm Right, enough chatter. The players are out there. Shane Watson and Tim Paine have by far been the best thing Australia's batting has offered and a good start here on a good wicket would be crucial. For England, James Anderson has been in fine form, but Tim Bresnan is yet to take a wicket this series.
12.45pm Here's something awfully topical from Robert Brown "Is it true that ex Prime minister Kevin Rudd is the next ICC vice president because he knocked over Howard in their last match?"
12.40pm Not long to go now so just to remind you, if you're in Europe (but not in the UK) you can watch this match and the rest of the series on our ESPN player.
12.35pm England have won the toss and will field. England go in with an unchanged team and adopt and unchanged gameplan. Australia too are unchanged and Ponting, flinty-eyed as ever, understandably wants to see more from his batsmen.
12.30pm Now, some intriguing news we've received (presumably by pigeon carrier) is that all power around the local area at The Oval is down.... Having just said that, the lights are back on at the press box. Which is all that matters.
Right, scrap all that. Drama over. Lights switching on everywhere again, scoreboard gleaming.
12.25pm Brydon Coverdale, another Cricinfo has been watching the Aussies warm-up and has spotted a returning figure. "Mitchell Johnson was having a bowl in the nets earlier, to Shaun Marsh. He looked like he's over his elbow infection. He should be well and truly right for the two T20s against Pakistan." How Australia have missed him in this series.
12.10pm Hello and a very, very warm welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the 4th ODI from The Oval. England are 3-0 up. What?
I'm Sahil Dutta, I'll be joined later in the day by Liam Brickhill and there will be regular bulletins from Andrew Miller, who is at The Oval, as we all try to work out what's going on.
England are even entertaining thoughts of a whitewash. Premature perhaps, but that's where we find ourselves. For their part, Australia have a lot to fight for in this series. Not just 'pride' (that wonderful euphemism for dead games) but also because, try as we might, it's difficult to ignore the Ashes tower looming in the background to this series. While a 3-2 result would be forgotten by the time we reach Brisbane in November, 5-0 might just linger.
Anyway, Andrew Miller's preview tells you much more and includes an unlikely statistic about England's longest run of successive ODI victories against Australia, so do check that out. While we wait for the toss, you could also check out Peter Roebuck's column which gushes lyrically that "Strauss's boys are full of a new attitude, defined by resilience, optimism and unbreakability". Indeed.
 Innings Start
No whitewash for England, they never got close today. Ponting and Clarke finally gave the Australian bowlers something to work with, and England, chasing a daunting total, could never get going as Harris ran through the top order.
Important win for Australia, with Tait in the side their bowling has a touch more devil and it has made a real difference. It was a return to the old Australia really, powerful and professional. For their part, England looked a touch flat throughout. Anyway, Brydon Coverdale will have a much more revealing assessment in his bulletin, which will be ready for you shortly, so check that out.
Strauss: "Disappointing day, the batting was a bit of a return to the old days, lost too many wickets too quickly and it's always hard to keep the runrate in check when you lose wickets too early."
Ponting: "We've played a lot better today, our batting was back at the level it should be. Shaun Tait has forced the opposition on the back foot and I'll be talking to him about reversing his decision to give up the longer form of the game! It's been a frustrating series but the boys bounced back well today."
Ryan Harris is named man of the match and says he's happy to perform well today after disappointing at Old Trafford.
Right, that's just about it from us today. Thanks for all the emails, and I hope you'll join us on Saturday for the final game from Lord's.

23.3;?;Smith to Morgan, no run nothing for Morgan here as he defends quietly off the front foot;
23.2;1;Smith to Yardy, 1 run touch short from Smith, in less circumspect times Yardy might have had a swipe at that, here he is content to push for a single to mid on;
23.1;2;Smith to Yardy, 2 runs Yardy will be pleased with this, picking the gap in front of square on the leg side with a crisp sweep to collect a couple;
22.6;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run good finish from Hopes, on a length, on a line and Morgan defends;
22.5;2;Hopes to Morgan, 2 runs ooh, the pressure almost told there, Morgan sliced an airy drive, but it avoided the fielders and he collected a couple to deep cover;
22.4;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run cracking stuff from Hopes, giving nothing away, Morgan can only defend;
22.3;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run Morgan tries to manufacture something here, giving himself some room, but he's hurried on a cut shot and can't time it;
22.2;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run this time it's a tighter line and Morgan can only defend;
22.1;2;Hopes to Morgan, 2 runs good cricket this, more bustling, accurate medium from Hopes, Morgan flicks it in front of square on the leg side to collect a couple;
21.6;?;Smith to Yardy, no run nicely bowled, touch of air and thrown up outside off inviting a drive, Yardy obliged and didn't time it;
21.5;1;Smith to Morgan, 1 run Morgan keeps England ticking with a gentle push in front of the wicket on the leg side for a single;
21.4;1;Smith to Yardy, 1 run nicely bowled from Smith, flatter and quicker, Yardy played it very carefully towards mid on for one;
21.3;1;Smith to Morgan, 1 run Morgan repeats the dose, nudging a single into the leg side;
21.2;1;Smith to Yardy, 1 run this time it's worked away into the midwicket region for a single;
21.1;4;Smith to Yardy, FOUR runs nicely played by Yardy, down on one knee and sweeping very crisply backward of square for four to bring up England's hundred;
20.6;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run Hopes's military-medium is working well here, on off stump and Morgan can't squeeze a cut shot away;
20.5;1;Hopes to Yardy, 1 run Yardy gets another chance to play the shot, and does so, guiding it down the third man for one;
20.4;?;Hopes to Yardy, no run pushed across the left hander, was there for a cut shot, which Yardy plays, but misses;
20.3;?;Hopes to Yardy, no run hopes really marching around busily, which suits his new shaven head, and lands this on middle stump for Yardy to defend;
20.2;1;Hopes to Morgan, 1 run this time Morgan manages to flick it to midwicket for a single;
20.1;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run good stuff from Hopes, maintaining a tight line and Morgan defends;

19.5;?;Smith to Morgan, no run this time he plays the shot a touch more circumspectly, working it along the ground;
19.4;4;Smith to Morgan, FOUR runs well, how about that! Lovely shot from Morgan, stuck his foot outside off stump and flicked it over midwicket for four;
19.3;1;Smith to Yardy, 1 run Yardy starts well enough, pushing into the covers for one;
19.2;W;Smith to PD Collingwood, OUT great response from Smith and Collingwood has gone! Top stuff from Smith, but Collingwood looks unlucky here, he pushed forward to defend and the ball rapped him on the front pad, looked outside the line though;Paul Collingwood lbw b Smith 15 (38m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 78.94;
19.1;4;Smith to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs Collingwood committed to a sweep very early, but played the shot superbly, picking a gap at fine, fine leg and dabbing it just where he planned for four;
18.6;1;Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run touch slower from Hopes and Collingwood eases it down to long on for a strike-stealing single;
18.5;1lb;Hopes to Morgan, 1 leg bye once again Morgan looking for the leg-side whip, but can't connect and it thuds off the pads for a single;
18.4;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run nothing here, just dabbed into the cover region;
18.3;2;Hopes to Morgan, 2 runs good running again from these two, Morgan whipped it down to fine leg, where a good sliding stop on the boundary could have kept it to one, but he was back in a flash;
18.2;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run touch fuller, Morgan aims a drive but doesn't time it at all;
18.1;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run good from Hopes, nothing fancy, just busy, back of a length outside off and Morgan blocks;
17.6;2;Smith to PD Collingwood, 2 runs good running from Collingwood earns two as he tickled this round the corner towards backward square leg;
17.5;1;Smith to Morgan, 1 run poor ball, deserved more than it got, was very short and Morgan pulled hard but out to deep midwicket;
17.4;1;Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run too short and Collingwood cuts, firmly, but to the deep point fielder;
17.3;?;Smith to PD Collingwood, no run good ball from Smith, classic legspinner's stock, pitching around leg, spinning away, Collingwood is forward and blocks;
17.2;1;Smith to Morgan, 1 run this time it's more secure from Morgan, chipping down the crease again and working it for a single in front of square on the leg side;
17.1;2;Smith to Morgan, 2 runs ooh, close here, Morgan's greeted Smith by dancing down the wicket and flicking airily through midwicket, only just out the reach of a diving Ponting;
16.6;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run good finish from Hopes and it's full-faced back to the bowler;
16.5;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run this time it's on a line and length and Collingwood pushes it back to the bowler;
16.4;2;Hopes to PD Collingwood, 2 runs Collingwood managed to get this away for a couple, good calm stuff from him;
16.3;1;Hopes to Morgan, 1 run drifting a fraction down the leg side, Morgan tickles it round the corner for one;
16.2;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run good ball here, nothing for Morgan to latch on to, so instead it's tapped gently back to the bowler;
16.1;1;Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run Hopes lands his busy right-arm medium on and around off stump, Collingwood must recognise the bowling as reminiscent of his own, and guides it to third man for one;
15.6;?;Tait to Morgan, no run angles it across Morgan, who eagerly shoulders arms, which means Tait has bowled two maidens in a row now;
15.5;?;Tait to Morgan, no run this is actually short and wide outside off, I reckon any other bowler and Morgan would have had a dart at it, instead he leaves it alone;
15.4;?;Tait to Morgan, no run this was a short one, but there was nothing slow about it, England look like they've decided to see Tait out, and Morgan sways out the way of it;
15.3;?;Tait to Morgan, no run no slower-ball bouncers from Tait, just full and very very quick, Morgan eases into a forward defence;
15.2;?;Tait to Morgan, no run this is swift stuff from Tait and Morgan hurries into a defensive block;
15.1;?;Tait to Morgan, no run Morgan is content at the moment to leave Tait's rockets alone outside off stump;
14.6;2;Hopes to PD Collingwood, 2 runs punched firmly to mid-off, where Bollinger just about cuts it off;
14.5;1;Hopes to Morgan, 1 run and he follows that up with a little dink behind square to pick up the single;
14.4;6;Hopes to Morgan, SIX runs thumped! Morgan is in a confident mood, as Hopes sends one down fuller and he lifts it handsomely way over long-on. Effortless, all balance and timing;
14.3;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run straight, and Morgan defends back down the track;
14.2;1;Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run slightly wider, Collingwood runs the ball down to third man;
14.1;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run nice start, full on off stump and slanting in to Collingwood, who defends towards point;
13.6;?;Tait to Morgan, no run fuller, and flashed behind square on the off side, but well-stopped by a tumbling backward point;
13.5;?;Tait to Morgan, no run slightly wider still, and again Morgan leaves;
13.4;?;Tait to Morgan, no run slightly wider of off, and Morgan leaves well alone;
13.3;?;Tait to Morgan, no run quick, and Morgan toe-ends to slip, along the ground though;
13.2;W;Tait to Strauss, OUT edged and gone! Well, that curved away from Strauss very late to take the edge of his bat, and Paine takes a regulation catch behind. Tait strikes, and Australia continue to chip away at England as they chase a win that could at least give them some pride;Andrew Strauss c ?Paine b Tait 37 (61m 45b 5x4 0x6) SR: 82.22;
13.1;?;Tait to Strauss, no run goes full to start, and Strauss drives a little leaden-footed to extra cover;
12.6;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run mightily nurdled to leg, but straight to midwicket so no run;
12.5;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run full, driven very hard on the up but straight to extra cover;
12.4;1;Harris to Strauss, 1 run Strauss shuffles down the track and drives firmly past the straightish midwicket, but a deep-ish mid-on sprints round to cut the ball off;
12.3;?;Harris to Strauss, no run chopped to gully, Colly was thinking about the cheeky single but Strauss sends him back;
12.2;?;Harris to Strauss, no run clipped straight to the close midwicket this time;
12.1;2;Harris to Strauss, 2 runs worked to leg, in front of deep midwicket and so they charge through for the second. He couldn't pick the ball up cleanly anyway, so easy runs in the end;
11.6;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run walks across his stumps once again, and punches firmly to mid-on. More orthordox, less nurdley;
11.5;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run Colly walks right across to the off side this time and unleashes a nurdle to leg, but straight to the fielder;
11.4;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run very full outside off from over the wicket, Collingwood drives but the ball squirts off the toe-end of the bat and trickles to mid-off;
11.3;1;Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run little shuffle to off, and worked to midwicket for one;
11.2;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run back of a length on off, Strauss tries to guide the ball to third man but can't beat the man at gully;
11.1;2;Bollinger to Strauss, 2 runs just too straight, and Strauss nudges through midwicket, placing the ball well enough to warrant a second;
10.6;1;Harris to Strauss, 1 run chopped down just behind square, backward point ran in but they committed to the single and it's safe in the end;
10.5;?;Harris to Strauss, no run on a length on off stump, tapped defensively to cover;
10.4;1;Harris to PD Collingwood, 1 run nurdle to leg, and he's off the mark straight away;
10.3;W;Harris to Pietersen, OUT Harris strikes again! Pietersen went right across to the offside and aimed an extravagant flick over the leg-side but is struck on the back pad. Huge appeal from Australia, and the umpire agrees! Pietersen isn't happy, giving a long glance at the umpire as he trudges off, but that was stone dead, hitting middle and leg halfway up;Kevin Pietersen lbw b Harris 8 (7m 6b 2x4 0x6) SR: 133.33;
10.2;1;Harris to Strauss, 1 run well, an uncharacteristically ungainly pull from Strauss as Harris sends one down a bit shorter. He found himself in no position to play the shot but just went through with it. That was a bit hoicky...;
10.1;?;Harris to Strauss, no run on a length, straight and pushed to mid-on;
9.6;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run thumped down the ground again! But that's clattered into the stumps at the non-striker's end, and the crowd let out a collective groan as the ball goes nowhere...;
9.5;4;Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs he pulls the length back a touch, but Pietersen drives on the up straight down the ground, beating a diving Ponting at mid-on! Two in two;
9.4;4;Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs crack! Full, wide, and Pietersen absolutely hammers a drive through the covers. The ball raced to the boundary in a flash!;
9.3;1;Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run closer to the stumps, and Strauss opens the face of the blade to guide the ball behind square on the off side;
9.2;4;Bollinger to Strauss, FOUR runs so he sends one down short and wide on the off side, and Strauss cracks a cut right out of the middle of the bat to send the ball racing to the backward point boundary;
9.1;2;Bollinger to Strauss, 2 runs a touch straight, and Strauss nudges him away behind square on the leg side.;
8.6;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run slightly fuller, punched firmly to mid-off;
8.5;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run on a length, Pietersen moves nicely across and defends back down the track;
8.4;W;Harris to Kieswetter, OUT clatter! Harris sent one down much fuller and Kieswetter went for the drive, leaving an enormous gap between bat and pad. There was a touch of wobble on the ball, and some seam movement in after pitching to squirt through the gap and smash into the top of off stump! Harris, who is obviously fired up, gives him a bit of a send-off;Craig Kieswetter b Harris 12 (36m 23b 1x4 0x6) SR: 52.17;
8.3;2;Harris to Kieswetter, 2 runs nicely played by Kieswetter, the ball was similar to the one before but this time he just angled the bat face to send the ball to third man's right. Tait runs around, but in the meantime they pick up two;
8.2;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run back of a length on off stump, and Kieswetter gets up on his toes to ride the bounce and defend to off;
8.1;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run too straight, Kieswetter glances to leg but can't beat the man at short fine;
7.6;?;Tait to Strauss, no run full, and very fast indeed. Strauss pushes forward and opens the face to send the ball to backward point;
7.5;?;Tait to Strauss, no run Strauss shuffles across to the off side and works the ball straight to midwicket;
7.4;1;Tait to Kieswetter, 1 run feisty stuff! That was the bouncer, and was reasonably well-directed - not too short, and Kieswetter is hurried into a hook down to fine leg;
7.3;?;Tait to Kieswetter, no run fuller this time, and Kieswetter is simply beaten for pace as he pushes half-forward to drive but the ball is upon him before he's properly into the shot, and trickles into the off side;
7.2;?;Tait to Kieswetter, no run shortish again, just outside off and Kieswetter pushes defensively to point;
7.1;?;Tait to Kieswetter, no run back of a length and quick, but Kieswetter hops into a backfoot defensive and plays the ball down under his eyes;
6.6;4;Harris to Strauss, FOUR runs great intent from Strauss, as again he charges down the track to get to the pitch and cracks the ball very hard infront of square on the off side. Four runs! And shades of one Matty Hayden...;
6.5;?;Harris to Strauss, no run beaten outside off! Wasn't there for the cut, but he went for a flashing front-foot square drive. A little bit of seam movement and the ball whizzed past the edge;
6.4;1;Harris to Kieswetter, 1 run Kieswetter tries to relieve the pressure, shimmying to leg and flashing at the ball, which squirts off the outer half of the bat down to third man. Gully would've snaffled that;
6.3;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run Harris has been exemplary so far, hurling the ball down at good pace but finding accuracy too - and Kieswetter defends again;
6.2;1;Harris to Strauss, 1 run on a length just outside off, and Strauss opens the face to send the ball to third man;
6.1;1;Harris to Kieswetter, 1 run tapped to midwicket, and he's immediately called through for a quick single;
5.6;?;Tait to Strauss, no run ah, the change-up to finish, as Tait sends down a slower-ball yorker outside off. I say slower, it was still around 80mph...;
5.5;?;Tait to Strauss, no run wow, this has been a very quick over from Tait - high 90s mph. Strauss is hurried into a prod to cover;
5.4;?;Tait to Strauss, no run fuller this time, outside off, and driven - but straight to cover;
5.3;?;Tait to Strauss, no run punched to cover off the back foot;
5.2;2;Tait to Strauss, 2 runs dropped! It was a good ball just outside off, Strauss pushes at it and gets a thick edge which flies to Watto at first slip... but he can't hold on! The ball was really motoring, but he just couldn't wrap the hands round it;
5.1;4;Tait to Strauss, FOUR runs very fast to start... but short and wide, and Strauss slams a cut over backward point to pick up four!;
4.6;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run tight finish, zoning in on off stump and Kieswetter responds with a solid-looking forward defensive;
4.5;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run off the inside edge, going between his back leg and the stumps and down to short fine leg. That was too close for comfort...;
4.4;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run watchful start from Kieswetter, who leaves alone outside off once again;
4.3;1;Harris to Strauss, 1 run full on off stump, Strauss drives strongly down the ground but mid-off runs round in a flash to cut it off cleanly and keep them to one;
4.2;?;Harris to Strauss, no run Strauss misses a pull this time! Again, the shot was on, but now he plays over the top of it as the ball scoots over off stump;
4.1;?;Harris to Strauss, no run Strauss is beaten again outside off, but this time the ball was there to be hit. Short and wide, you'd back Strauss to put that away, but it just bounced a fraction more than he was expecting;
3.6;?;Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run full again, but pitching outside off and angled across him from over the wicket and Kieswetter raises his bat up and out of the way to leave;
3.5;?;Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run a touch fuller, and Kieswetter presses forward to defend. Probing stuff so far from Bollinger;
3.4;?;Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run good stuff from Bollinger, as Kieswetter pushes at one angled across him and is beaten as well. He pulled the bat inside the line, but only after the ball was already past him;
3.3;1;Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run aggressive from Strauss, as he backs to leg and slaps the ball to cover. Just the one run though;
3.2;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run beaten outside off! Bollinger bends his back and finds some bounce outside off to beat a slightly airy woft by England's captain;
3.1;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run a touch full on off stump, Strauss drives firmly to mid-off;
2.6;2;Harris to Kieswetter, 2 runs too straight, too full, and he's worked away to deep midwicket where Hussey cuts the ball off and hurls in a return;
2.5;1;Harris to Strauss, 1 run good fielding from Ponting saves runs! That was even fuller and again Strauss launched into a drive, timing it much better this time, but the 35-year-old in the covers tumbles athletically to his left to cut it off;
2.4;?;Harris to Strauss, no run fuller, and Strauss is drawn into a drive. Not quite there to be hit, though, and the ball goes softly to mid-off;
2.3;?;Harris to Strauss, no run nice, accurate stuff from Harris as Strauss chops defensively to point;
2.2;1;Harris to Kieswetter, 1 run on a length, but on the hips and he's clipped to midwicket;
2.1;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run emotive appeal first ball as he sends one down full and the ball strikes pad then bat as Kieswetter defends. Too close for the umpire to pick though, so not out;
1.6;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run Strauss shapes to clip to leg but is too early in the shot and gets himself in a bit of a tangle, and the ball heads back down the wicket instead. Bollinger leaps across in his follow-through to cut it off;
1.5;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run just keep it there! On a length, around off and nothing for Strauss to work with;
1.4;4;Bollinger to Strauss, FOUR runs slapped away behind square on the off side! Bollinger is just feeding Strauss's strengths here, giving him width outside off and he's laced away behind point as a result;
1.3;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run much fuller, and it's cracked to mid on;
1.2;4;Bollinger to Strauss, FOUR runs too short, and Strauss is in position in a flash to thump a pull up and over midwicket. He trusts the bounce in the wicket and went through with the shot;
1.1;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run good start, on a length around off stump and Strauss defends back down the wicket;
0.6;?;Tait to Kieswetter, no run a touch of width again, but he pulled the length back and Kieswetter is quite happy to leave;
0.5;4;Tait to Kieswetter, FOUR runs width, and Kieswetter seizes upon it in fine fashion with a crunching cover drive. Right out the middle, and well-placed too, in the gap and away for four;
0.4;?;Tait to Kieswetter, no run ooh, almost the delivery he got him with in the last game. Very full, and very fast, but Kieswetter punches to mid on with the full face of the bat;
0.4;1w;Tait to Kieswetter, 1 wide not quite adjusted to the change of line to the right-hander, as this one squirts down the leg side;
0.3;1lb;Tait to Strauss, 1 leg bye back of a length and very sharp. Strauss shapes to tuck the ball to leg but can't quite get it away, but Kieswetter calls him through for a quick single straight away;
0.2;?;Tait to Strauss, no run shorter this time, not quite the bouncer but that leapt disconcertingly up at Strauss, who did very well to keep his eye on the ball and play it down;
0.1;?;Tait to Strauss, no run much better, on a length and fired at off stump. Strauss hops back to defend;
0.1;1w;Tait to Strauss, 1 wide pace to start, but not much direction as he sprays one very wide of off stump from over the wicket;

Right, the players are heading back out. Strauss and Kieswetter stride to the crease to tones of 'Jerusalem', and it'll be Liam Brickhill to kick things off on commentary. Shaun Tait will open the bowling for Australia
