Data
So Australia finish with a respectable 286. Michael Hussey has had a bit of a rough time lately, but he was back at his best today. There were plenty of cameos as well to help Australia recover from a slow start. Brad Haddin was scratchy but got some valuable runs at the top, Callum Ferguson was watchful in his 25, while Hopes was more cavalier as Australia looked for quick runs.
For South Africa, Johan Botha was immaculate again, the quick bowlers were impressive early on but leaked too many at the death.
It's still a pretty good pitch to bat on, and this should be a cracking contest, particularly with Smith v Johnson at the top.
This is Siddarth Ravindran, with Raju doing the scoring. We'll be back in a bit for the chase.

Great start from South Africa's new-ball bowlers
 Innings Start
South Africa have received an absolute hiding here, the introduction of Nathan Hauritz completely transformed the game. None of the batsmen were really comfortable against him, who was unafraid to toss the ball up and got the rewards. James Hopes also did a sterling support job, stifling the runs with his unerring accuracy. Mitchell Johnson did his bit, breaking the Smith and Gibbs stand, and consistently maintaining a scorching pace.
Australia had also struggled initially when they batted but they managed to string together a bunch of partnerships, something South Africa were unable to do. Australia bowled well but a number of South African wickets were soft dismissals In hindsight, Boucher at No. 6 seems a place too high. Another sore point for South Africa will be 91 runs they leaked in the last 10 overs, after Australia were under the cosh at 197 for 5 at the 40-over mark.
At the post-match presentation, Smith says: "Australia probably got 20-30 more, and the wicket slowed up in the evening, the ball didn't really come along". He also praises Hussey's knock and Hauritz's bowling
Michael Hussey is the Man of the Match. When asked about his slump, he says: "It happens to every player, hopefully it doesn't last too long. " He also says it's been amazing to be in South Africa as part of Australia's Test series winning squad.
Ponting also says the wickets was slower than he expected, and is full of praise for Hauritz.
Both captains say the timing of the Powerplays is proving to be a bit of a headache.
So the trend of the results following the same pattern as in the series in Australia continues. Join us to see whether it extends to Sunday's game in Centurion as well.
This is Siddarth Ravindran signing off, thanks to everyone for your mails. See you on Sunday.
