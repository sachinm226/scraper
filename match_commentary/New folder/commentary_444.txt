Jake: "I sometimes wonder why Mitch isnt asked to open the batting when the ball is hard and coming on to the bat. Give him a licence to cut loose. What would you lose? He can be very damaging on his day."
Michael Clarke will be proud of his batting performance in his first match as official captain. It was a difficult pitch to bat on, but he went about his task serenely, using his feet almost each time to the spinners. Ricky Ponting looked in supreme touch as he got going with a flurry of boundaries, but his run out and Watson;s dismissal put the responsibility squarely on Clarke, and how has he responded, getting 101 when the next best score is 37.
Shakib was miserly with the ball, but was let down by his other bowlers, especially the spinners who overdid the leg stump line, allowing easy singles. This will be a difficult chase, join us in some time.
Andrew: "The silence is deafening - can you all stop bagging on Clarke now and to your attention to non performers such as White/Smith?"

 Innings Start
That will be all from us for this game. You can catch all the action from the IPL here. This is Abhishek Purohit signing off along with Gopi Rangarajan. Cheers.
Hang on for the presentation, folks.
Michael Clarke, also the Man of the Match: "Pretty happy. Wicket was quite slow, but once you got in, it was a good wicket to bat. I thought we hung in there, they have got lots of spinners, they have a lot of talent. Our execution could improve. We are not bowling the yorker often enough, very happy to make a 100 today."
Shakib Al Hasan: "We did not bowl well. You cannot chase 270 in this wicket. The ball was keeping low, it was hard to chase. We haven't had a good time at the World Cup, and hopefully we will do well next time. We have to stick together, and keep executing our plans. tamim batted sensibly, did not take many chances, that is what we want from him, may be he will learn from his mistakes and convert his 50s in to 100s."
Irfan: "Look at the brighter side for Bangladesh, Aussies lost 7 wickets in 50 overs and Bangladesh lost only 5."
Sajib: "Call me nuts, but 58 is more acceptable to me than 210, if some intention for winning is there."
Nahim: "Shakib is going to take a 'lot of positives' from this game at the press conference."
Priyam: "Finally the torture for Bangladeshi fans ends... at least for today. Wonder what excuse Shakib will come up with."
So Michael Clarke has a comprehensive win in his first win as official Australia captain. Bangladesh never attempted to go for the target after losing a couple of early wickets, and just went through the motions of playing out the 50 overs.
