Data
It's KL Rahul who will open alongside Rohit Sharma.
Dilan: "Is this score good enough in this ground with the Indian batting line up and the form KL is on?" --- I'd reckon about 15-20 short, but they have the bowling to make every run hard.
5.42pm Percy: "What's the update on Dhawan?" --- None yet, as we get ready to witness India's chase



Right, so Debayan will take you through the first 10 overs after the lunch break. Meanwhile, how about a football teaser?
In what used to be the Premier League's marquee clash, Liverpool host Manchester United later tonight. They're on course to lift the trophy, but can they break Man City's points record, or match Arsenal's Invincibles? A close assessment of their run-in suggests they will fall just short.
49.6;1;Shami to Agar, 1 run superb from Shami. Finishes with another yorker, and Australia can only manage to get one off the final delivery. Superb final 10 overs from India. Only 63 runs conceded, and India need 287 to win the game, and the series.;
49.5;1;Shami to Hazlewood, 1 run gets off the mark with a run down to mid-off;
49.4;1;Shami to Agar, 1 run in the blockhole again, and they only get a single;
49.3;1lb;Shami to Hazlewood, 1 leg bye backs away and Shami follows him. gets a leg bye and gets the strike back to Agar;
49.2;W;Shami to Zampa, OUT cleans up Zampa! Shami just keeps picking up wickets. Inswinging full ball, Zampa tries to go big, it comes off his pad and smashes into leg stump;Adam Zampa b Mohammed Shami 1 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
49.1;1;Shami to Agar, 1 run low full toss, helped along to deep midwicket from Agar, but no more than one;
48.6;?;Bumrah to Zampa, no run finds the fielder again. Just 5 from that over;
48.5;1;Bumrah to Agar, 1 run driven down the side for one;
48.4;1;Bumrah to Zampa, 1 run driven in the air to sweeper cover. Australia now up to 280;
48.3;1;Bumrah to Agar, 1 run gets a single through the offside;
48.2;1lb;Bumrah to Zampa, 1 leg bye dragged down legside, and Rahul fails to gather it. Lucky fine leg clears up, so it's just 1 run instead of 4;
48.1;1lb;Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye into the pads, and Agar comes through for a leg bye. Can Bumrah clean up this innings here and now?;
47.6;?;Shami to Zampa, no run driven back. Splendid over. 3 runs and 2 wickets.;
47.5;?;Shami to Zampa, no run Zampa tamely drives it through the covers. Surprised Shami didn't go for the yorker again;
47.4;W;Shami to Cummins, OUT and he's accounted for Cummins first ball again. Just the same way as in Rajkot. The yorker is simply too good for Cummins to get any bat on. It goes underneath and castles him first ball.;Pat Cummins b Mohammed Shami 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
47.3;1;Shami to Agar, 1 run inswinging yorker, that's the ball he needs to bowl as much of as possible. Agar can do little but run it off the face and take the single;
47.2;2;Shami to Agar, 2 runs guided through the on-side field, and comes back for two. He needs to play a big part here;
47.1;W;Shami to Smith, OUT Smith holes out to deep midwicket! Tried to play a similar shot to that flick that went for six a couple of overs ago and Iyer completes a brilliant catch charging in and diving forward. Big wicket, that, could lop about 20-25 runs off the score, potentially.;Steven Smith c Iyer b Mohammed Shami 131 (132b 14x4 1x6) SR: 99.24;
46.6;1;Bumrah to Smith, 1 run placed it around cow corner. Realised too late he could have had two. Settles for the one. Still, a dozen off that over;
46.5;1lb;Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye gets away with that. Dragged down leg, and Agar can only get his pad to it and come through for another leg bye;
46.4;1;Bumrah to Smith, 1 run opens the face and runs it down to the sweeper. 10 off four balls;
46.3;4;Bumrah to Smith, FOUR runs two in a row. Bumrah finally copping some punishment at Smiths hands. Another slower delivery well outside off stump. Poor delivery in truth, and Smith is too hot right now to miss out on that;
46.2;4;Bumrah to Smith, FOUR runs Smith wins the ball for now. Saw third man was inside the circle, and deliberately edges the ball fine of him to get the boundary. This is world-class batting against tough bowling;
46.1;1lb;Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye smacks Agar on the pad, and he runs through for the leg-bye. Right, Smith and Bumrah. What a contest;
45.6;2;Saini to Smith, 2 runs worked away to cow corner, and placed it nicely enough he was able to come back for 2. 16 off the over. Australia need at least a couple more like that;
45.5;1;Saini to Agar, 1 run finally nails the yorker. Agar digs it out and gets Smith back on strike for the final ball of the over;
45.4;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run gets a single to the offside. 13 off the first four. Can Agar support Smith here in making this a gigantic over?;
45.3;6;Saini to Smith, SIX runs what an absolutely nonsensical shot that is. Absolutely ridiculous. Just outside off, and SMith moves across, and simply wrists it in the air over deep square leg. Sails away for six. That was all wrist.;
45.2;2;Saini to Smith, 2 runs runs this to the right of third man and calls "two" straightaway. Good start from Australia, can they make this a big over?;
45.1;4;Saini to Smith, FOUR runs and the four finally comes! Yorker that Smith opened the face of the bat to angle past backward point. Excellent shot;
44.6;1;Shami to Smith, 1 run spanks it to cow corner, but they can't manage any more than a single. 7 off the over;
44.5;1;Shami to Agar, 1 run guides it down to sweeper cover. just 6 off the first five balls;
44.4;1;Shami to Smith, 1 run cramps him for room, but Smith manages to whack it to mid-on;
44.3;1;Shami to Agar, 1 run timed to mid-off and Agar hastily runs across; he wants to get Smith back on strike. India won't mind these crumbs whatsoever;
44.2;1;Shami to Smith, 1 run driven down to long-on;
44.1;2;Shami to Smith, 2 runs driven back past the bowler and a dive from Chahal prevents it from crossing the boundary;
43.6;W;Saini to Turner, OUT marvellous delivery to finish. Yorker just outside off stump, goes underneath the bat. India re stifling Australia here. And what's this? India have reviewed for a caught behind! The UltraEdge shows a spike when the ball touches the bat. He's gone! Smart review by Kohli; the wicket came from nowhere;Ashton Turner c ?Rahul b Saini 4 (10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40;
43.5;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run nice timing, and what's happened now? Smith ran through for a single, and Ashton Turner wasn't even looking at him. A throw at the keeper's end would have produced a wicket;
43.4;1;Saini to Turner, 1 run yorker, they scurry through for one. The throw hits Smith as he lunges to get back into the crease;
43.3;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run there it is. Runs it down to third man and brings up his ninth ODI hundred, and third against India. It's been a commanding knock. Not much of a celebration. Knows there's more work to be done;
43.2;?;Saini to Smith, no run drives smartly to backward point, who collects sharply. Turner wanted the run, but Smith is taking no chances;
43.1;1;Saini to Turner, 1 run quick single, was desperate to get Smith back on strike. And now, hwre's Smith on 99;
42.6;1;Bumrah to Turner, 1 run runs it down to the deep cover fielder. Turner keeps the strike again. Smith will have to wait a while longer!;
42.5;?;Bumrah to Turner, no run five in a row. Almost squared him up. Can Bumrah actually bowl a maiden over here?;
42.4;?;Bumrah to Turner, no run back of a length, pushed to the covers. No run in this over so far;
42.3;?;Bumrah to Turner, no run and again. This man produces on demand. He bowls yorkers with more consistency than I make a good cup of tea. And that's a real compliment;
42.2;?;Bumrah to Turner, no run wonderful bowling. Perfect yorker, and all Turner can do is not let the ball go under his bat;
42.1;?;Bumrah to Turner, no run beaten by the ball keeping low. Thick under-edge;
41.6;1;Kuldeep to Turner, 1 run helped down to third man. Turner keeps the strike;
41.5;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run drives to long-on, and moves to 99.;
41.4;W;Kuldeep to Carey, OUT played with the turn, and the wicket finally comes!. Lofted it over cover, and looked a pretty good shot, in all fairness. But because he was reaching for it outside off stump, he never could get the purchase he needed to clear the ropes. Big wicket for Kuldeep in his final over;Alex Carey c Iyer b Kuldeep Yadav 35 (36b 6x4 0x6) SR: 97.22;
41.3;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run cut away, produces only a single;
41.2;1;Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run drops it short, lucky Carey only finds the sweeper with a crunch through the covers;
41.1;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run wrong 'un, driven away to sweeper cover;
40.6;?;Shami to Carey, no run slower delivery, smart bowling to close out the over. Depriving Carey of the pace he was looking to use. Well-rescued over in the end;
40.5;?;Shami to Carey, no run shows Shami the stumps again. Backed away, but couldn't quite find a productive shot to go with it;
40.4;4;Shami to Carey, FOUR runs clever cricket. Clears the front leg, moves away to give himself room and crunches it through the offside. Races away to the boundary;
40.3;?;Shami to Carey, no run good delivery, seams back in to Carey, who simply played down the wrong line and found his inside edge beaten;
40.2;?;Shami to Carey, no run tried to run it down to third man, can't quite beat the backward point fielder;
40.1;1;Shami to Smith, 1 run touched away to square leg;
39.6;4;Bumrah to Carey, FOUR runs short, and he looks to drive this. Off the outside edge, and third man fails to reel it in. Off Saini's hands and touches the fence.;
39.5;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run looks for the yorker, but overcooks it. Carey drives, but cannot beat mid-on;
39.4;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run fuller length, and he drives this towards cover;
39.3;1;Bumrah to Smith, 1 run length, runs it down to third man;

37.6;1;Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run loops one outside off in the air, in going for the slog sweep! Got absolutely no timing on it, and it lands limply around the mid-wicket region, with no fielder in the immediate vicinity. Lucky Carey on this occasion;
37.5;2;Kuldeep to Carey, 2 runs length, around off, and he sweeps this towards deep backward square leg. A fielder sweeping at the deep mid-wicket fence gets around to his left to save two for his team;
37.4;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run length, and he skips down the wicket to hit this hard towards long-on. Bowled at 78.4kph;
37.3;4;Kuldeep to Smith, FOUR runs slow, outside off, and he has smacked this through the cover-point fence. Bad ball, but a superb shot, with entire time on his hands;

36.2;4;Saini to Carey, FOUR runs short, and he guides this over the 'keeper down to the third man fence!;
36.1;4;Saini to Carey, FOUR runs top shot! Full ball, and he drives this like a bullet through extra cover. Holds the pose for the shutterbugs;
35.6;1;Kuldeep to Carey, 1 run sweeps from outside off towards long leg to retain strike;
35.5;4;Kuldeep to Carey, FOUR runs that's a good shot! This is closer to him, and he whips this through mid-wicket. It went on with the angle from over the wicket, and he flogged it over the man at the short mid-wicket fence;
35.4;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run wrong 'un again, and he shuffles across to fetch it from outside off towards long leg;
35.3;?;Kuldeep to Smith, no run wrong 'un, zips past the outside edge. Smith doesn't pick this off the hands;
35.2;?;Kuldeep to Smith, no run length, turns back in from outside off. Strikes him on the pad, but impact would have been outside off, as he misses it;

34.5;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run full, and he drives this back to Bumrah;

34.3;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run length, driven back towards the bowler;
34.2;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run fuller, up to him around middle and leg, and he defends;
34.1;1;Bumrah to Smith, 1 run short, and played down to third man;
33.6;?;Jadeja to Carey, no run looks for the reverse sweep again. Misses on contact, with a ball fired outside off (effectively leg). Jadeja wants a caught-behind in his favour. Not given, and India also refuse to refer this;
33.5;4;Jadeja to Carey, FOUR runs reverse sweep, fetched from well outside what would have been off, and played square of the wicket. Incredible! Jadeja holds the length back, but Carey adjusts well to meet it early, keeping it in front of square;
33.4;?;Jadeja to Carey, no run sweeps straight to short fine leg again;
33.3;?;Jadeja to Carey, no run reverse sweep tried, but straight towards short third man;

32.4;1;Bumrah to Carey, 1 run length, and he cuts this hard, but straight to point. A direct hit at the non-striker's end, and that allows a single. Kohli won't be happy with this...;
32.3;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run length, and he runs this towards point;
32.2;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run length ball, presses forward to defend back towards the bowler;
32.1;1lb;Bumrah to Smith, 1 leg bye length, he shuffles across to the off side and gets struck on the pads in trying to flick. Bumrah wanted to appeal this vociferously, but the line and height might have gone against him;
31.6;W;Jadeja to Starc, OUT two wickets in the over, but a not-so-huge loss for Australia! Jadeja pulls the length back a touch, and also slows it down. Starc looks to slog across the line, but gets it quite high on the bad, and substitute Chahal down by the deep mid-wicket fence has to move across to his left to accept this gleefully!;Mitchell Starc c sub (YS Chahal) b Jadeja 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
31.5;?;Jadeja to Starc, no run slogs across the line. Inside edge towards fine leg;
31.4;?;Jadeja to Starc, no run length, and he drives this towards cover. Fielder is deep and can stop this;
31.3;W;Jadeja to Labuschagne, OUT what a grab this time! Jadeja has tossed this up a touch, and Labuschagne plays another whippy inside out drive. Cannot keep it down, and Kohli dives low to his right and plucks this inches off the grass. Makes it look effortless, but that was a fabulous effort! Big wicket, but it might not be the worst thing for Australia to have some fresh legs and some big hitting out in the middle now;Marnus Labuschagne c Kohli b Jadeja 54 (64b 5x4 0x6) SR: 84.37;
31.2;?;Jadeja to Labuschagne, no run length, driven towards cover, where Kohli fields;
31.1;?;Jadeja to Labuschagne, no run length, around off, and he plays a rasping whipped drive inside out. Dives to his left, does Kohli, to cut this off!;

30.5;4;Shami to Labuschagne, FOUR runs whips a length ball towards deep mid-wicket to bring up a gorgeous half-century! Hasn't had to slog anything. Just batted normally and brought up his first 50 in ODI cricket;
30.4;1;Shami to Smith, 1 run length, and he picks it up from off towards deep square leg, with a characteristic whip off his pads;
30.3;1;Shami to Labuschagne, 1 run shortish, and he whips it away towards fine leg;

28.6;1;Shami to Smith, 1 run takes the pace of the ball, Smith just helps it to third man again;
28.5;1;Shami to Labuschagne, 1 run a bit of a slog there from Labuschagne. Didn't really time it, and it trickles down to the fielder and cow corner. The singles still keep coming, though;
28.4;1;Shami to Smith, 1 run runs it down to third man;
28.3;?;Shami to Smith, no run stayed low on Smith just as he looked to swivel and pull it away. Thick inside edge onto his pad.;

26.2;4lb;Kuldeep to Smith, 4 leg byes down the track, and Smith has an almighty heave. He got nowhere close to it with the bat. The ball spins into his pad and runs down to third man for four. Fortuitous;
26.1;1;Kuldeep to Labuschagne, 1 run nice flight again, eased to mid-off;
25.6;?;Jadeja to Smith, no run defended;
25.5;1;Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run wristy flick. Thought about two, but thought better of it;
25.4;?;Jadeja to Labuschagne, no run blocked;
25.3;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run driven to long-on. They're rotating the strike pretty effectively;
25.2;1;Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run kept low, but Labuschagne manages to get it away to the same fielder.;
25.1;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run cut away to deep point;
24.6;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run wrong'un, but Smith was waiting for it. Uses the pace to work it to third man. Six from the over;
24.5;1;Kuldeep to Labuschagne, 1 run eased down to square leg;
24.4;2;Kuldeep to Labuschagne, 2 runs pick up sweep shot - looked a bit risky but he got good connection on it. A little fumble on the boundary allows them to come back;
24.3;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run a tad full. Smith gets an easy single down the ground;
24.2;1;Kuldeep to Labuschagne, 1 run and again, slightly uppish as he drives to long-off. You sense the wrong'un coming any moment;

23.5;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run turn from middle and off, Smith works it to the offside;
23.4;1;Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run nearly another run-out. Ends up needing the dive to be safe. The umpires have gone up just in case. It's not out;
23.3;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run driven to long-off;
23.2;?;Jadeja to Smith, no run defended to extra cover;
23.1;4;Jadeja to Smith, FOUR runs plays it exceptionally late - this is genius. Almost takes it out of the keeper's hands, and just uses the pace to beat the in-fielder. The outfield ensured no one was stopping that;
22.6;?;Saini to Labuschagne, no run driven back. 9 from that over;
22.5;?;Saini to Labuschagne, no run looked to work it away to the cover region, beaten by the extra pace;
22.4;4;Saini to Labuschagne, FOUR runs feathers it away to fine leg. This is a good over for Australia. Saini wavers slightly with his line, full on middle and leg, and all Labuschagne needs to do is tickle it away for four;
22.3;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run helped to third man again, this thick edge was certainly deliberate. The man in the deep cuts it off though;
22.2;?;Saini to Smith, no run defended to third man;
22.1;4;Saini to Smith, FOUR runs brings up the half-century. Full on off stump, and Smith gets a thick outside edge - possibly deliberate - that is too fine for third man to cut off;

49.6;1;Shami to Agar, 1 run superb from Shami. Finishes with another yorker, and Australia can only manage to get one off the final delivery. Superb final 10 overs from India. Only 63 runs conceded, and India need 287 to win the game, and the series.;

47.4;W;Shami to Cummins, OUT and he's accounted for Cummins first ball again. Just the same way as in Rajkot. The yorker is simply too good for Cummins to get any bat on. It goes underneath and castles him first ball.;Pat Cummins b Mohammed Shami 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

45.6;2;Saini to Smith, 2 runs worked away to cow corner, and placed it nicely enough he was able to come back for 2. 16 off the over. Australia need at least a couple more like that;

45.4;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run gets a single to the offside. 13 off the first four. Can Agar support Smith here in making this a gigantic over?;
45.3;6;Saini to Smith, SIX runs what an absolutely nonsensical shot that is. Absolutely ridiculous. Just outside off, and SMith moves across, and simply wrists it in the air over deep square leg. Sails away for six. That was all wrist.;
45.2;2;Saini to Smith, 2 runs runs this to the right of third man and calls "two" straightaway. Good start from Australia, can they make this a big over?;

India have reviewed for a caught behind! The UltraEdge shows a spike when the ball touches the bat. He's gone! Smart review by Kohli; the wicket came from nowhere;Ashton Turner c ?Rahul b Saini 4 (10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40;
43.5;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run nice timing, and what's happened now? Smith ran through for a single, and Ashton Turner wasn't even looking at him. A throw at the keeper's end would have produced a wicket;

43.3;1;Saini to Smith, 1 run there it is. Runs it down to third man and brings up his ninth ODI hundred, and third against India. It's been a commanding knock. Not much of a celebration. Knows there's more work to be done;

42.4;?;Bumrah to Turner, no run back of a length, pushed to the covers. No run in this over so far;

41.4;W;Kuldeep to Carey, OUT played with the turn, and the wicket finally comes!. Lofted it over cover, and looked a pretty good shot, in all fairness.

22.5;?;Saini to Labuschagne, no run looked to work it away to the cover region, beaten by the extra pace;

22.2;?;Saini to Smith, no run defended to third man;
22.1;4;Saini to Smith, FOUR runs brings up the half-century. Full on off stump, and Smith gets a thick outside edge - possibly deliberate - that is too fine for third man to cut off;

 Innings Start
Not long to go for the weekend's most awaited football fixture as high-flying Liverpool host Manchester United -- the latter without their talisman Marcus Rashford in the line-up. You can follow live updates right here. This is Debayan Sen, saying goodbye on behalf of Thilak Gowda, Danyal Rasool and the rest of our gang at ESPNcricinfo.
9.36pm Virat Kohli goes along and places the series trophy alongside the individual awards as the team poses for pictures with the banner proclaiming them as champions. It's been a lot of fun getting you these games, and we hope you have enjoyed yourself too.
Pete: "All credit to India for the way they approached this match. A total of 286 is normally a very defendable score but India were able to blunt what is arguably one of the best front-line fast bowling attacks in world cricket tonight. That was the difference between the teams tonight - Agar and Zampa bowled beautifully and did all that could be asked of them. Great series in my opinion although not the result I hoped for! "
Virat Kohli is the Man of the Series. Says: "We are quite experienced players, and we were one short in Shikhar today. We got a very good start, and when KL got out, it was a tricky situation because the ball was turning and gripping. We had to play deep, and this is how we have played in the last 4-5 years. This is what experience helps. It's quite enjoyable batting with Rohit, but more importantly, a comprehensive win. (On his cover drive against Starc that went for four) You do practise a lot in the nets. If you are not worried about the short ball, you look to get forward all the time. When I have that clarity in my mind, I just look to get forward. Clarity of mind is the key thing. You need to have a free mind, and today I felt like that. Today I went for my shots. (Satisfying win) Even better than last time. There's Steven, David and Marnus. After 2-0, we lost the last series. We won this after going one down. 2020 has been wonderful, and we just want to go onwards and upwards. Great for the team."
Rohit Sharma is the Man of the Match. Tells Sanjay Manjrekar: "It was an important game, the decider, and we wanted to come out and enjoy ourselves. To keep that Australian batting under 290 was a great effort. Once KL got out, it needed nobody better than the captain himself. The talk we had in the middle was that one of us wanted to keep going. At no stage, did we want the momentum to go towards the opposition, I was middling the ball well, and I said I would be the one to take the chances. Days like this, if it comes off, it looks good. If we had lost a wicket in the middle, it would have been different. (Bowling attack faced) Australia always comes up with a good bowling attack. Their fast bowlers always challenge you with their variety and skills. The first two games, I was trying to do something different, and it didn't come off. Today I just wanted to be there, and I was able to stay till 35th, 36th over."
Aaron Finch: "(The score) The wicket started to turn, and maybe it started to slide a bit more later on. We felt if we were able to post 300 or 310, that would have brought our spinners into play. We probably lost just one wicket (too many). Just that momentum kept getting stalled every now and then. To play against the best in the world in these conditions is a great learning experience. (On the spinners) I think the big difference was the line (Agar) bowled and the length. If the batsman makes a mistake, you are out. Everyone played well. It was a great series to be a part of. (On bringing on part-timers) You play world-class players up front, you will go for a few runs. We wanted to get some wickets up front. It wasn't to be."
9.23pm Right, just about ready in Bengaluru for the match presentation and the series awards to be given away.
Karthik Gopalan: "Man of the series - why not Bumrah? He was the buzzsaw that manufactured wickets for others!" --- Wouldn't mind it going to a bowler at all, personally. I don't think we see enough of those.
Manikandan: "@Debayan i certainly hope that you missed Bumrah's name by accident . It was because of his bowling and the pressure that he created , other bowlers were able to take the wickets.. it was truly unlucky that he went wicketless in today's match " --- I did say India's seamers. That would mean Bumrah too, surely?
90sCricket: "No single player has performed consistently this series. It will be difficult to pick a man of the series. Who would it be? KL?" --- Steven Smith could lay a claim on it, couldn't he?
Karl: "Was on the wall 30 overs ago, or even at the end of Aus innings which inevitably failed to launch in the last 10 overs. Silver lining (from Aus perspective): can we now include Maxwell, and - given BBL form - Stoinis? Having Smith, Labuschagne and Carey means too much middle-order accumulation and then the two Ashtons - where's the hitting power?" --- Yes, in fact, there was a symbolic handing over of the momentum when Aaron Finch handed the 21st over to Marnus Labuschagne. Aaron Finch probably blinked a little early.
Shreyas Iyer: "I have seen them bowling and coming and playing against them - of the matches I have played thus far, they are the best bowling attack. The performance came at the right time. I wanted to stay till the end, because I knew they were going to attack me on my body. (On his chat with Kohli) They were trying to get on my head. They wanted me to go over the top. I really said to myself that I am going to have a good communication with Virat. He told me to take as many singles as possible to start off. I know I can hit the ball when I get my eyes in."
Ravi Shastri speaks to the broadcasters: "This team, the boys showed great character. Nobody can say we played an inferior Australia side. They got a thrashing in Mumbai, and then to win two games, with all the travel, and with Australia winning all three tosses. We picked important wickets in the middle overs. They realised once they got off to a start, that this Australian attack will always look for wickets. Each of those 11 will always look to get in the door if they get a foot in. Virat and Rohit batted well, and Shreyas will get a lot of confidence from this innings. If sides are looking to take us apart in the last 10 overs, then we have a lot of variety. The game might be 130 years old, but that [the yorker] is still the best ball in the world. The exposure they [youngsters] get against this Australian outfit will stand them in good stead. Their mindset will be entirely different. Young Saini is quick, and if he gets it right, he'll tickle a few. Really proud of the guys - I thought they were magnificent."
9.05pm Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will earn a lot of plaudits for their clean striking when India began their chase, but this match was won by India's seamers right at the start. Particularly, Mohammed Shami, who made inroads with the new ball and then came back late to snuff out all hopes Australia had of getting to a 300-plus total.With Shikhar Dhawan injured when India were in the field, India were effectively a specialist batsman short, and that made the start crucial. Rohit and KL Rahul gave them a brisk beginning, and then Kohli walked in at 3 and played another well-controlled innings. Shades of exactly how Australia won the opening match in Mumbai. Also, shades of that successful chase by Australia in 2001, that was engineered by Michael Bevan, the great chase-master of his generation!

35.5;2;Cummins to Kohli, 2 runs wide of off, and he deserved to go for four, there. He has Starc's dive at deep point for keeping it down to two;

41.1;1w;Starc to Kohli, 1 wide length, he walks across and looks to flick this. Goes down leg side, and it has been called a wide. Australia choose to review this, but they are told they don't have enough time for this. Seemed to sound like thigh pad, or perhaps even the bat. Looks like thigh pad;

31.3;6;Hazlewood to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs what a way to bring up the hundred partnership. Just leans into an on-drive and it sails away over long-on for six. Smashing Hazlewood hasn't been easy but it looks no trouble for Rohit;

3.2;4;Starc to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs width, across him, and he lays his bat it again. Well placed, as he gets it to the left of point. Just a stand-and-deliver drive!;
3.1;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run length, straightens in from middle, and he plays it with the inward movement wide of mid-on;
2.6;1;Cummins to Rahul, 1 run shorter length, off the inside edge and on to pad. Goes towards point and they pinch a single;
2.5;4;Cummins to Rahul, FOUR runs terrific drive! Presses a bit forward, transfers his weight, and eases into a cover drive to one fractionally fuller;
2.4;?;Cummins to Rahul, no run back of a length, shapes back in from outside off, and he defends;
2.4;5w;Cummins to Rahul, 5 wide way down leg side, and Carey cannot collect. Big swing after pitching down leg stump, and moving further away;
2.3;?;Cummins to Rahul, no run length, nips back in, and he defends towards point;
2.2;?;Cummins to Rahul, no run short, angles in, and he defends this towards point;
2.1;?;Cummins to Rahul, no run short, just outside off, and he lets it pass. Bowled at a good pace, and he knows better than to fiddle with it;

Vikram Kunjappa: "#bengaluruboys would love to see Rahul or Manish to finish the match since it's their homeground." --- A 'career-defining' knock for Pandey then?
