Excellent effort from Pakistan, and they owe it to Afridi - he leads the team off the field - and Ajmal for restricting Australia to a paltry score. Australia started well, particularly with Haddin and Watson getting them to a strong position, but once spin was introduced into the attack, they collapsed. They lost eight wickets for 27 in around 11 overs as the spin duo flummoxed the batsmen with their variations - Ajmal with the doosra, and Afridi with the googly. Though the last pair frustrated them, adding 46, Pakistan will back themselves to win this, though we can expect the Australians to use Clarke and Symonds for more overs than they usually do, along with Hauritz. Join us in about ten minutes for the run-chase.

2.57 pm: The crowd's built up. Huge cheers for the 'home team' as they walk out. The Australian openers follow. Marsh will face, Gul will start proceedings for Pakistan. All set! Two slips in place.
2.41 pm: The pitch looks very favourable for batting, but it hasn't been used often. Batting first, the experts believe, was the right decision. It's hot, the pitch is flat, and the bowlers may have to toil hard.
Australia: Michael Clarke (capt), Brad Haddin (wk), Shaun Marsh, Andrew Symonds, Callum Ferguson, Shane Watson, James Hopes, Nathan Hauritz, Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clark, Ben Hilfenhaus
Pakistan: Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan (capt), Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib MAlik, Kamran Akmal (wk), Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Akhtar, Umar Gul, Rao Iftikhar Anjum, Saeed Ajmal
2.30 pm: Time for the toss. Australia have won the toss and opted to bat. Shaun Marsh, Shane Watson, Stuart Clark, Andrew Symonds and Ben Hilfenhaus are all in. Younis Khan says he would have batted first had he won, and says a score of around 260-odd would be chaseable. Shoaib Akhtar is back! We'll get you the XI's in a bit.
2.25 pm: We're still waiting for the toss, hold fire. Wow, the venue looks neat. They're playing at the Dubai Sports City, and the stands are covered in a wave of blue seats. The capacity is around 25,000, though there just seem to be around a few hundred spectators at this point. But it's Pakistan playing, so it should build as the game progresses.
Faras: "I'm a Pakistani fan but I don't feel let down by playing a 'weakened' Australian side. I think this has taken us back to early 2007 when we played Zimbabwe and Bangladesh and the country was happy that we were playing cricket despite it being against a weaker opposition. It also gives our players a chance to climb up the ratings."
A slight element of complacency there, this Australian side is much stronger than one would think, and as Pakistan haven't played in some time, it brings both teams, despite the latter being stronger on paper, on fairly even terms.
Ari: "I am an Aussie fan and I think it is great they made this tour work for the sake of Pakistan cricket but isn't it a slight let down that some of our best players are being rested? I agree the Ashes are a priority this year but if I was a Pakistan player I would feel slightly let down."
2.00 pm: Our Pakistan Editor Osman Samiuddin gives us the series preview. They're showing some footage from the X-games on TV, some slick acrobatic moves, but the coverage should start soon.
1.55 pm: We'll get you the details from the toss shortly, but do read the preview to the game in the meantime.
1.50 pm local time: Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the first ODI between Pakistan and Australia being played in Dubai. It's been a difficult few months for Pakistan, with teams refusing to tour the country, the attack on Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore, and most recently, the ICC deciding to strip the country of its right to host the 2011 World Cup.
However, the team won't be short of support at the UAE which is more or less a home away from home. Australia are missing some big names, but they also have Andrew Symonds returning to the side after a fairly long break. They just recently suffered a 2-3 ODI series defeat in South Africa but their win in the final game will give them confidence going into this tour. Shoaib Akhtar finally makes a return after a while; he's managed to recover from a niggling knee injury.
 Innings Start
A morale-boosting win for Pakistan after all that has happened in the recent months. Australia were in control early on, but were dented by a six-wicket burst from Shahid Afridi. Though they did fight back well to make Pakistan work for their runs, a score of 168 never looked threatening. Kamran Akmal was the star with the bat, making a fluent 48, and Afridi provided some entertainment with a quickfire 24. Misbah laboured to 30, but his presence at the crease was important for Pakistan to scale down their target.
Australia will try to bat hard at the nets, facing their spinners and using their feet a lot more to get some much needed practice ahead of their second match. Hold fire, and we'll bring you the details from the presentation shortly.
There are a zillion people on the presentation podium. Shahid Afridi is the Man of the Match. No surprises there.
Afridi: "I'm very happy to perform this well against a very good side. I learnt a lot from Abdul Qadir." Short and sweet.
Clarke: "Full credit to Pakistan. Our middle-order needs to work more, especially against spin. The pitch kept a little low and spun. We need to have a look at the footage and improve upon our batting come Friday."
Younis: "The Australians made it hard for us, but in the end it's a team effort. Our spinners did the job for us. In the UAE, the pitch does help the spinners a bit. Shahid Afridi and Saeed Ajmal bowled really well."
That's all we have from here folks. Thanks for tuning in and sending us your feedback. Join us again on Friday for the second ODI. Until then, on behalf of everyone at Cricinfo, it's goodbye from Siddhartha Talya. Cheers!
