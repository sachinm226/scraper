Tendulkar was late in moving and couldn't quite get down in time. I dare say Rahul Dravid might have caught it !;

Good start from Australia, considering the ball was moving around. They have lost just one wicket
 Innings Start
Both teams shake hands and they wait for the post-match ceremony. Hang on for a short while, we would bring you the breathless quotes from that. Hopefully, we would know why Brett Lee wasn't used in the end. Was he injured? He was there on the field, though. Let's see if they ask Ricky the question.
Dhoni: "What we wanted to do was to take the game till the end. Five overs of powerplay was left and we should have achieved it but ... Thanks to Harbhajan and Praveen who made it such an interesting game. I would have been with a 270 score [When Australia batted]. We need to improve the death bowling and batsmen to carry on to make big scores."
Ponting: "It was a pretty good performance other than six or seven overs in the end. The wicket held up nicely and the outfield was fast. We were just good enough to hold out in the end. The top order did a good job today; unfortunately we couldn't get on to score a hundred. TOld Siddle to be just calm and have one thought .. just keep it simple. Harbhajan played well in the end."
Hussey is the Man of the Match: "It was good fun. I really enjoyed the partnership with White in particular and the assault in the end came good. We had good partnerships higher up the order ... Paine and Ponting. It was important to have wickets for the end. There was no target set; we tried to get to 300. The outfield is small is some places and very very fast; it's a difficult ground to defend. The series should be very entertaining to the crowds."
That's it from us. Thanks for logging on. Apologies for the mess created by server problems during the end overs in the first innings. We do hope you would join us for the second game.Till then, Good bye and Good luck.
