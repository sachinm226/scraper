85.3;2;Holder to Voges, 2 runs fullish on middle stump and Voges brings his bat around his front pad to flick it away to the left of long leg. He always looks like an lbw candidate with that front leg planted right in front of the stumps;

Khawaja soaks in warm applause from the crowd as he walks back to the dressing room. He's shown a terrific appetite for runs ever since his Test comeback.;Usman Khawaja c ?Ramdin b Taylor 144 (331m 227b 6x4 1x6) SR: 63.43;
131.6;1;Brathwaite to Smith, 1 run fullish on leg stump, swept to deep backward square leg;
131.5;?;Brathwaite to Smith, no run short, down the leg side, Smith can't quite connect with the paddle. Good take down the leg side from Ramdin, particularly given Smith was in front of him, waving his bat all over the place;

83.5;?;Holder to Smith, no run full on off stump, driven to mid-off;
83.4;4;Holder to Smith, FOUR runs short on off stump, and Smith will keep pulling those all day, smashes that to the midwicket boundary with a baseball-style finish;

82.2;?;Taylor to Smith, no run back of a length outside off, pushed towards point;
82.1;1;Taylor to Khawaja, 1 run short, wide, and it nearly produces a wicket, but Samuels has dropped a dolly. Khawaja was early into his slash, and he hit it in the air, straight to cover, at midriff height. For some reason, he went for it with fingers pointing up, and the ball didn't stick;
81.6;?;Holder to Smith, no run ends it with a length ball in the corridor, and Smith ignores it;
81.5;4;Holder to Smith, FOUR runs and now a short ball, pulled away contemptuously to the midwicket boundary;
81.4;?;Holder to Smith, no run length ball on off stump, defended into the covers. No footwork again, no front-foot movement, just sort of walks into the shot and opens out;
81.4;2nb;Holder to Khawaja, (no ball) 1 run and now he bowls one on the pads, easy pickings, clipped down to long leg;
81.3;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run much better. Lovely length, attacking off stump, and Khawaja is opened up again, no footwork in defence, and he squirts it away towards point;
81.2;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run once again, an easy leave. He's angling it away from Khawaja, and starting it well outside off stump;

78.2;?;Brathwaite to Smith, no run length ball, fourth-stump line, defended towards point;

75.2;1;Brathwaite to Khawaja, 1 run length ball on middle stump, tucked away through midwicket;

74.5;?;Brathwaite to Khawaja, no run back of a length outside off, chopped down to the squarer of two gullies;
74.4;3;Brathwaite to Smith, 3 runs short and wide, he has to reach for it a bit, but times that back-foot slap well and picks up three by the time it slows down near the cover point boundary. Brathwaite and Warrican both go chasing, they're in a foot race, and there's a bit of confusion over which of them should pick up and throw;
74.3;?;Brathwaite to Smith, no run full outside off, and Smith plays his trademark fly-swatter leave;
74.2;1;Brathwaite to Khawaja, 1 run fullish outside off. Goes for the cover drive, doesn't quite get his weight fully onto the front foot, and the angle causes him to inside-edge through the leg side;

73.3;1;Brathwaite to Smith, 1 run and as expected, he's down the track first ball to drive the middle-stump ball down to long-on;
73.2;W;Brathwaite to Burns, OUT got him! Classic offie's dismissal! Burns skips down the pitch but Brathwaite sees him coming and fires it a bit quicker and shorter outside off. It doesn't turn, it slips past the edge of his prodding bat, and Ramdin has the bails off in a flash. Big ovation for Burns as he walks back, this has been a very impressive innings, especially the discipline outside off stump until he reached his hundred;Joe Burns st ?Ramdin b KC Brathwaite 128 (309m 230b 16x4 1x6) SR: 55.65;

71.5;4;Warrican to Burns, FOUR runs down the track again, and he skips inside the line of this flighted ball to loft it inside-out over the covers, far enough to the right of sweeper cover and the left of long-off to pick up four;

71.3;2;Warrican to Burns, 2 runs once again down the track, this one doesn't turn, and he swipes with the angle towards wide long-on;

57.1;3;Warrican to Burns, 3 runs shortish, close to off stump, and Burns makes a little bit of room and punches it away through point to pick up three and reach his second Test hundred. He's overjoyed, and breaks into an entirely un-rehearsed celebration, broad grin, bat waving all over the place;
56.6;?;Taylor to Khawaja, no run length ball on off stump, and he whips it to midwicket. Burns starts running for his partner's 100th, and he's sent back. The throw comes in at the fielder's end, and nearly gives away overthrows as well;

54.3;4;Taylor to Khawaja, FOUR runs short again, width again, and again he waits on the ball to play it late and find that third man boundary. They have a fielder at deep point, but he'll remain a spectator if he keeps playing this shot so late;
54.2;4;Taylor to Khawaja, FOUR runs short and wide, and that's very well played. Has so much time to let it come on and steer it away to the third man boundary;

 Innings Start
Dev: "The last 4 Windies batsmen played positively and no pressure or whatsoever, have put some runs on the board. Something that the rest of their batsmen should take a cue from and try doing it in second innings. At least fight it out to take this game to the 5th day. Yes, I am a die-hard Windies fan."
3.12pm We have confirmation that Australia will bat again. We might see a few changes in their batting order.
3:08pm: Lyon leads Australia off the field. Four each for him and Pattinson, and they've definitely been the picks of Australia's bowling. Lyon has prospered with flight and drift and no real help from the pitch, while Pattinson set the tone yesterday by attacking the stumps and reversing it menacingly. End of a good innings from Bravo. A couple more of the top-order batsmen showing that kind of discipline and focus could have meant a far bigger West Indies total. As it is, they've finished 81 short of saving the follow-on, though I don't think Australia are enforcing it.

55.6;?;Lyon to Bravo, no run flight and drift into the left-hander, continues on along that course after pitching to beat the inside edge of his defensive push and hit his front pad, but that was easily sliding down leg. Not much of an appeal from the Aussies;
55.5;1;Lyon to Brathwaite, 1 run back of a length, turning into off stump, goes deep in his crease and pushes towards cover point;
55.4;?;Lyon to Brathwaite, no run flighted and full outside off. Brathwaite is a little slow getting forward and ends up inside-edging towards short leg while looking to defend into the off side;

53.1;?;Lyon to Brathwaite, no run wide outside off but not short enough to cut, hurries through to beat Brathwaite's top edge. Nevill rises to his toes to collect, and whips off the bails, and they're going up to the third umpire even though he was on the back foot. Did he lift it inadvertently? He did, but was that before or after the bails came off? I think Nevill could have waited just a bit longer there. Not out.;

Here's another Nathan... Lyon.
Nathan: "Couldn't agree more Craig. Test cricket to survive needs the WI, Pakistan and all nations healthy or it can't survive in these days of franchise cricket. And here's a thought, if the ICC want to GROW the game, they must include the Associates to a greater degree rather than chase the money. If they continue to do that, only 3 countries will survive and the game will be lost for good."
Nathan: "Further .... when I grew up I feared the WI, marvelled at Sunny Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, loathed the English, silently cheered for the Sri Lankans and Pakistanis (especially in the WC final against the Poms), called Hadlee a "*&#$@^" and prayed I would see South Africa play again in my lifetime. Now I fear for the game itself !!"

8.5;?;Brathwaite to Khawaja, no run full, angling too far down leg, Ramdin tumbles to his right to collect it low;
8.4;?;Brathwaite to Khawaja, no run length ball on off stump, clipped to midwicket;
8.3;?;Brathwaite to Khawaja, no run length ball outside off, presses forward to block into the covers;
8.2;1lb;Brathwaite to Warner, 1 leg bye shortish, at the body, Warner looks to pull and misses, it rolls into the leg side off his upraised front thigh;
8.1;?;Brathwaite to Warner, no run short outside off and Warner doesn't get hold of the pull. A bit uppish, but it bounces short of mid-on;
7.6;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run this one's angled into off stump and he jumps across to whip to midwicket;
7.5;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run lovely, back of a length, angling in, jagging away off the seam, and Khawaja plays and misses a fair way away from his body;
7.4;1;Holder to Warner, 1 run back of a length outside off, jabbed away with an angled bat through point. Loads of singles on offer with point on the boundary;
7.3;1;Holder to Khawaja, 1 run back of a length, angling too far into the batsman, worked off the hips to long leg;
7.2;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run length ball angling into off stump, stays on the back foot and pushes to mid-on;
7.1;1;Holder to Warner, 1 run full, angling into off stump, brings his bat down at an angle to poke that towards midwicket;
6.6;?;Brathwaite to Khawaja, no run short, too close to off stump to cut. Khawaja rises to his toes and chops it down into the ground;
6.5;1;Brathwaite to Warner, 1 run back of a length, angling into off stump, nudged off the hips through backward square leg;
6.4;1;Brathwaite to Khawaja, 1 run back of a length outside off, shuffles across to work it through midwicket;
6.3;1;Brathwaite to Warner, 1 run back of a length outside off, Warner waits on it and steers to deep point;
6.2;?;Brathwaite to Warner, no run short, doesn't quite come on as Warner is early into his pull. The ball hits him on the left bicep and bounces up into the off side;
6.1;4;Brathwaite to Warner, FOUR runs short and wide, and Warner waits on it, leans back, and cuts it away deftly to the third man boundary. Lovely use of hands and wrists;
5.6;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run length ball close to off stump. Shuffles across rather than move forward, and he squeezes the defensive poke out to backward point as the ball straightens a bit;
5.5;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run back of a length, fourth-stump line, jumps across to tuck it to midwicket;
5.4;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run back of a length, angling into off stump, blocked back down the ground. Was looking for a single, but had to turn around as the ball rolled off Warner's foot towards the mid-off fielder;
5.3;2;Holder to Khawaja, 2 runs length ball angling into off stump, straightens just a touch as Khawaja shuffles across. Ends up slicing it towards third man off the outer half of the bat;
5.2;2;Holder to Khawaja, 2 runs back of a length on middle and off, shuffles across to tuck it away through square leg;
5.1;1;Holder to Warner, 1 run back of a length outside off, dabbed away quietly backward of point;
4.6;?;Taylor to Khawaja, no run back of a length, fourth-stump line, defended off the back foot into the off side;
4.5;4;Taylor to Khawaja, FOUR runs shot! That's just a touch short, not too much width, but he just stands tall and puts it away, using his wrists at the top of the bounce to flay it behind point;
4.4;2;Taylor to Khawaja, 2 runs back of a length on middle and leg, shuffles across to tuck it away towards fine leg;
4.3;4;Taylor to Khawaja, FOUR runs short again and Khawaja punishes it, he's an excellent puller, steps across and whips it away off his hips;
4.2;1;Taylor to Warner, 1 run short, pulled from outside off towards deep square leg;
4.1;2;Taylor to Warner, 2 runs full, angling away from off stump, driven firmly to mid-off, where Roach fumbles to allow a second run;
3.6;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run length ball close to off stump, blocked back to the bowler;
3.5;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run back of a length in the corridor, this time it's a little shorter, and Khawaja leaves comfortably;
3.4;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run back of a length along the same angle, defended into the covers;
3.3;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run fuller now, nice line in the corridor. Khawaja's feet aren't moving yet, and he pokes that defensive shot into the covers with his hands doing most of the work. His feet move after he makes contact;
3.2;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run back of a length, slanting away from Khawaja, who's opened up and beaten as he jumps across to defend;
3.1;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run back of a length outside off, left alone;
2.6;1;Taylor to Khawaja, 1 run length ball angling into the pads, clipped away towards long leg;
2.5;?;Taylor to Khawaja, no run full outside off and that's driven crisply down the ground but Roach stops it well, diving left from mid-off;
2.4;4;Taylor to Khawaja, FOUR runs short outside off, Khawaja has ample time to get across and swivel on his back heel to pull to the midiwcket boundary;
2.3;?;Taylor to Khawaja, no run back of a length close to off stump, goes back and across and tucks it around to midwicket;
2.2;?;Taylor to Khawaja, no run back of a length, fourth-stump line, defended towards mid-off;
2.1;1;Taylor to Warner, 1 run back of a length close to off stump, Warner plays a controlled punch to deep point;
1.6;?;Holder to Khawaja, no run greets him with a bouncer and he ducks awkwardly into it, eyes off the ball. It pops up off his back, balloons to the right of the keeper;
1.5;W;Holder to Burns, OUT got him! This one curls away from a lovely fullish length wide of off stump. Burns is in the mood to play his shots, but his feet go nowhere, his hands go chasing wide of his body, and the nick carries nicely to second slip;Joe Burns c Brathwaite b Holder 5 (10m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
1.4;?;Holder to Burns, no run back of a length on middle and off, defended to midwicket;
1.3;?;Holder to Burns, no run;
1.2;?;Holder to Burns, no run appeal for lbw as Burns pushes half-forward to defend. This one nipped back in, hit the front pad, and then the back pad. No inside edge. Hit him in line with off stump, and that might well have hit the stumps. Tracking says clipping, and therefore umpire's call;
1.1;1;Holder to Warner, 1 run back of a length, angling into the body, hops up and tucks it away to deep square leg;
0.6;?;Taylor to Burns, no run length ball on middle stump, defended towards midwicket;
0.5;1;Taylor to Warner, 1 run full outside off, driven to mid-off, who's deep enough to permit the quick single;
0.4;1;Taylor to Burns, 1 run back of a length, angling down leg, Burns can't put bat on his leg glance, runs off his hip into the leg side;
0.3;?;Taylor to Burns, no run back of a length, a bit of shape away, Burns defends towards gully;
0.2;?;Taylor to Burns, no run this one swings into Burns from a good length, and he's struck on the pad while shouldering arms. Not given out, and West Indies decide not to review. Struck him on the back thigh, so I guess it would have sailed over the stumps;
0.1;4;Taylor to Burns, FOUR runs full, wide outswinger first up. Burns chases away from his body, slices it in the air, just wide of gully diving to his right;

3.26pm We're all set to resume. Jerome Taylor has the new ball, and Australia's usual opening pair of Warner and Burns is at the crease.
 Innings Start
6.10pm That's all from us from this Boxing Day Test. Hope you've enjoyed it. Keep tuning in to our coverage, keep sending in your comments, and have an awesome New Year. I'll leave you with a few of your comments. Until next time, goodbye!
Mal: "I'm very pleased with what I saw from both teams today. WI showed encouraging fight and determination, and almost held their own today. Australia, despite missing so many fast bowlers due to retirement or injury, chiselled them out."
AJ: "Among all this, I just cant believe how selfless Smith is. HE could have easily made another ton to his credit but it takes much much than what we think to declare like this and look at teams cause. Great captain in the making.."
Old Buzzard: "So now we have a Mitchell Pheiffer!" -- Well, not quite, but I'll include your comment for wit anyway.
Nathan Lyon is the Man of the Match. "I'm trying to improve each day," he says. "That was a great Test match, credit to our bowlers. We stuck there and got the late reward. Definitely [work at catching off my own bowling]. Obviously helps if you can hold on to your catches. Can't wait to get down to the dressing room and celebrate with the boys. Credit to the West Indies to push us all the way to the end of day four, made us work really hard."
Steven Smith: We made it difficult for ourselves, overstepping, we had to take 23 wickets, not 20. I thought Mitchell Marsh was impressive today, he really charged in, hit the pitch hard, got it reversing. Usman is playing beautifully. I've put myself down at No. 4 and I think it's a good decision. He's made three hundreds in a row, and another in the Big Bash as well. Lyon is bowling extremely well at the moment and is taking crucial wickets. Hopefully he can continue doing that for a long time. You want to try and wrap up the series 3-0. The West Indies fought really well and I'm sure they'll come back hard at Sydney as well.
Jason Holder: I thought most of the guys applied themselves, which was really commendable. Credit to the way Australia played, they outplayed us. We had to keep wickets in hand, occupy the crease. Our plan was for me and Ramdin to stick on till the end of the day. Carlos came in and showed spirit [in the first innings], and bowled well. We have been criticised from all different angles, but I've just stressed to the team to keep faith. This shows what we can do if we apply ourselves. We just need to keep that belief and keep pushing Australia.
6.02pm Two-nil to Australia, and it was never in doubt. West Indies fought pretty well today, but they will know they could have done so much better. All of their top seven got starts, but only Ramdin and Holder made half-centuries. In any case, the match was lost much, much earlier, when their bowlers let four of the Australian top five make hundreds.
88.3;W;Marsh to Taylor, OUT short on off stump, and Australia have won the Frank Worrell Trophy! Goes for the pull, doesn't get hold of it, it goes high in the air off the top edge and Pattinson moves to his left at long leg and dives to take a well-judged catch at long leg;Jerome Taylor c Pattinson b Marsh 0 (8m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
88.2;?;Marsh to Taylor, no run yorker on off stump, jams down and just about keeps it out;
88.1;?;Marsh to Taylor, no run back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers;
87.6;4;Pattinson to Warrican, FOUR runs boom. Shortish on off stump and he clears his front leg and heaves it over wide mid-on;
87.5;?;Pattinson to Warrican, no run fullish outside off and he chases away from his body, finishing with left elbow high, picture postcard, really, but for the small detail that he hasn't made any contact with the ball;
87.4;?;Pattinson to Warrican, no run length ball outside off, left alone;
87.3;W;Pattinson to Roach, OUT got him, Australia only need one wicket now. Perfectly directed, hits the pitch hard, short of a good length, gets it to rise and straighten on off stump, and Roach is squared up, nicks it off the shoulder of the bat to third slip;Kemar Roach c Warner b Pattinson 11 (38m 25b 2x4 0x6) SR: 44;
87.2;4;Pattinson to Roach, FOUR runs fullish outside off, flat-batted to the left of short cover. That came back into him but he still managed to middle it;
87.1;?;Pattinson to Roach, no run back of a length, fourth-stump line, punched to short extra cover;
86.6;W;Marsh to Holder, OUT got him! That was full on off stump and Holder checked his drive, maybe it held up a bit on the pitch. No feet, and he pushed at it in front of his body, and ended up scooping it straight to mid-off;Jason Holder c Hazlewood b Marsh 68 (136m 86b 7x4 2x6) SR: 79.06;
86.5;1;Marsh to Roach, 1 run full on middle and leg, clipped to long leg;
86.4;?;Marsh to Roach, no run fullish on off stump, stays on the back foot and blocks into the covers;
86.3;1;Marsh to Holder, 1 run and again, that legcutter finds the leading edge as he plays across a middle-stump ball. This one goes in the air into the vacant cover point region;
86.2;?;Marsh to Holder, no run in the blockhole on middle stump, jabbed back to the bowler;
86.1;4;Marsh to Holder, FOUR runs length ball on off and middle, straightens to produce the leading edge as Holder looks to whip across the line, and it flies over the leaping, outstretched Warner at gully;
85.6;?;Pattinson to Roach, no run length ball on middle stump, defended to mid-on;
85.5;1;Pattinson to Holder, 1 run length ball close to off stump, gets on the front foot and pushes gently into the covers;
85.4;?;Pattinson to Holder, no run bouncer, angling down leg, easily ignored;
85.3;?;Pattinson to Holder, no run shortish, close to off stump, left alone;
85.2;1;Pattinson to Roach, 1 run shortish, angling into the body, skips across and tucks it down into the leg side;
85.1;?;Pattinson to Roach, no run back of a length, straightens in the corridor, and Roach's defensive poke is beaten once more;
84.6;?;Hazlewood to Holder, no run length ball curling away outside off, left alone;
84.5;?;Hazlewood to Holder, no run back of a length on off and middle, defended to mid-off;

84.2;?;Hazlewood to Holder, no run length ball close to off stump, straightens and lifts to beat the outside edge;
84.1;?;Hazlewood to Holder, no run full on off stump, driven smoothly down the ground and Warner dives right from mid-off to stop it;
83.6;4;Pattinson to Roach, FOUR runs full on middle stump and Roach shows the full face to drive down the ground, between the non-striker and mid-on. Khawaja, running back from mid-on, couldn't quite pull the ball back short of the rope;
83.5;?;Pattinson to Roach, no run length ball straightens in the corridor to beat Roach's defensive prod;
83.4;1;Pattinson to Holder, 1 run back of a length close to off stump, pushed to the right of Lyon at backward point;
83.3;?;Pattinson to Holder, no run and again, too short, too far down the leg side. Holder simply watches it through to the keeper;
83.2;?;Pattinson to Holder, no run another bouncer, angling a touch too far down leg, Holder ducks;
83.1;4;Pattinson to Holder, FOUR runs bouncer, angling down leg, Holder hooks it away to the fine leg boundary;
82.6;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run back of a length on off stump, jumps back and across to defend into the covers;
82.5;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run full on middle stump, clipped to mid-on;
82.4;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run sharp, rising bouncer over middle stump, and Roach has to duck in a hurry;

82.2;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run full, fourth-stump line, goes on the back foot and blocks into the off side;
82.1;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run another wide outswinger, another leave from Roach;
81.6;?;Pattinson to Holder, no run short outside off and Holder moves away from his leg stump and aims a big slog across the line, makes no contact;
81.5;?;Pattinson to Holder, no run back of a length, hits the pitch hard and hits Holder's thigh as he misses the flick;
81.4;?;Pattinson to Holder, no run length ball wide of off stump, swings away and it's an easy leave for Holder;
81.3;?;Pattinson to Holder, no run back of a length on off stump, defended with soft hands and the ball rolls back towards the slip cordon;
81.2;?;Pattinson to Holder, no run back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-off;
81.1;?;Pattinson to Holder, no run back of a length outside off, and this one keeps low, bounces through a couple of times on its way to the keeper after Holder leaves it;
80.6;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run now he gets his line right, angling into off stump and leaving Roach late. He's beaten again, and opened up, and it didn't miss the top of off by much;
80.5;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run full outside off, swings away, Roach lets it go;
80.4;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run back of a length outside off, swerving away, Roach does that half-beaten, half-leave thing again;
80.3;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run a little wider and Roach ignores it;
80.2;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run back of a length outside off, cries of anguish from the slip cordon as it goes past Roach's edge, but it looked like he was pulling the bat inside the line when he saw it move away from him;
80.1;?;Hazlewood to Roach, no run length ball outside off, still too wide to make Roach play;
80.1;1w;Hazlewood to Roach, 1 wide length ball swinging out of Hazlewood's hand and finishing wide outside off, left alone and called wide;
79.6;1;Lyon to Roach, 1 run full outside off and he gets forward to guide it behind point with an open bat face;
79.5;?;Lyon to Roach, no run length ball turning into off stump, defended off the back foot;
79.4;?;Lyon to Roach, no run length ball turning into middle stump, goes back and tucks it to short leg;
79.3;W;Lyon to Brathwaite, OUT and is that bowled? Beautiful delivery in any case, drifting away as it so often does, causing the batsman to push down the wrong line in defence. Then it turned in and... and it's just nudged the top of the off bail. A wonderful sight in slow-motion, and then it falls forward off its groove;Carlos Brathwaite b Lyon 2 (4m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
79.2;1;Lyon to Holder, 1 run back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to long leg;
79.1;?;Lyon to Holder, no run tossed up on leg stump, gets forward, front pad out of the way, to defend down the pitch;
78.6;?;Marsh to Brathwaite, no run back of a length outside off, punched to short extra cover;
78.5;?;Marsh to Brathwaite, no run short outside off, Brathwaite pulls his bat inside the line to let it go;
78.4;2;Marsh to Brathwaite, 2 runs starts confidently, punching a back-of-a-length ball away through cover point;
78.3;W;Marsh to Ramdin, OUT and that is the breakthrough. Beautiful ball from Marsh, a fullish length but not quite up there for the drive. Right there in the corridor, and it straightens away to take Ramdin's edge as he pushes his bat out a long way in front of his pad, looking for that drive through mid-off;Denesh Ramdin c ?Nevill b Marsh 59 (123m 90b 8x4 0x6) SR: 65.55;
78.2;1;Marsh to Holder, 1 run short ball angling into middle and leg, pulled away through backward square leg;
78.1;?;Marsh to Holder, no run fullish on off stump, driven to short cover;
77.6;?;Lyon to Ramdin, no run tossed up on off stump, presses forward to defend;
77.5;2;Lyon to Ramdin, 2 runs down the track comes Ramdin, and that's a dangerous shot. Long-on is only two-thirds of the way to the rope, so he chances his arm. Doesn't reach the pitch and just about clears Warner as he turns around to chase it;
77.4;?;Lyon to Ramdin, no run back of a length on leg stump, goes back to flick but misses, and it hits his thigh;
77.3;1;Lyon to Holder, 1 run down the track, isn't quite to the pitch of it, ends up swiping the ball away, on the bounce, towards deep midwicket;
77.2;1;Lyon to Ramdin, 1 run full on leg stump, clipped away towards long leg;
77.1;?;Lyon to Ramdin, no run back of a length on middle and off, goes on the back foot to punch to midwicket;
76.6;?;Marsh to Holder, no run short ball outside off, loops tennis-ball style to Nevill after the batsman ignores it;
76.5;2;Marsh to Holder, 2 runs short ball on off stump, pulled away in the air, and Burns, who's standing in a big shadow at deep square leg, is a little late coming in for the catch, and the ball lands a couple of feet short of him;
76.4;?;Marsh to Holder, no run back of a length outside off, left alone;
76.3;1lb;Marsh to Ramdin, 1 leg bye length ball that seems to be sliding down leg on first view, Ramdin misses the flick and it hits the outside of his front pad. Not given, and Smith reviews again. That definitely isn't hitting leg stump, and I haven't seen ball-tracking yet. Here it is - even impact is marginally on leg stump, and the ball is only angling further down;
76.2;?;Marsh to Ramdin, no run short outside off. Ramdin stands tall and punches, bounces a couple of feet short of Khawaja at short extra cover;
76.1;1;Marsh to Holder, 1 run short, angling into the hips, tucked away through forward square leg and Holder reaches his half-century as well;
75.6;1;Lyon to Holder, 1 run tossed up on off stump, driven to long-on;
75.5;1;Lyon to Ramdin, 1 run full outside off, driven down the ground, to the left of mid-on;
75.4;?;Lyon to Ramdin, no run flighted ball outside off and he goes for the sweep, misses. Hits him on the back thigh and Lyon has a loud lbw appeal denied. Australia review. Let's see if that hit him in line first. Did it hit the flap of his pad first, and then the side of his body? I think it did, from the zoomed-in picture. Snicko confirms this. Ian Gould asks for ball tracking, and are we having issues with ball-tracking again? It takes its time but it shows up finally. Impact is outside off, and it's shown to be bouncing over the stumps. Not out.;
75.3;1;Lyon to Holder, 1 run tossed up on off stump, gets forward to clip with the turn to deep midwicket;
75.2;4;Lyon to Holder, FOUR runs super response, skips down the pitch, stays inside the line of the flighted ball outside off and drives inside-out through cover;
75.1;?;Lyon to Holder, no run and again goes past the outside edge with an offbreak. A bit of drift away, Holder misreads the initial line of the ball as he comes half-forward to defend;
74.6;?;Marsh to Ramdin, no run shortish outside off, punched to short cover;
74.5;?;Marsh to Ramdin, no run back of a length outside off, chopped down to short cover;
74.4;2;Marsh to Ramdin, 2 runs back of a length on leg stump, jumps across and tucks it off his hips through square leg;
74.3;?;Marsh to Ramdin, no run full outside off, driven to mid-off;
74.2;?;Marsh to Ramdin, no run length ball outside off, defended to short cover;
74.1;?;Marsh to Ramdin, no run back of a length outside off, left alone;
73.6;1;Smith to Ramdin, 1 run back of a length, angling down leg, tucked away to long leg;
73.5;?;Smith to Ramdin, no run back of a length, turns away from off stump. Ramdin goes back and punches it back to Smith;
73.4;?;Smith to Ramdin, no run loopy full-toss on off stump, punched back to the bowler;
73.3;4;Smith to Ramdin, FOUR runs high full-toss outside off, clubbed away to the midwicket boundary to bring up his half-century;
73.2;?;Smith to Ramdin, no run full on off and middle, Ramdin presses forward to block;
73.1;?;Smith to Ramdin, no run flat, fired down the leg side, not much Ramdin can do about it;
72.6;4;Marsh to Holder, FOUR runs another good short ball, rising shoulder high. Holder swivels to hook, top-edges it and sends it looping over the keeper;
72.5;?;Marsh to Holder, no run length ball on off stump, defended to short extra cover;
72.4;2;Marsh to Holder, 2 runs short outside off, and again he's a little late on the pull, hits it in the air but it lands safely, well beyond midwicket;
72.3;2;Marsh to Holder, 2 runs full and fairly wide, leans over it to play a checked drive into the covers;
72.2;?;Marsh to Holder, no run back of a length close to off stump, defended to gully;
72.1;?;Marsh to Holder, no run short on off stump, slightly late on the pull, plays it down to mid-on;
71.6;?;Siddle to Ramdin, no run slower ball on middle stump, quite full. Clips to mid-on, calls for the single, and is sent back, forcing him to turn around and dive into his crease;
71.5;1;Siddle to Holder, 1 run full on off stump, driven down the ground to the right of mid-off;
71.4;4;Siddle to Holder, FOUR runs full on leg stump and that's a lovely clean strike. Clears his front leg and hits through the line, up and over mid-on;
71.3;?;Siddle to Holder, no run back of a length outside off, again it seems to stop on the batsman as he looks to punch off the back foot. Again it rolls off the inside edge into the leg side;
71.2;?;Siddle to Holder, no run length ball on off stump, blocked into the covers;
71.1;1;Siddle to Ramdin, 1 run back of a length close to off stump, forced through point off the back foot;
70.6;?;Marsh to Holder, no run length ball outside off, left alone;
70.5;1;Marsh to Ramdin, 1 run fullish close to off stump, stopped on the batsman a little as he came forward to drive, and he checked his shot and popped it in the air, into the vacant area to the left of short extra cover;
70.4;1;Marsh to Holder, 1 run full outside off, gets forward for a checked drive into the covers, where a misfield allows them the single;
70.3;?;Marsh to Holder, no run length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler;
70.2;1;Marsh to Ramdin, 1 run fullish on middle stump and he clips it down to long leg;
70.1;?;Marsh to Ramdin, no run fullish outside off, angling in. No footwork as he goes for the drive, and instead of shooting away into the covers, it rolls apologetically into the leg side;
69.6;?;Siddle to Holder, no run fullish outside off, not quite a half-volley but he times it very well on the up, only for cover to dive to his left and deny him any runs;
69.5;?;Siddle to Holder, no run back of a length on off stump, defended to short cover;
69.4;?;Siddle to Holder, no run in the blockhole on middle and leg, hits Holder low on the front pad as he misses the flick. Big appeal from Siddle, not given. I think Erasmus thinks it's missing leg stump, but Australia have reviewed. Is it bat onto pad? I think the bat hit the foot, and the ball missed the inside edge. Let's see what ball-tracking says... We aren't getting pictures just yet. Ah, finally. Pitches on off and middle, hits on middle and leg. Not sure that's going to hit the stumps. We don't see a predictive path, but Erasmus is already signalling not out. Eagle Eye didn't pick the ball up, I think, and it'll have to stay with the umpire's original decision.;
69.3;?;Siddle to Holder, no run length ball angling into the batsman, clears his front leg and goes for a leg-side slog. Doesn't connect and the ball hits his back leg;
69.2;4;Siddle to Holder, FOUR runs low full-toss on middle and leg, almost lands in the blockhole, and he gets his front foot out of the way to flick it away through square leg, excellent timing;
69.1;?;Siddle to Holder, no run length ball angling into off stump, blocked to short cover;
68.6;?;Pattinson to Ramdin, no run back of a length, fourth-stump line, blocked to short extra cover;
