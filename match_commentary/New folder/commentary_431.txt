Australia 280 all out Breathless stuff after lunch and Australia, having been in all kinds of bother at 8 for 189, have managed to reach a decent total. The pitch looks tacky and has played a little up and down so it will be very hard work for England's batsmen, especially against the new ball. As ever, much will depend on how Johnson goes. Hilfenhaus will be steady, Siddle fiery, but Johnson? Who knows. He batted well and that confidence carries through to his bowling this Test could be very exciting. We also get a first look at Michael Clarke's captaincy at this level. He's never even captained a first-class game, so plenty to look out for.
106.1;W;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, OUT and that will be that. Strange dismissal, Anderson bangs it in very short and it gets very high, Hilfenhaus aims a vertical-batted tennis-smash and ends up with a fine edge through to Prior;Ben Hilfenhaus c ?Prior b Anderson 34 (88m 58b 3x4 1x6) SR: 58.62;
105.6;?;Bresnan to Beer, no run Beer survives. That's all that matters for him. Bresnan hits the off-stump channel and Beer thinks about leaving alone before rushing into a jabbed defence;
105.5;?;Bresnan to Beer, no run short ball into the ribs is well negotiated by Beer who stands tall and fends it down into the leg side;
105.4;1;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, 1 run another swipe from the batsman, doesn't get anywhere near timing it but it runs off the inside edge to midwicket for another single;
105.3;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run this time it's defended off the front foot, no incident here;
105.2;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run Hilfenhaus grins, shrugs his shoulders and chews his gum after missing a very ambitious, down-on-one-knee hoik to deep midwicket;
105.1;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run Bresnan hits back of a length, not allowing Hilfenhaus to swing his arms and it's defended carefully;
104.6;?;Swann to Beer, no run very safe defence receives huge applause from the Australia supporters;
104.5;?;Swann to Beer, no run secure and sturdy defence from Beer, he's got his eye in now;
104.4;?;Swann to Beer, no run Beer looking more confident now as he steps crisply forward in defence;
104.3;1;Swann to Hilfenhaus, 1 run another full-face push, this time wide of the bowler to long-off for a single;
104.2;?;Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run this time it is defended with the straightest of blades to cover;
104.1;4;Swann to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs Swann continues and so does Hilfenhaus! Thrusts a foot down the pitch and swings a slog-sweep powerfully to the square leg rope;
81.6;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run and the over finishes with an elaborate leave from Smith;
81.5;1lb;Tremlett to Johnson, 1 leg bye on the hips, Johnson works it fine for another run;
81.4;1;Tremlett to Smith, 1 run nudged away through square leg for one more run;
81.3;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run right on line from Tremlett, who squares Smith up and gets a thick edge to gully along the ground;
81.2;1;Tremlett to Johnson, 1 run pushed to the leg side, the batsmen take off for a quick single;
81.1;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run Tremlett starts by probing outside off, and it's defended by Johnson;
80.6;?;Anderson to Smith, no run crowd catch! Smith drives a big outswinger to cover, who takes it above his head - though it was a bump ball off the bat;
80.5;?;Anderson to Smith, no run a tighter, attacking line from Anderson, and it's defended;
80.4;?;Anderson to Smith, no run well wide of Smith's off stump, and he shoulders arms;
80.3;1;Anderson to Johnson, 1 run full and swinging away a touch, Johnson gets it off a thickish edge through point to get off the mark;
80.2;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run pushed really wide across Johnson, who leaves it alone;
80.1;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run there's a hint of outswing and Smith leans in to this gentle push, which he steers wide of short cover to pick up a run;
103.6;?;Bresnan to Beer, no run very solid defence to end the over, Bresnan looks for a classic hit-the-top-of-off delivery but finds a similarly textbook defence from the No. 11;
103.5;?;Bresnan to Beer, no run Beer survives again, playing with soft hands to defend to gully;
103.4;1;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, 1 run fuller delivery that finds an inside-edge, thuds onto pad and trickles into the leg side for a single;
103.3;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run another big swing and a miss from the batsman. He's done plenty of that and it's not improving England's mood at all;
103.3;1w;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, 1 wide very short from Bresnan and he's unimpressed as it's called a wide. It was only a fraction over Hilfenhaus's swishing hook shot, so fair enough for the bowler to be annoyed;
103.2;2;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, 2 runs another perfectly-played outside edge over the slips to third man, Pietersen fumbles which makes a tight second run a touch easier;
103.1;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run Bresnan hammers away at a fullish length on off stump and Hilfenhaus defends carefully;
102.6;2;Swann to Beer, 2 runs Beer has his first runs in Test cricket, flipping this around the corner for a couple;
102.5;?;Swann to Beer, no run fuller ball is driven, without any real power, to mid-off;
102.4;?;Swann to Beer, no run neatly nudged into the leg side;
102.3;?;Swann to Beer, no run again Beer manages to defend well enough;
102.2;?;Swann to Beer, no run careful defence from Beer, not looking hopeless at all at No. 11;
102.1;1;Swann to Hilfenhaus, 1 run great shot for one, Hilfenhaus probably ran because he thought the shot deserved something, he skipped down the wicket, opened his body and stroked a firm extra-cover drive to sweeper on the off side rope;
79.6;W;PD Collingwood to Hussey, OUT oh, Collingwood has struck! And it's Hussey who goes - what a very good ball from Paul Collingwood! He'd set up Hussey with several wider balls and this one swung back in, getting the inside edge on to the stumps;Michael Hussey b Collingwood 33 (113m 92b 2x4 0x6) SR: 35.86;
79.5;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run full, wide, driven, fielded at cover;
79.4;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run width from Collingwood, tempting Hussey, who crunches it to cover again;
79.3;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run again Hussey drives hard and straight to the man at cover;
79.2;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run driven to cover this time, there's a man at short cover, but Hussey goes along the ground to the man deeper at cover;
79.1;2;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 2 runs yes, well, a short ball from Paul Collingwood to Mike Hussey is always going to be pulled - but he hasn't placed it well enough to reach the boundary, and it's cut off at deep square leg;
78.6;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run good placement from Hussey, as he opens up his stance to steer a drive through cover, Pietersen at mid-off runs across to keep it to a single;
78.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run again Hussey defends solidly;
78.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey leans forward to defend Swann, who is over the wicket to the left-hander;
78.3;1;Swann to Smith, 1 run fuller ball now, Smith drives down the ground to long-on;
78.2;?;Swann to Smith, no run again Smith flicks it wide of short leg;
78.1;?;Swann to Smith, no run turning on to the pads and Smith works it to leg;
101.6;?;Bresnan to Beer, no run without looking all that secure, Beer has managed to stab a defence;
101.5;1;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, 1 run Bresnan has his fastest wheels on at the moment but Hilfenhaus's inside-edge has earned him the result he wants, a single, leaving Beer just a single delivery to survive;
101.4;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run sharp yorker from Bresnan. That's the first yorker England have landed I think, Hilfenhaus has his eye in and manages to jab this out;
101.3;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run banged in short again and Hilfenhaus aims a wheeling hook shot, only to miss again;
101.2;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run haha, Hilfenhaus tried to give this plenty of humpty but with head up and the ball short he was never going to connect;
101.1;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run banged in shorter and Hilfenhaus wasn't rushing up the wicket this time, tucks him up in defence;
100.6;?;Swann to Beer, no run Beer survives, patting this back to Swann leaving Hilfenhaus another over against Bresnan;
100.5;?;Swann to Beer, no run this is more securely defended off the front foot, much to the delight of the crowd;
100.4;?;Swann to Beer, no run ah, lovely quicker ball, fired in flat outside off stump and past a hapless Beer outside edge;
100.3;1;Swann to Hilfenhaus, 1 run Hilfenhaus has seen enough and aims a big swing to deep midwicket, not quite timing it well but earns a single;
100.2;?;Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run again Swann gives it some air and it's patted back to the bowler;
100.1;?;Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run Hilfenhaus pokes this back to the bowler;
99.6;?;Bresnan to Beer, no run Beer gets a massive cheer for successfully defending his first ball in Test cricket;
99.5;W;Bresnan to Johnson, OUT that will be all, ends a brilliant counter-attacking innings from Johnson. Maybe he didn't need to play this but he was on a roll. Full from Bresnan around off stump and Johnson aimed a cow-corner swish and missed it, allowing it to clip the top of off stump;Mitchell Johnson b Bresnan 53 (89m 66b 5x4 1x6) SR: 80.3;
99.4;1;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, 1 run back of a length delivery around off stump finds a thickish edge that skews to point for a single;
99.3;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run banged in short and sharp from Bresnan and Hilfenhaus aims an almighty hoik, swishing at fresh air as it zips through to Prior;
99.2;1;Bresnan to Johnson, 1 run better delivery from Bresnan, fuller and straighter, clipped firmly to long-on and Johnson happy to take the single;
99.1;2;Bresnan to Johnson, 2 runs touch wide from Bresnan and it's punished with a clunking cut shot that speeds out to deep point for a couple;
98.6;?;Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run very correct forward block to finish the over;
98.5;?;Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run Hilfenhaus skips down the wicket this time, only to defend. Huge cheers for everything now;
98.4;1;Swann to Johnson, 1 run fifty for Johnson - what a knock! Nudges this around the corner for a single to earn a standing ovation;
98.3;?;Swann to Johnson, no run massive cheer as Johnson stretches forward to defend;
98.2;6;Swann to Johnson, SIX runs even better! Johnson down the wicket as Swann offers up some air. Johnson swings powerfully across the line, hammering a long way into the stands at cow corner;
98.1;4;Swann to Johnson, FOUR runs bang! Resounding crack reverberated all around the SCG as Johnson came down the wicket and clumped this to cow corner, flat and hard for four;
97.6;6;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, SIX runs hello! What about that!? Incredible stroke. Hilfenhaus saunters down the wicket and thumps this over long-on, scattering the crowds;
97.5;1;Bresnan to Johnson, 1 run Johnson gets his single, good work from him! Each run being cheered now, there is a feelgood factor to Australia at the moment. Johnson backs away, gets a yorker from Bresnan and digs it out wide of cover to scamper a single;
97.4;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run this is a bit of a whoosh, swiping across the line at thin air;
97.3;2;Bresnan to Johnson, 2 runs ooh dear, England are ticking now! Thoroughly unamused as Johnson lands a crisp cover drive out to long off, somehow Johnson gets two for it;
97.2;2;Bresnan to Johnson, 2 runs two more now, Johnson aims a booming drive and it skews off an inside edge towards deep midwicket;
97.1;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run Bresnan shoves this wide across Johnson who leaves well alone. The field is set far and wide;

96.5;?;Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run England appeal as this spins past the inside edge and bobbles off to Collingwood at slip;
96.4;?;Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run that demon Hilfenhaus edge skews this towards point, batsmen thought about one but didn't take it;
96.3;?;Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run studious defence from Hilfenhaus on the front foot;
96.2;1;Swann to Johnson, 1 run single for Johnson brings up the 50 stand from 68 balls, hugely valuable partnership is reached with a push to cover;
96.1;?;Swann to Johnson, no run full and Johnson crisply picks out the one infielder on the leg side;
95.6;4b;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, 4 byes oh no! Horrid delivery. Bresnan fires this a mile down the leg side, Prior diving at full stretch can't reach it. Should have been wides but either way, Australia are flying after lunch;
95.5;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run flash and a miss. Bresnan aims full and it swings past an airy drive;
95.4;1;Bresnan to Johnson, 1 run field set very deep in the leg side means Johnson can pick off a single;
95.3;2;Bresnan to Johnson, 2 runs wow, that's some shot! Maybe Johnson was watching Trescothick videos as well at lunch, he stands still here and thumps a perfectly-straight batted drive down the ground. It deserved four but a tumbling stop from Trott saves the boundary;
95.2;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run Johnson has spent his lunch time watching Michael Hussey videos and mocks the style by leaving well alone outside off stump;
95.1;1;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, 1 run Hilfenhaus thick-edges again to begin the session, it sails through a gap to third man. Good start for Australia;
94.6;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run cut to point and can't find the gap;
94.5;1;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, 1 run edged and it's just safe! Hilfenhaus gets a single as this one flies in the air to the left of the diving gully, not far away at all!;
94.4;1;Tremlett to Johnson, 1 run down leg side again, Johnson pulls it fine and thinks about taking two but has to settle for a single;
94.3;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run Johnson cuts hard in the air to deep point, and declines the single with only three more balls to come until lunch;
94.2;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run pushed really wide of off now, and Johnson looks to pull but this one then swings further away and he can't connect;
94.1;4;Tremlett to Johnson, FOUR runs more runs for Johnson, wrong line from Tremlett as he strays on the pads and Johnson just glances it fine and runs it away to the boundary;
93.6;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run and the inswinger finishes the over, but it's defended safely by Hilfenhaus;
93.5;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run almost identical! Again, it's beaten the outside edge as it curves prodigiously;
93.4;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run beaten! Another really lovely piece of bowling, swinging away and unluckily for England not finding the outside edge;
93.3;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run pushed along the ground to gully now, just trying to find that gap again;
93.2;2;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, 2 runs Hilfenhaus decides attack is the best form of defence, swiping hard at a wide one outside off, and he's launched it high and safe over the head of point;
93.1;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run another good ball from Bresnan, who beats Hilfenhaus outside off with an outswinger;
92.6;1lb;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, 1 leg bye swinging down leg again, Hilfenhaus gets it away behind square for a run and he'll retain the strike;
92.5;?;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run attacking the body now, it's pushed away to mid-on;
92.4;?;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run wide of off and swinging away - Hilfenhaus chases it and tries to guide it through gully but doesn't connect;
92.3;1;Tremlett to Johnson, 1 run worked away off the legs through square for a single;
92.2;1;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, 1 run bouncer from Tremlett but it's on the leg side and Hilfenhaus helps the pull on its way, in the air to fine leg and walks through for the single, allowing Johnson to take the strike;
92.1;?;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run Hilfenhaus dances down the pitch! Hugely entertaining, even though his swipe didn't connect. Tremlett, not surprisingly, looks a bit miffed by that!;
91.6;4;Bresnan to Johnson, FOUR runs that's a much better pull from Johnson, as he gets one down leg and rolls the wrists to run that away along the ground to the boundary at deep backward square;
91.5;2;Bresnan to Johnson, 2 runs pulled high in the air, and Johnson doesn't quite time it but gets just enough on that for it to land safely out of the reach of mid-on, who was running back;
91.4;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run nudged defensively to cover;
91.3;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run again Johnson leaves a ball that is pushed across him;
91.2;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run bouncer, and well directed - Johnson is in two minds and tries to swipe a hook but doesn't connect;
91.1;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run angled across Johnson, who lets it go through to Prior;
90.6;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run left alone outside off, and Johnson will keep the strike;
90.5;4;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs a boundary for Hilf! Anderson has swung that on to the pads a touch too much and it's been lifted uppishly over square leg and bounces away to the boundary;
90.4;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run that's pretty well negotiated by Hilfenhaus, because it was a good inswinger on the stumps and he's driven it hard back to Anderson, who also did very well to field it;
90.3;1;Anderson to Johnson, 1 run driven down to long-on for an easy single;
90.2;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run swinging down leg, and Johnson can't connect;
90.1;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run defended away to the off side;
89.6;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run swinging in to the pads of Hilfenhaus, who pushes to mid-on;
89.5;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run swinging away, and it's left alone;
89.4;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run again Hilfenhaus steers it towards gully, can't find the gap this time;
89.3;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run great ball! Outstanding delivery from Bresnan, who angles it in to off stump and then swings it away, just beating both the outside edge and the stumps;
89.2;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run left alone well outside off;
89.1;1;Bresnan to Johnson, 1 run a mix-up here, as Johnson gets it away off his legs and there's an easy single, but the batsmen haven't decided whether to take it! Eventually they go, Prior collects and hits the stumps but Hilfenhaus was just home;
88.6;4;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs ah, he's drawn the genuine outside edge from Hilfenhaus but that has gone finer than the man at gully and runs away for a boundary - unlucky for Anderson;
88.5;1lb;Anderson to Johnson, 1 leg bye Johnson gets off the strike now with a leg-bye worked square;
88.4;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run pushed further across Johnson, who leaves it;
88.3;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run yikes, that's ugly! That swipe from Johnson isn't in the textbook, and he didn't connect as he tried to heave it over midwicket from outside off;
88.2;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run again Anderson swings it in, looking to get through Johnson, but he defends solidly;
88.1;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run swinging in to Johnson's pads, and he works it to leg;
87.6;?;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run ouch! Hilfenhaus takes another blow to the body as this one angles in towards him on a good length, getting Hilfenhaus in the midriff;
87.5;1;Tremlett to Johnson, 1 run ah, but Tremlett goes down leg and allows a single as Johnson glances off his hip;
87.4;2;Tremlett to Johnson, 2 runs good running from Johnson, he's got a shortish ball and pulled hard into the ground and away to deep midwicket, running hard to get back for two;
87.3;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run driven to deep point, and some slow-hand clapping begins now as again Johnson refuses the single;
87.2;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run Johnson has some width outside off, he's driven hard to deep cover but declines the single, interesting;
87.1;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run Johnson pushes off the back foot down towards mid-off;
86.6;2;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, 2 runs and Hilfenhaus gets off the mark with a gentle nudge behind point, also ensuring that he gets back for two to give Johnson the strike;
86.5;3;Anderson to Johnson, 3 runs Anderson goes the fuller ball, looking for the inswinger, but Johnson is good enough to drive this back past the bowler along the ground and he collects three more;
86.4;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run on the back foot, Johnson punches to mid-on;
86.3;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run pushed across Johnson, who looks to play and then brings the bat back inside the line;
86.2;4;Anderson to Johnson, FOUR runs Johnson breaks the shackles now with a confident drive over the man at cover, he hasn't tried to keep that down at all, just driving hard and gets enough on it to reach the boundary;
86.1;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run again Anderson gets it moving away from Johnson, who looks to play outside off but can't connect;
85.6;?;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run pushed away to point and can't find the gap;
85.5;?;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run good ball, excellent delivery first up for Hilfenhaus to have to deal with! It's a good length but has really risen sharply and struck Hilfenhaus on the shoulder. How that has bounced that much is a mystery!;
85.4;1b;Tremlett to Johnson, 1 bye well now, that's interesting, the ball has shaped a little after being left alone by Johnson and Prior has taken it on the thumb, allowing a bye as it deflects. He's lucky not to have broken his thumb, there;
85.3;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run on the leg stump, Johnson defends back down the pitch;
85.2;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run wider of off and Johnson leaves it alone;
85.1;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run Tremlett pushes it across Johnson, who leaves it;
84.6;W;Anderson to Siddle, OUT Anderson has two in the over! Siddle has edged this to first slip, and Strauss takes a catch fairly low to the ground as the ball seemed to take forever to reach him;Peter Siddle c Strauss b Anderson 2 (2m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
84.5;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run shorter and wider, Siddle leaves it alone;
84.4;2;Anderson to Siddle, 2 runs and Siddle just rides this short-of-a-length delivery outside off, he steers it nicely fine of gully and picks up some runs;
84.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run fullish and swinging away, Siddle defends;
84.2;W;Anderson to Smith, OUT Anderson strikes! Smith has gone for the big expansive off drive and has only managed to edge it to Collingwood, who takes a standard catch at third slip. Good outswing bowling, not clever batting;Steven Smith c Collingwood b Anderson 18 (85m 53b 1x4 0x6) SR: 33.96;
84.1;?;Anderson to Smith, no run good outswing from Anderson, but Smith doesn't have to play a shot, and doesn't;
83.6;4;Tremlett to Johnson, FOUR runs width for Johnson and he has a dip - cutting hard and finding the space just wide of third slip, that gets to the boundary at third man;
83.5;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run Tremlett is testing Johnson on off stump with the ball that just goes on with the natural angle - the batsman defends;
83.4;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run Johnson defends from the off stump;
83.3;3;Tremlett to Smith, 3 runs confident cover drive from Smith, he beats the fielder but the outfield isn't super fast and they have to settle for three;
83.2;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run there's a bit of a caught-behind shout from England, but none of the players seemed entirely convinced and neither was Aleem Dar. Replays show that went between bat and body, and flicked Smith's jumper on the way through;
83.1;4;Tremlett to Smith, FOUR runs genuine edge and that will run away to the boundary at third man! That wasn't what Smith had in mind for his first boundary of the innings - it safely bounced short of the cordon and in any case it was wide of third slip;
82.6;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run left alone outside off;
82.5;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run and now Anderson sends down the inswinger, which Johnson manages to keep out and work to leg;
82.4;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run Johnson chases this one a little, and ends up just pushing it to cover;
82.3;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run beaten outside off, good ball from Anderson as he gets some terrific movement away from the left-hander;
82.2;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run good ball, this one bounces sharply off a good length and surprises Johnson, who nonetheless manages to defend it;
82.1;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run Anderson gets a bit of swing away from Johnson, who lets it through to Prior;
77.6;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run almost some luck for England here! Hussey, for no good reason, inside edges his defence onto pad and it loops up, Collingwood runs forward and dives to try and take the catch but can't;
77.5;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run touch short this time, means Hussey can sit and wait for a long time on the back foot before pushing to cover;
77.4;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run head over ball in sublime Hussey defence. He's seeing off the old ball;
77.3;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run nothing more than a foot and a half outside off stump but that's all the invitation Hussey needs to shoulder arms;
77.2;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run this is a touch leg-sided and allows Hussey to flick to short midwicket, where Trott dives smartly to field;
77.1;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run starts wonderfully straight, as all the England bowlers seam to, and Hussey can do nothing but defend;
76.6;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run lovely shot again from Hussey, skipping down the track and flicking to deep midwicket;
76.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run angled into Hussey quick and flat from around the wicket, but Hussey remains solid in defence;
76.4;1;Swann to Smith, 1 run urgh, horrid delivery, really dragged down short and Smith had a long, long time to get into position and pull to deep square;
76.3;?;Swann to Smith, no run this is slower and a touch loopier, bounces too and Smith sniffs the ball in defence;
76.2;?;Swann to Smith, no run once again Smith does his best Atherton impression, albeit without the technique;
76.1;?;Swann to Smith, no run Swann hangs this outside off stump asking Smith to attack, but nothing from the batsman;
75.6;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run fuller this time but the line remains impeccable, as does Hussey's defence;
75.5;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run out of nowhere Bresnan lands a cracker! Slanted across the left hander but it jumped and zipped away off a length, climbing past the outside edge;
75.4;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run Hussey has done nothing wrong in defence this morning;
75.3;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run careful and resolute defence from Hussey again;
75.2;1;Bresnan to Smith, 1 run Smith toe-ends a drive towards cover where Collingwood scoots around, picks up smartly and narrowly misses the stumps with his throw. Smith would have been home but it was tight because he had to run around Bresnan, which is no mean feat;
75.1;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run back of a length from Bresnan around off stump, quality defensive bowling;
74.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run oooh, lovely bowling, touch of spin from a slower, looped up delivery. Hussey tried to turn to leg but played too early and it came off a leading edge;
74.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run nicely bowled here, just a touch slower and Hussey defends with an open face;
74.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey is down the track this time, pushing wide of Swann who skips round to field off his own bowling;
74.3;1;Swann to Smith, 1 run nicely played this time, Smith skipping up the wicket and clipping to a deep-sit mid-on. Quite why mid-on isn't saving one is beyond me;
74.2;?;Swann to Smith, no run this time it's patted away into the off side;
74.1;?;Swann to Smith, no run Smith shuffles down the wicket here, causing all kinds of excitement for the England fielders, but he only defends;
73.6;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run maiden over ends with Hussey flagging another one through to Prior;
73.5;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run Bresnan hits a very straight line on a length and Hussey offers a perfect forward defence;
73.4;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run good carry and plenty of cheers from the England slips, but Hussey is simply leaving alone;
73.3;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run good delivery here, this really does bounce from a length, Prior collected above his head as Hussey leaves well alone;
73.2;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run Bresnan adjusts his line, hugging off stump here and forcing a slightly open-faced defence;
73.1;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run Hussey is happy to play the waiting game, leaving alone anything outside his eyeline wide of off stump;
72.6;?;Swann to Smith, no run watchful defence from Smith, he's really buckled down this morning but should Australia try to attack the old ball?;
72.5;?;Swann to Smith, no run Smith doesn't try anything as expansive and instead defends from the crease;
72.4;3;Swann to Hussey, 3 runs ah, this is such a good shot and backed up by excellent running. Hussey skips down the wicket in a flash, turns his wrists over the ball to send it towards deep midwicket and scampers three;
72.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey watches carefully, defending from the crease;
72.2;1;Swann to Smith, 1 run this time Smith gets away from the strike, with a touch of help from inside edge as it squirts away square on the leg side;
72.1;?;Swann to Smith, no run Swann is throwing it up, trying to tempt Smith into something immoral, but nothing but the most upright defence;
71.6;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run and once again it's left alone outside off stump;
71.5;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run tempter, dished up full and pushed across Hussey from over the wicket, but Hussey will not fall for such tricks;
71.4;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run excellent length and line this time, forces Hussey to busily defend back to the bowler;
71.3;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run wide of off stump again from Bresnan to Hussey, and we all know what that means;
71.2;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run Hussey on the other hand looks serene, stroking a back-foot drive to point;
71.1;1;Bresnan to Smith, 1 run Bresnan bangs in a short ball and Smith looks rushed on a pull shot, ends up swiping it away one-handed, didn't look at all comfortable;
70.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Swann does force Hussey to play this time, defending off the front foot to cover;
70.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run spinner of paceman, wide of off Hussey will leave alone. You bowl to him, that's the rule;
70.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Swann angles one into Hussey's pads from around the wicket, Hussey flicks to leg only to find Cook;
70.3;1;Swann to Smith, 1 run quicker, fuller and Smith was late on it. Squeezed it off the toe-end down to short fine leg to get away from the strike;
70.2;?;Swann to Smith, no run Smith looks twitchy but his defence here is solid;
70.1;?;Swann to Smith, no run Smith shuffles across his stumps to defend off the back foot;
69.6;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run this one keeps a touch low, which suggests some uneven bounce is around, too wide of off to cause trouble though;
69.5;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run decent pace from Bresnan, and there is still a bit of bounce with the old ball, but the line is wide enough for Hussey to let go;
69.4;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run patted back to the bowler;
69.3;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run touch shorter this time and Hussey leaves alone outside off stump;
69.2;2;Bresnan to Hussey, 2 runs really good shot this, minimal risk but Hussey strokes a length ball on the up between cover and point for a couple;
69.1;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run Bresnan hits a good length and line and finds typically compact Hussey defence;
68.6;?;Swann to Smith, no run hint of spin here from outside off stump and Smith watchfully pats it to cover;
68.5;?;Swann to Smith, no run short again but the cut picks out cover;
68.4;?;Swann to Smith, no run really short delivery this time but Smith had committed early to sweep and earns him nothing as his straight-arm jab finds midwicket;
68.3;?;Swann to Smith, no run;
68.2;?;Swann to Smith, no run better delivery, fuller and teasing Smith to drive, but drive he does not;
68.1;?;Swann to Smith, no run touch short to begin with and it sits up but Smith only defends to cover;
67.6;4;Bresnan to Hussey, FOUR runs Hussey's reward for all this leaves is a half-volley that is clunked very firmly back past the bowler for four. Really high class batting that over;
67.5;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run well judged this leave, started around middle but the angle took it wide of off;
67.4;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run if he doesn't have to play, he won't. Wide of off stump and Hussey has nothing to do with it;
67.3;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run once again Hussey leaves alone outside off stump;
67.2;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run better delivery this time, just a touch fuller, and Hussey stretches forward to defend;
67.1;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run starts well enough finding a line just outside off stump that Hussey leaves alone;
66.6;2;Anderson to Smith, 2 runs Smith is away, and that will annoy England, particularly because it was due to a misfield. Fullish from Anderson driven carefully straight of mid-on where Tremlett couldn't quite get down in time as he dived and it went through him. Brings up the 150;
66.5;?;Anderson to Smith, no run similar ball - on a length, wide of off stump - Smith has nothing to do with it again;
66.4;?;Anderson to Smith, no run Smith continues his watchful start by letting this go by outside off stump;
66.3;3;Anderson to Hussey, 3 runs Hussey loves anything short, easy for him to rock back and pull firmly behind square. His excellent running earns three;
66.2;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run beaten outside off stump, Hussey completely stuck on the crease and this zipped away off a fullish length past a hanging defensive blade;
66.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run just back of a good length from Anderson, the line is bang on off stump and Hussey hops back to defend;
65.6;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run maiden over, frustrating one for Smith, ends with Tremlett hitting a full length around off stump and forcing careful defence;
65.5;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run grunt from Tremlett as he bangs this in much shorter, Smith has plenty of time to duck underneath it;
65.4;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run once again Bell at cover point saves a powerful shot, diving to his right to stop Smith's cover drive. Pressure building;
65.3;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run excellent line and length here from Tremlett ensures Smith can do nothing but defend off the front foot;
65.2;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run another very smart piece of fielding allows Tremlett to get away with a short and wide one, Bell at point dives to save a powerfully struck back-foot drive to keep Smith pinned on 0;
65.1;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run Tremlett wills himself to a fullish length and Smith wills himself to get forward in defence;
64.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run England's fielding has been nothing short of sublime all tour, it's been central to their 'bowling dry' strategy, and here a leg-side clip finds Tim Bresnan diving smartly at square leg to prevent one;
64.5;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run once again Hussey clips to leg off the back foot, finding midwicket as he does so;
64.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run there is a touch of extra bounce here from a good length, Hussey always plays late so is in a comfortable position to stand tall and nudge to leg;
64.3;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run good delivery here, fullish and aiming for around off stump, Hussey sniffs the ball in defence;
64.2;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run too wide of leg the ball before and a touch too wide of off this time, Hussey happily lets it go;
64.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run good delivery to a right-hander, but not to a southpaw as it is slipped down the leg side;
63.6;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run precious leave alone as Smith lifts his bat high out of trouble;
63.5;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run this is defended more securely around off stump;
63.4;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run this is the sort of shot that makes Smith look a No. 8, solid delivery moving away from an off-stump channel and Smith fences a defence, bat far away from body;
63.3;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run touch short but very straight as always and Smith hops back, gets squared up, but defends well;
63.2;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run classic Hussey batting this, watches a good delivery onto the bat, drops to cover and skips a single;
63.1;2;Tremlett to Hussey, 2 runs Tremlett gets his line a touch wrong here to Hussey, allowing a controlled leg-side clip around the corner for a couple;
62.6;?;Anderson to Smith, no run Anderson dishes up a tempter full outside off stump, Smith is wise enough to let it go by;
62.5;?;Anderson to Smith, no run good delivery to the new batsman, fired just short of a length and into the body and Smith gets into a typically awkward position - squared up - to defend;
62.4;W;Anderson to Haddin, OUT big wicket for England! Anderson gets his man again. Poor shot really, the last ball swung in but this just held its line wide of off stump and Haddin, feet rooted to the spot, flashed a airy drive. Flicked the edge and Prior did the rest;Brad Haddin c ?Prior b Anderson 6 (15m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 46.15;
62.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run good response from Anderson, fuller inswinger, Haddin trapped on the crease a touch, not moving his feet much this morning and inside edges onto his pads;
62.2;2;Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs enough width, and it's only about a couple of feet, outside off for Haddin to stroke a square drive for a couple;
62.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run Anderson is just short of an ideal length and it allows Haddin to defend off the back foot;

Steve Smith, demoted to No. 7 after his struggles this series, now has a huge job to do with Hussey.
 Innings Start
So, England lead by 364, and Watson and Hughes run off the field to get padded up for what will be an interesting second innings. Clearly there are plenty of runs in the pitch, but they cannot win from here, and sometimes that changes the mindset. Let's see how this pans out. England have just under five sessions to secure a 3-1 win.
177.5;W;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, OUT gone this time, it's all over as Tremlett gets a thin edge behind to a good ball just a touch outside off, Haddin takes the catch;Chris Tremlett c ?Haddin b Hilfenhaus 12 (31m 28b 1x4 0x6) SR: 42.85;
177.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run beaten outside off, Hilfenhaus hasn't aimed at the stumps yet in this over;
177.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run fuller now and swinging on to the pads of Tremlett;
177.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run bouncer - Tremlett sways out of the way;
177.1;1;Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run nudged away to point and Hussey at gully runs across and shies at the stumps, Tremlett was gone there, but the throw couldn't connect;
176.6;4;Beer to Tremlett, FOUR runs oh, good shot! Beer gave that a heap of air, and Tremlett has waited on it and driven powerfully through cover, all the way along the ground;
176.5;1;Beer to Swann, 1 run premeditated sweep from way outside off stump, Swann lobs it safely behind square;
176.4;1;Beer to Tremlett, 1 run curves in trying to get through the gate, but Tremlett is good enough to push a single through gully;
176.3;?;Beer to Tremlett, no run Beer really tosses this up and Tremlett advances, then jams it out to cover;
176.2;?;Beer to Tremlett, no run defended back down the pitch;
176.1;1;Beer to Swann, 1 run Beer begins after the break, and Swann pushes a single gently through square leg;
175.6;?;Siddle to Tremlett, no run steered to point to finish the over and another domineering session;
175.5;?;Siddle to Tremlett, no run touch shorter this time, but it's outside off stump and left alone;
175.4;?;Siddle to Tremlett, no run this is much fuller and Tremlett eases forward to defend;
175.3;?;Siddle to Tremlett, no run Siddle's response is to dig it in short and it sconnes Tremlett on the nut! Long way up that, good bouncer. Tremlett looks utterly unworried though;
175.2;2;Siddle to Tremlett, 2 runs top shot! Tremlett lands a cover drive, timing it nicely for a couple;
175.1;1lb;Siddle to Swann, 1 leg bye this crashes off the legs into the square leg region for a dribbled single;
174.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run again Tremlett finds ball hitting bat, but only in defence;
174.5;2;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, 2 runs misfield from none other than Mitchell Johnson, making a hash of a routine stop at cover, gives Tremlett a couple;
174.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run finally it is delivered properly and Tremlett defends;
174.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run this time Tremlett manages to get solid bat on ball, clunking a defence to cover;
174.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run dug in a touch short and Tremlett fences and misses outside off;
174.1;1;Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run Swann gets another single off the first ball of the over, smashing a pull shot to deep midwicket;
173.6;?;Siddle to Tremlett, no run Tremlett is batting like a real No. 11, he gets a full ball outside off, swishes a drive at fresh air;
173.5;?;Siddle to Tremlett, no run good nip again from Siddle, moving the ball in off the pitch. Cuts Tremlett, this time, in half as he tired to defend;
173.4;?;Siddle to Tremlett, no run good yorker, fired in full and straight and Tremlett, whose bat seems to be far too small for him, digs it out;
173.3;1;Siddle to Swann, 1 run Siddle doing the right thing and hammering down a short ball, Swann on the pull again without really timing it and it goes one-bounce to deep square;
173.2;?;Siddle to Swann, no run beaten again, good delivery this, zipping in off a length and slicing Swann in half;
173.1;?;Siddle to Swann, no run hammered in short and Swann has a swipe and misses. Australia appeal unsuccessfully and opt for a review which seems to confirm that there was no edge;
172.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run after all the frolics of the last over this is a grizzly maiden sealed with Tremlett leaving alone outside off;
172.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run full again from Hilfenhaus and Tremlett full-faces a drive to mid-on;
172.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run full ball, which makes sense to Tremlett, and it beats the outside edge;
172.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run this time it's worked off the leg towards square leg, who scoots around sharply to save the single;
172.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run short again and Tremlett stands up, and it's a long way up, to prod this to leg;
172.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Tremlett, no run Hilfenhaus bangs in a short ball outside off stump that Tremlett nods at;
171.6;3;Johnson to Tremlett, 3 runs expensive over! Johnson finds the edge finally, but sure enough it goes down, beats gully and runs away towards the third-man boundary. 20 runs from that over;
171.5;3;Johnson to Swann, 3 runs three more now! Australia are already hurting but this is rubbing it in. Full again and Swann aims a booming drive over mid-on that skews off an inside edge a touch but runs away towards the rope;
171.4;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs oh dear! Don't bowl there to Swann. Full with a bit of width, Swann is actually a very natural timer down the ground and smashes this over mid-off for four. Top shot;
171.3;2;Johnson to Swann, 2 runs runs flowing! Johnson goes full so Swann full-faces a drive down the ground, beating mid-off for a couple more;
171.2;6;Johnson to Swann, SIX runs short again, which is the right move, but Swann top-edges an attempted hook and it sails into the crowd at fine leg;
171.1;2;Johnson to Swann, 2 runs Johnson slaps down a short ball that Swann hooks with good timing down to deep square for a couple;
170.6;W;Hilfenhaus to Prior, OUT Prior's wonderful exhibition innings ends with Prior managing, somehow, to toe-end an attempted upper-cut to a shocking short and wide delivery. Oh dear... what have we here? Bowden has called for a review unsure if it's a no-ball!... After a few looks, confirmation that Hilfenhaus did indeed have a millimetre of his boot behind the line when he landed before sliding forward. All of which means Prior's wonderful maiden Ashes hundred comes to an end;Matt Prior c ?Haddin b Hilfenhaus 118 (237m 130b 11x4 1x6) SR: 90.76;
170.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run good length and line from Hilfenhaus and Prior offers a textbook defence;
170.4;1;Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run short ball and immediately Swann is less comfortable, aiming a hook shot but getting nothing more than a bottom edge that trickles away for a single;
170.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run Hilfenhaus loses his line and it flicks off the pads through to Haddin;
170.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run Hilfenhaus offers some width which allows Prior to drive, but the well-timed shot finds cover;
170.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run after his fun last over Swann is in responsible mode, leaving alone outside off stump;
169.6;3;Johnson to Swann, 3 runs full again and Swann continues to have fun. Smashing a drive over mid-off, without timing it perfectly but ridiculous tactics from Johnson;
169.5;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs if it's up there Swann will have a dart. Johnson should be bowling short at him, but the full length, and width, means Swann can free his arms and with some help from the edge collect four to point;
169.4;?;Johnson to Swann, no run horrid delivery dragged short and down the leg side, Swann aims a swish but doesn't connect;
169.3;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs Swann rightly throwing his bat at a fullish ball and it skews off the edge over the slips for four to bring up England's 600. Staggering really;
169.2;1;Johnson to Prior, 1 run enough width here for Prior to drive deep into the off side;
169.1;1;Johnson to Swann, 1 run single takes as Swann pushes this into space;
168.6;1;Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run Swann keeps the strike by flicking a full ball to fine leg;
168.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run the short balls have Swann hanging on the back foot which means he can't time his drive to this fuller delivery;
168.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run this is short again and Swann stands up to defend;
168.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run good bowling this. Swann doesn't fancy short bowling and Hilfenhaus banged this in and rapped Swann on the gloves as he tried to fend away;
168.2;1;Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run width for Prior means another creamy square drive, timed very well but to the man deep on the off side;
168.1;4lb;Hilfenhaus to Prior, 4 leg byes rubbish from Hilfenhaus, just angled down the leg side, flicks the thigh pad and runs away quickly for four leg byes. England near the 600 mark;
167.6;W;Johnson to Bresnan, OUT Bresnan departs and Johnson has his fourth! Finally something for Australia to cheer. Just angling across the right hander, Bresnan popped forward to defend but it clipped the edge and went low to Clarke who held a good catch diving to his right;Tim Bresnan c Clarke b Johnson 35 (116m 103b 5x4 0x6) SR: 33.98;
167.5;1;Johnson to Prior, 1 run short ball and Prior hooks, not perfectly but well enough to earns a single out to deep midwicket;
167.4;4;Johnson to Prior, FOUR runs wonderful shot, as good as the delivery was poor. Dished up full and wide outside off stump, Prior needs no second invitation to drive and absolutely nails it square of the wicket, beating deep cover;
167.3;?;Johnson to Prior, no run hint of width and that's all Prior needs to unfurl a flashing blade. Doesn't connect this time;
167.2;?;Johnson to Prior, no run similar ball demands defence from Prior. Who is timing even his defensive pats supremely;
167.1;?;Johnson to Prior, no run maybe this was what Clarke was discussing, Johnson finding an off-stump line that Prior can only defend;
166.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Bresnan, no run left alone again to end a fairly unmemorable maiden;
166.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Bresnan, no run flash and a miss outside off stump. Bresnan couldn't quite reach it;
166.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Bresnan, no run this time Bresnan does have a dart at one, aiming a back-foot drive. Trickles off the inside edge;
166.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Bresnan, no run Bresnan happy to leave alone outside off stump. he's eyeing a fifty perhaps;
166.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Bresnan, no run bit of width again and Bresnan lets it go by;
166.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Bresnan, no run this barely creeps to Haddin, really slow off the pitch. Bresnan flags it through on its way;
165.6;2;Johnson to Prior, 2 runs Johnson around the wicket now to counter the room Prior likes, overcooks it through and Prior whips off his legs for two more;
165.5;4;Johnson to Prior, FOUR runs no third man in place and room outside off spells trouble against Prior. He slashes a drive which comes off the edge, sails over the slips and runs away for four;
165.4;1lb;Johnson to Bresnan, 1 leg bye back of a length and worked into the leg side off the pads for one;
165.3;4;Johnson to Bresnan, FOUR runs two good balls is Mitchell's quota before the bad one, this is a long half volley, wide of off again and Bresnan smashes a drive through cover very well. Timing is good enough to beat the off-side sweeper;
165.2;?;Johnson to Bresnan, no run good line and length again from Johnson, not often you can say that, Bresnan leaves alone;
165.1;?;Johnson to Bresnan, no run excellent start from Johnson, finds the right length and line. No swing though, and Bresnan confident in defence;
164.6;?;Beer to Prior, no run horrible swipe from Prior, trying to give himself room to free his arms again. Didn't get anything more than a bottom edge. Haddin has a giggle and tries to boot the ball onto the stumps;
164.5;?;Beer to Prior, no run good delivery this time, tossed up and much straighter. Prior pats back to the bowler;
164.4;?;Beer to Prior, no run more width and another crisp drive. Prior finding cover this time;
164.3;?;Beer to Prior, no run width to Prior is fatal if you're a bowler and Beer is lucky to get away with this as Prior picks out Hussey at extra cover;
164.2;1lb;Beer to Bresnan, 1 leg bye similar ball finds a similar shot, Bresnan not quite connecting though and it runs off the pads;
164.1;1;Beer to Prior, 1 run Beer meanders through another delivery, this time angling it into the pads and it's fiddled around the corner for one;
163.6;?;Smith to Bresnan, no run simple defence from Bresnan;
163.5;?;Smith to Bresnan, no run Bresnan content to block off the front foot;
163.4;3;Smith to Prior, 3 runs ah lovely shot. Prior gets a hint of width and waits on a classy back-cut, should have had a boundary but some scampering fielding saves a run;
163.3;?;Smith to Prior, no run prodded into the off side;
163.2;?;Smith to Prior, no run Prior stretches forward and offers a very respectful defence;
163.1;1;Smith to Bresnan, 1 run Bresnan picks off a single, knocking into space;
162.6;?;Beer to Prior, no run the drama is followed by careful defence;
162.5;4;Beer to Prior, FOUR runs this time it's through and that's Prior's hundred - the fastest England Ashes century since Botham in 1981 - it was dished up well outside off and Prior threw his arms through the line, sending it speeding to the extra-cover boundary. He leaps to celebrate;
162.4;?;Beer to Prior, no run with Prior just a boundary away he thought he had it here as he smashed an off drive, but Hussey at extra cover intercepted;
162.3;2;Beer to Prior, 2 runs Prior on the sweep again to Beer, playing it well, fetching it from around off stump and sending it down to fine leg;
162.2;?;Beer to Prior, no run more careful defence from Prior, who'd want to give away an Ashes hundred;
162.1;?;Beer to Prior, no run Beer is showing good control and Prior can only defend;
161.6;4;Smith to Bresnan, FOUR runs bosh! Another one, Bresnan repeats the clear-the-front-leg-and-smash strategy, depositing it over mid-on for four more;
161.5;?;Smith to Bresnan, no run Bresnan stretches forward to defend;
161.4;1;Smith to Prior, 1 run hint of leading edge here but no more than a suggestion as Prior pats down the ground for a single;
161.3;1;Smith to Bresnan, 1 run single taken this time, pushed into space down the ground;
161.2;4;Smith to Bresnan, FOUR runs clunk, Bresnan clears his front leg and hacks through the line, sending it high and handsome over mid-of for plenty;
161.1;?;Smith to Bresnan, no run Smith lands it on a healthy line and length and Bresnan defends;
160.6;2;Beer to Prior, 2 runs another sweep earns another couple. Prior playing the shot well enough to also bring up England's 550. 550;
160.5;2;Beer to Prior, 2 runs this time Prior fetches a sweep from outside off stump, angling it around the corner and Bresnan has to hurry back to get back for a second;
160.4;?;Beer to Prior, no run more sturdy defence to cover;
160.3;?;Beer to Prior, no run Prior on the back foot an unable to time a drive;
160.2;?;Beer to Prior, no run pushed to cover off the back foot. Hint of drift for Beer. Draught perhaps;
160.1;?;Beer to Prior, no run Smith is a touch short but otherwise the line is good and Prior guides to point;
159.6;?;Smith to Bresnan, no run tossed up and it's defended again;
159.5;?;Smith to Bresnan, no run defended towards the leg side;
159.4;?;Smith to Bresnan, no run turns away from the batsman, who leaves it;
159.3;2;Smith to Bresnan, 2 runs a bit too short and Bresnan has plenty of time to cut that away through point;
159.2;?;Smith to Bresnan, no run tossed up towards leg stump, it's defended;
159.1;3;Smith to Prior, 3 runs well played by Prior, he's waited on one that turns away from him and late cuts safely wide of slip, but it's chased down inside the boundary;
158.6;1;Beer to Prior, 1 run drifting in and Prior goes the big backlift, looking for a healthy drive, but then checks and pushes a single to mid off;
158.5;1;Beer to Bresnan, 1 run pushed through cover for an easy single;
158.4;?;Beer to Bresnan, no run drifting down leg and it's flicked off the legs of Bresnan, who can't find a run;
158.3;?;Beer to Bresnan, no run driven back towards Beer;
158.2;?;Beer to Bresnan, no run defended towards the off side;
158.1;1;Beer to Prior, 1 run pushed down the ground for another single;

157.5;1;Siddle to Prior, 1 run jams the bat down on to a yorker and keeps it out;

Pushing a back-foot drive through cover for a couple and after 11 half-centuries against Australia he finally gets the precious hundred.

"Every time I click on the commentary it seems a review has kept an England batsman at the crease or a catch has been dropped. Can't you add a 'Don't look now if you're Australian' notification to your Chrome extension??" Dave asks.
 Innings Start
And finally England take their place on the podium. Michael Vaughan presents the crystal trophy and the replica urn to Strauss, ticker tape flies and the screams begin. We'll be seeing that shot repeated a few times I imagine. Sprinkler anyone? That's all from me, Sahil Dutta, and from Brydon Coverdale and Liam Brickhill. It's been an immensely enjoyable series, thanks for all the emails.
At the other end of the spectrum, Andrew Strauss cannot contain his smile. "We came over here desperate to win the series. We're delighted with what we've done and we're certainly going to enjoy tonight! Alastair has been amazing, when you're talking about people like Wally Hammond you know you've had a special series. Jimmy Anderson has done amazingly well in tough conditions but it's been a fantastic team effort. Paul Collingwood is a massive loss, there is a tinge of sadness there that he's departing, there is so much he brings to the team that you don't see. I'd like to thank our supporters, who've made this feel like a home series and I must thank our wives and families who have to live with this day in day out."
Michael Clarke has had a difficult start to his Test captaincy but fronts up looking as chipper as ever. "It's been a tough couple of months we've been outplayed in all facets of the game. You always enjoy representing your country but it's very disappointing. We'll see what happens [with the captaincy], first I need some runs. Me and all the top order need to contribute. We have a great bunch of guys with a lot of talent but we need to go back to the drawing board and work our backsides off. I don't think it's time to panic. We need to stay strong together and continue to try and get better every single day.
Alastair Cook is named man of the match and man of the series for his 189 and 766 runs in the series. "Amazing, that feeling will live long in the memory. I need to thank all the supporters both here in the ground and at home. It's been a lot of hard work and an amazing series. I couldn't have imagined this seven weeks ago. The 200 was probably the most special moment and to win man of the match in the final game of the Ashes is a dream come true. Our bowlers have been fantastic all the way through and made our job as batters much easier."
Mark Taylor is the master of ceremonies and begins by thanking all the England fans for showing up today. He introduces the presentation party - that includes Glenn McGrath and Michael Vaughan - and I'm not sure McGrath has ever earned such an ovation from England fans! They're in generous mood though and clap happily everyone - even the fourth umpire.
The England players are heading back out now. Full squad in the whites with England caps in place, getting ready for the presentations. There will be plenty written about this match and series - epic dramas and films if England fans had their way - but for now there is no better place to start than Andrew McGlashan's bulletin, so check that out. The Australian players are now making their way out onto the field. I wonder what words were said in their dressing room. Not much I imagine.
England win by an innings and 83 runs and win the series 3-1 Incredible team effort and the players ran into an impromptu huddle, jumping up and down arm in arm. Finally the players part and begin to wander off to meet the dressing-room staff. Paul Collingwood is met and congratulated by a line of Australian players, good to see that, he's had some epic tussles with them over the years.
That's Australia's third innings defeat in the series, an unwelcome first for them and a measure of England's unremitting superiority. They have outthought, outplanned, and thoroughly outplayed Australia in every aspect.
There are all sorts of statistics and records that have been established and broken this series but to get a sense of just how far ahead England have been through the five matches have a look at this which shows that England have averaged 51.14 per wicket compared with Australia's 29.23. Or to put it another way, Australia have been hammered.

83.6;?;Anderson to Beer, no run Beer, amusingly enough, wanted a single here as he fiddles this around the corner. Smith has none of it. He's enjoying his futile half-century;
83.5;?;Anderson to Beer, no run edged again but Beer's soft hands mean Trott at fourth slip dives to save runs rather than take the catch;
83.4;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run haha, Smith really tries to hammer this. But gets barely an edge on it and it dribbles away for a single;
83.3;?;Anderson to Smith, no run again Smith skips leg side but Anderson follows him and it's knocked towards point;

83.1;?;Anderson to Smith, no run Smith needs two for fifty and he aims a big pull at this without connecting and it slams into his midriff;
82.6;?;Tremlett to Beer, no run Beer survives! Anderson gets the chance to try and seal the victory as this is left alone outside off stump;
82.5;?;Tremlett to Beer, no run edged again! But down again. Straight to Anderson in the gully. England fielders are ready to celebrate but it's not their time yet;
82.4;?;Tremlett to Beer, no run not yet! Tremlett finds a good line and length, and also an outside edge, but it runs down to Anderson in the gully who dives well to field;
82.3;3;Tremlett to Smith, 3 runs dug in short and Smith hacks a wonderfully ugly pull shot which means Cook gets to run towards the midwicket ropes and the Barmy Army to collect;
82.2;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run wide of off again from Tremlett and Smith cracks firmly to deep point but he doesn't take the single;
82.1;2;Tremlett to Smith, 2 runs strange looking shot again from Smith. He gets leg side of the ball and slashes out in front of deep point;

81.2;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run hint of an edge here, squirts off the shoulder wide of gully for a single;
81.1;?;Anderson to Smith, no run he won't, however, with deliveries like this. Sliding down the leg side for Prior to collect;
80.6;?;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run an appeal from England to finish the over. Tremlett ventured a touch fuller and nipped one back into the pads. Probably sliding down leg. And heading over. Other than that he was stone dead;
80.5;?;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run ooh, beaten outside off stump. The ball just nipped away off a length but died on it's way to Prior;

79.6;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run Bresnan lands another full and straight ball. That could be his work done because the new ball is available;
79.5;1;Bresnan to Smith, 1 run another firm cover drive, played crisply out to deep point;
79.4;3;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, 3 runs neatly played! As is Hilfenhaus's way there was no great flourish, but a full ball is driven carefully through cover for three;
79.3;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run Hilfenhaus rooted to the crease but manages to prod a defence securely enough to cover;
79.2;?;Bresnan to Hilfenhaus, no run ooh, this swings away past a groping outside edge;

78.4;?;Swann to Smith, no run Smith gets deep into his crease to defend back to the bowler;
78.3;W;Swann to Siddle, OUT eight down now! Siddle departs!

77.4;1;Bresnan to Siddle, 1 run Siddle lands a firm back-foot drive but some smart fielding keeps it to a single;
77.4;1w;Bresnan to Siddle, 1 wide banged in very shot from Bresnan, too short for the umpire's liking;
77.3;1;Bresnan to Smith, 1 run enough width here for Smith to land a crisp drive through extra cover;
77.2;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run strange looking shot from Smith, most are I suppose. It's a fullish length around off stump and Smith aims a stiff-armed expansive drive that skews off the inside edge to mid-on;
77.1;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run more no-nonsense work from Bresnan, hammering away on a length at off stump and Smith defends;
76.6;?;Swann to Siddle, no run another over ticks by. Three more until the new ball now. Siddle works this into the leg side to finish the over. He looks in fine form this morning;

75.6;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run tempting drive-me ball to finish the over but Siddle is forward only to defend;
75.5;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run back of a length, no great pace in the pitch and Smith has an age to stand up and punch a drive to cover;
75.4;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run carefully defended into the off side this time. Bresnan settling into a better line and length than he started the over with;
75.3;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run Smith has great hands, which almost makes up for his lack of anything else (at this stage of his career etc), and he slaps a crisp drive to mid-off;
75.2;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run this time it's left alone outside off stump. Smith booking in for the long haul;
75.1;4;Bresnan to Smith, FOUR runs crash! How did Australia lose to these lot? Bresnan shoves down a short and wide ball that Smith slaps wide of point for four. The Barmy Army are still cheering wildly though;
74.6;4;Swann to Siddle, FOUR runs good shot, it was a bit short and wide, Siddle used his crease well to get back and cut hard through point for a boundary. That was a batsman's shot, not the work of a tailender!;

72.6;2;Tremlett to Siddle, 2 runs flicked in the air through square leg and just out of the reach of the fieldsman, that wasn't far away from being a catch;

47.3;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run this is pushed across Hussey who flashes a drive. England think they have their man as the ball passes near to bat at the same moment Hussey's bat grazes the ground. It created a sound and England decided not to bother with a review;

43.4;W;Anderson to Clarke, OUT this is masterful old-ball bowling from Anderson! Really skillful. Full and angling in before bending away late, just enough to flick the edge of Clarke's defensive push and Prior did the rest;Michael Clarke c ?Prior b Anderson 41 (96m 73b 6x4 0x6) SR: 56.16;

41.6;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run pushed to mid-off, can't find the gap;

36.2;?;Swann to Khawaja, no run defended to off;

30.6;1;Swann to Khawaja, 1 run and Khawaja gets the cut away now, taking a single to point, who misfields slightly;
