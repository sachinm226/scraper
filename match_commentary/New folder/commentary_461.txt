Data
Four fifties for South Africa, and 303 looks like a really good total on what is a dry pitch. Australia looked a bit rattled in the field, but they have the batting fire power to chase down totals. I am not sure if Watson will be allowed to open, or bat with a runner. I am not sure Australia will want to risk a major injury just for an ODI. Do join us around 5.10pm for the chase. Matt from Dubai, you could follow this advice from Azee: "@Matt: Go toSheraton Four Points on Sheikh Zayed Road, they have a pub in there and ask them to put on Ten Sports...just don't get yourself martini there....."
49.6;1;Bollinger to Botha, 1 run slogged away on the leg side, along the ground, for a single;
49.5;1;Bollinger to Boucher, 1 run slog to midwicket, would have been run out had Clarke hit, but he has missed by a long way;
49.4;1;Bollinger to Botha, 1 run slower ball, short of a length, takes a single to mid-off;
49.3;W;Bollinger to Duminy, OUT he has hit the full toss straight down Smith's throat at midwicket. Smith doesn't realise it is a catch, and wants to throw at the non-striker's end. He has a surprised look on his face as neither the non-striker wants to run nor the bowler wants the throw. I think Smith was ready in case it is called no-ball for height;Jean-Paul Duminy c Smith b Bollinger 56 (100m 58b 2x4 2x6) SR: 96.55;
49.2;2;Bollinger to Duminy, 2 runs yorker, middle and leg, squeezed out to long-on, and they are lightning quick to take the second to bring up the 300. The crowd has gone berserk;
49.1;1;Bollinger to Boucher, 1 run Boucher charges at Bollinger, hits him to long-on to bring Duminy back on;
48.6;6;Cummins to Duminy, SIX runs He has found the roof of St George's Park. That landed on tin with a loud thud. Length ball from Cummins, 137ks, Duminy clears the front leg, and lofts it straight over his head. What clean sensible striking here. reaches fifty too;
48.5;1;Cummins to Boucher, 1 run Boucher makes room, this slower ball is outside off, but not too wide, so Boucher has to reach at it, and ends up slogging it down to long-on for one;
48.4;1;Cummins to Duminy, 1 run has to reach for this after he backs away with the front leg, ends up hitting it to mid-off for one;
48.4;1w;Cummins to Duminy, 1 wide slower ball gone wrong, big wide down the leg side;
48.3;1;Cummins to Boucher, 1 run yorker, digs it out to mid-off, takes the single;
48.2;1;Cummins to Duminy, 1 run clears the front leg and swipes again, but this time he can't beat mid-off;
48.1;6;Cummins to Duminy, SIX runs Fast bowlers don't like it, but this happens more often to them nowadays. Slower ball on a length, middle and off, Duminy clears the front leg, and lofts him straight into the sight screen;
47.6;4;Bollinger to Boucher, FOUR runs this time Boucher goes with the angle and down the ground, and benefits. This is a length ball outside off, he drives it on the up, along the ground, and between Bollinger and mid-off. So that wide ends up costing them five;
47.6;1w;Bollinger to Boucher, 1 wide sees him charging at him, Bollinger bowls full and wide outside off, but it is called a wide;
47.5;1;Bollinger to Duminy, 1 run low full toss, no room, driven to sweeper-cover for one;
47.4;1;Bollinger to Boucher, 1 run across the line again, although this time he makes good connection. Bounces short of long-on;
47.3;?;Bollinger to Boucher, no run length ball, outside off, goes across the line, hits it back to Bollinger;
47.2;1;Bollinger to Duminy, 1 run bouncer, pulls this down the ground, gets just the single to long-on;
47.1;1;Bollinger to Boucher, 1 run yorker outside off, digs it out for one. Over to JP;
46.6;1;Cummins to Boucher, 1 run full, just outside off, takes a risky single to cover, and this time Clarke himself fumbles;
46.5;1;Cummins to Duminy, 1 run short of a length, middle and leg, drops and runs, takes a single;
46.4;2;Cummins to Duminy, 2 runs punched on the walk, wide of sweeper-cover, comes back for an easy two;
46.3;1lb;Cummins to Boucher, 1 leg bye length ball, angling down the leg side, concedes a leg-bye;
46.2;2;Cummins to Boucher, 2 runs short of a length, flicked away to the left of fine leg for a couple;
46.1;W;Cummins to Miller, OUT and strikes right away. Miller is gone after playing a forceful, momentum-grabbing innings. He backs away, trying to hit it over the off side, the ball is short of a length, and angles away. A thick edge is taken, and settles with Haddin;David Miller c ?Haddin b Cummins 59 (68m 51b 6x4 1x6) SR: 115.68;
45.6;1;Johnson to Miller, 1 run well bowled, Miller is making room, looking for any sort of lenght to get under. Johnson stays in the block hole, all Miller can do is squeeze it out for a single;
45.5;1;Johnson to Duminy, 1 run short of a length, outside off, runs it down to third man;
45.4;1;Johnson to Miller, 1 run makes room to smash it, mis-hits to midwicket for a risky single, but Smith doesn't collect it cleanly there;
45.3;1;Johnson to Duminy, 1 run pushed down the ground for a single;
45.2;2;Johnson to Duminy, 2 runs pulled away, substitute Mitch Marsh fumbles at deep square to allow the second;
45.1;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run short, not too wide, the cut finds point;
44.6;2;Bollinger to Miller, 2 runs full toss on leg, makes room and drives it past point, to the right of deep cover;
44.5;1;Bollinger to Duminy, 1 run pulled away nicely, gets a single to deep square;
44.4;1;Bollinger to Miller, 1 run full, on the pads, Bollinger is lucky Miller has found short fine leg with this deflection;
44.3;4;Bollinger to Miller, FOUR runs short of a length, middle and off, nips in a touch, Miller gets an inside edge, beating the keeper who dives to his right;
44.2;?;Bollinger to Miller, no run a near yorker, makes room and drives, but can't beat extra cover;
44.1;?;Bollinger to Miller, no run hit straight to midwicket;
43.6;4;Cummins to Duminy, FOUR runs the extra slow bouncer, outside leg, would have been a wide had he not got enough bat on it to beat Haddin and short fine leg;
43.5;4;Cummins to Duminy, FOUR runs no one is going to save this edge from going for four. He looks to go inside-out with this length ball, gets a thick edge, and it flies well fine of third man for Duminy's first four;
43.4;?;Cummins to Duminy, no run slower ball, looks to cut it, gets an inside edge, and Haddin dives to his right to save a few here;
43.3;?;Cummins to Duminy, no run this is a grubber for a bouncer, barely bounces over the stumps, but more incredibly Duminy has ducked under it;
43.2;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run length ball, on off, pushes forward, gets a inside edge to reach his second ODI fifty. Produces a huge applause from the crowd bathed in the sun;
43.1;?;Cummins to Miller, no run skiddy shortish delivery, pulled straight to midwicket;
42.6;1;Bollinger to Miller, 1 run full, on the pads, nicely clipped away for a single;
42.5;1;Bollinger to Duminy, 1 run yorker, on the pads, deflects it behind square;
42.4;1;Bollinger to Miller, 1 run slower ball, on off, pushed to mid-off with soft hands, takes the single;
42.3;?;Bollinger to Miller, no run wide of the crease, angling in, hits the inside edge onto the pad;
42.2;2;Bollinger to Miller, 2 runs length ball, on off, driven wide of sweeper-cover for two runs;
42.1;?;Bollinger to Miller, no run short, into the body, beaten on the pull, hit on the thigh pad;
41.6;?;Smith to Duminy, no run slower through the air, 85ks, outside off, driven straight to extra cover;
41.5;1;Smith to Miller, 1 run googly, too short, too wide, but cut away straight to the sweeper;
41.4;1;Smith to Duminy, 1 run floated across him, he opens the face to take a single;
41.3;2;Smith to Duminy, 2 runs full toss, soft hands again, between deep midwicket and long-on, and they take Warner on to take the second;
41.2;?;Smith to Duminy, no run quick, on the pads, defended back to him;
41.1;2;Smith to Duminy, 2 runs tossed up on off, leaves the crease, places this between deep midwicket and long-on, comes back for two. That's typical Duminy;
40.6;?;Bollinger to Miller, no run full, on off, drives, can't beat mid-off;
40.5;3;Bollinger to Duminy, 3 runs full toss on the pads, Smith misfields at long-on, allows two extra runs. Let the rants resume;
40.4;?;Bollinger to Duminy, no run length ball, middle and off, defended to mid-on;
40.3;?;Bollinger to Duminy, no run looks to work this to leg, is early into the shot, hit on the pad;
40.2;1;Bollinger to Miller, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, worked away for a single;
40.1;4;Bollinger to Miller, FOUR runs and he has been welcomed back with a thump of a pull. Just short of a length, not really sharp, and he muscles it through midwicket;
39.6;1;Johnson to Miller, 1 run this is slightly fuller, and the low full toss has been clipped away square on the leg side;
39.5;?;Johnson to Miller, no run nice yorker, swinging down the leg side, hits him on the toe, appeals for leg-before, but it is slipping down;
39.4;?;Johnson to Miller, no run short of a length, on off, no room, defended back to him;
39.3;1;Johnson to Duminy, 1 run short, outside off, doesn't bounce high, pulled away for a single;
39.2;1;Johnson to Miller, 1 run length, outside off, driven to sweeper-cover for one;
39.1;1;Johnson to Duminy, 1 run runs this down to third man, hands the strike over;
38.6;4;Cummins to Miller, FOUR runs Miller restarts the boundary engine, charging at Cummins. Turns this into a length ball, and drives it through extra cover. Wide of sweeper-cover too;
38.5;?;Cummins to Miller, no run driven, but straight to mid-off;
38.4;?;Cummins to Miller, no run slower bouncer, 118ks, Miller tries to pull twice I think but the ball doesn't arrive. He still has time to try to open the face, the ball hits the toe end, and bounces well short of Haddin;
38.3;1;Cummins to Duminy, 1 run yorker on off, digs it out, moves softly towards mid-off, they have enough time to take the single;
38.2;2;Cummins to Duminy, 2 runs the open face again, this time sufficiently left of third man for them to come back for two;
38.1;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run runs this behind square with an open face;
37.6;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run tucks him up with a short ball, defended;
37.5;1;Johnson to Miller, 1 run punched square for a single;
37.4;1;Johnson to Duminy, 1 run good delivery, though, short getting big on him, but Johnson has missed another run-out. Miller pushes for a single as this rolls to Haddin, but Johnson is not back to collect the throw. Duminy is still going to end up short as Johnson goes to his left to collect the underarm from Haddin. The momentum perhaps makes it really difficult, and Johnson's flick from about six feet misses with Duminy well short;
37.3;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run short and wide, cut away, can't beat point;
37.2;1;Johnson to Miller, 1 run length on off again, no room again, all he manages is a single to deep cover;
37.1;?;Johnson to Miller, no run length ball, middle and off, 139ks, no room, defended to cover;
36.6;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run gets a bottom edge on this, the ball hasn't left the pitch, but Duminy calls him through for a stolen single;
36.5;?;Cummins to Miller, no run short of a length, not much room, can't beat point with this dab;
36.4;2;Cummins to Miller, 2 runs slower short ball, pulled square of deep square, comes back for two. A happy Sunday afternoon crowd is loving this;
36.3;4;Cummins to Miller, FOUR runs Miller is playing a blinder here. Length ball, outside off, uses every yard of Cummins's pace to beat third man who is back but a touch too wide;
36.2;1;Cummins to Duminy, 1 run short of a length, on pads, nudged away to bring up the 200 in the 37th over, which on a dry turner is a threatening score;
36.1;4lb;Cummins to Duminy, 4 leg byes another leg-side wide has been intercepted by the pads, but the deflection beats short fine leg to go to the fence;
35.6;2;Johnson to Miller, 2 runs yorker, middle and leg, squeezes it square, past short fine, comes back for two;
35.5;4lb;Johnson to Miller, 4 leg byes poor bowling, full, wide down the leg side, and had Miller's pads not deflected this, Haddin would have been tested to keep it under five wides;
35.4;4;Johnson to Miller, FOUR runs Miller is hurting Australia here. Short of a length, outside off, and he delays the shot, and delicately opens the face to beat short third man;
35.3;1;Johnson to Duminy, 1 run slower ball, 125ks, driven with an open face, hands over the strike;
35.2;1;Johnson to Miller, 1 run short of a length, outside off, punched to sweeper-cover for one;
35.1;4;Johnson to Miller, FOUR runs what a top shot, not so smart with the ball, though. He has a strong on-side field, and bowls a wide length ball. Smacked between cover and extra cover;
35.1;3w;Johnson to Miller, 3 wide and he bowls full and wide, well down the leg side, Haddin can't get there;
34.6;?;Cummins to Duminy, no run quick length ball, 144ks, no room, hits him high on the bat, comes back to him;
34.5;?;Cummins to Duminy, no run full, outside off, driven to mid-off;
34.4;?;Cummins to Duminy, no run slower short ball, doesn't bouncer high, Duminy knows nothing about it and stands and watches helplessly;
34.3;?;Cummins to Duminy, no run pushed straight to straight midwicket, sent back;
34.2;?;Cummins to Duminy, no run length ball, just outside off, hits the inside half of the bat;
34.1;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run length ball, on off, pushed with soft hands, gets a single before extra cover can intervene;
33.6;1;Smith to Miller, 1 run short, just outside off, cut away for a single;
33.5;1;Smith to Duminy, 1 run overpitched, on the pads, glanced away fine for a single;
33.4;1;Smith to Miller, 1 run this is short and wide, muscled to long-off for one;
33.3;?;Smith to Miller, no run he is pressing forward, Smith is keeping them just short of driving length. Defended back;
33.2;?;Smith to Miller, no run short of a length, on off, defended back to the bowler;
33.1;1;Smith to Duminy, 1 run short, outside off, punched down the ground for one;
32.6;?;Doherty to Miller, no run Shaun George's first big decision in ODIs has been challenged. He has given Miller lbw. This is angled away, pitching appreciably outside off, then turns against the angle, seems to me to have hit him outside the line. George has given it, though. Hot Spot deliberates over an inside edge even before we get to check the line of it. There is a faint small minuscule white mark on the inside edge. Shaun George stands corrected;
32.5;?;Doherty to Miller, no run length ball, on the pads, can't beat short fine leg;
32.4;1;Doherty to Duminy, 1 run flatter, he stays back, and places it wide of point;
32.3;?;Doherty to Duminy, no run tossed up outside off, comes down the track and kicks it away;
32.2;1;Doherty to Miller, 1 run waits for this to turn in, dabs it slightly wide of point for one;
32.1;?;Doherty to Miller, no run moves forward to defend this back to the bowler;
31.6;?;Smith to Duminy, no run this could be a googly, beats Duminy's toe end as he looks to cut;
31.5;?;Smith to Duminy, no run leaves the crease with defence on his mind, pushing it back to Smith;
31.4;4b;Smith to Duminy, 4 byes We have a mystery bowler on our hands. Duminy Haddin and Clarke, all beaten. Full ball, outside off, goes straight on. Duminy misses the sweep. Haddin misses the collection. Clarke doesn't have enough time to get to his right;
31.3;?;Smith to Duminy, no run short of a length, middle and leg, defended to leg;
31.2;1;Smith to Miller, 1 run short on middle and leg, pulled away for one;
31.1;6;Smith to Miller, SIX runs Miller counterattacks. The second ball he faces. Comes down the track, right to the pitch of the ball, and smashes it for a parallel six over long-off;
30.6;1;Doherty to Miller, 1 run moves across to the first ball he faces, sees it's short, stays back, and pushes it into the on side for a single;
30.5;W;Doherty to du Plessis, OUT he has walked past this one. This is superbly bowled. He jumps out of the crease again, Doherty gets a little bit of drift, a little of dip, which opens him up slightly. He is not close to the pitch now, and ends up feeling for the ball. It pitches one a length in front of leg, turns away, beats the bats and the stumps. Haddin does the rest;Faf du Plessis st ?Haddin b Doherty 12 (12m 20b 2x4 0x6) SR: 60;
30.4;?;Doherty to du Plessis, no run flatter, quicker, pushed back to the bowler;
30.3;?;Doherty to du Plessis, no run slower through the air, pushes forward and efends;
30.2;4;Doherty to du Plessis, FOUR runs slower through the air, du Plessis comes down the track, right down to the pitch, drives it inside-out, and this time he also manages to beat cover;
30.1;?;Doherty to du Plessis, no run quick, full, on the pads, defended;
29.6;1;Smith to du Plessis, 1 run turned around the corner for a single;
29.5;1;Smith to Duminy, 1 run low full toss, swept away;
29.4;?;Smith to Duminy, no run lovely googly, Duminy has no clue about it and pushes forward, but what seems an edge has come off the back pad;
29.3;1;Smith to du Plessis, 1 run full, on the pad, clipped away for an easy single square on the on side;
29.2;?;Smith to du Plessis, no run full, on the pads, flicked to midwicket;
29.1;1;Smith to Duminy, 1 run clipped off the pads for a single;
28.6;?;Doherty to du Plessis, no run quick on off, defended to cover;
28.5;?;Doherty to du Plessis, no run nearly gets him again, slows this one down, Faff looks to play it to leg, gets a soft leading edge that goes nowhere;
28.4;4;Doherty to du Plessis, FOUR runs more turn for Xman, this is flat and quick, takes the edge, and goes between keeper and slip. Fortunate runs;
28.3;?;Doherty to du Plessis, no run comes down the track, drives handsomely, can't beat cover;
28.2;?;Doherty to du Plessis, no run angled into the pads, defended to leg;
28.1;?;Doherty to du Plessis, no run defended to cover;
27.6;?;Smith to Duminy, no run tossed up outside off, holds its line, left alone;
27.5;?;Smith to Duminy, no run too full, hit back to the bowler;
27.4;1;Smith to du Plessis, 1 run charges at him and drives, Warner gets a bad bounce at cover;
27.3;?;Smith to du Plessis, no run flat, quick, no turn, hits the pad;
27.2;?;Smith to du Plessis, no run defended to cover;
27.1;?;Smith to du Plessis, no run defended solidly off the front foot;
26.6;?;Doherty to Duminy, no run tossed up outside off, presses forward to block it back to the bowler;
26.5;1;Doherty to du Plessis, 1 run forces this square on the off side, past point, gets a single;
26.4;?;Doherty to du Plessis, no run full, on the pads, defended to leg;
26.3;W;Doherty to Kallis, 1 run, OUT more misjudgement from South Africa. After G Smith's too-cute-by-half reverse-sweep, Kallis has run himself out trying a cute second. Tries the paddle sweep, the top edge clears the keeper, but has hardly crossed the 30-yard circle. Clarke from slip runs back and fields and hits the stumps direct. So far short is Kallis he might have been out had Haddin to collect and remove the bails;Jacques Kallis run out (Clarke) 76 (118m 88b 7x4 2x6) SR: 86.36;
26.2;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run short of a length, pushed to cover;
26.1;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run full, on off, defended off the front foot;
25.6;?;Smith to Duminy, no run flighted outside off, Duminy is well outside off to defend it to cover;
25.5;W;Smith to Smith, OUT Smith reviews this, Steven that is. Graeme has once again tried that cute reverse-sweep, misses, Haddin and Steven go up immediately. Umpire says no. Smith reviews immediately. The replays suggest a tiny little noise noise as the ball passes the glove, but there is no visual confirmation in normal replays. The Hot Spot, though, confirms a touch on the glove, and off goes Graeme;Graeme Smith c ?Haddin b Smith 57 (117m 69b 6x4 0x6) SR: 82.6;
25.4;1;Smith to Kallis, 1 run full, middle and leg, driven to long-on for one;
25.3;1;Smith to Smith, 1 run sweeps this square, all along the ground for one;
25.2;?;Smith to Smith, no run tries the reverse sweep outside off, beaten;
25.1;4b;Smith to Smith, 4 byes beaten first ball. Smith is drawn out to play a really full delivery, misses it, but it goes between Haddin's legs. Nearly a yorker for him, so only a half chance for the stumping;
24.6;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run full, on off, hit back to the bowler;
24.5;1;Doherty to Smith, 1 run swept away from well outside off, gets a single to long leg;
24.4;1;Doherty to Kallis, 1 run paddled away from well outside off, moves away from the strike. It should be easier for Smith to face the left-arm spinner, who will bring the ball into him;
24.3;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run short of a length, on off, stays back to defend;
24.2;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run even more turn, flat again, on off and middle, beats the drive, misses the off stump by inches. A slight puff of dust too;
24.1;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run more turn, this is flat too, pitches in front off and breaks away, beats the edge;
23.6;?;Bollinger to Smith, no run good yorker, 141ks, in front of off and middle, he digs it out well;
23.5;1;Bollinger to Kallis, 1 run punched away square for a single, Haddin shouts in the background, "One wicket boys";
23.4;1;Bollinger to Smith, 1 run this short ball chases him as he backs away, but he still manages a single to deep square;
23.3;4;Bollinger to Smith, FOUR runs that's his fourth boundary between mid-off and extra cover. This is an extraordinary innings from Smith. Leaves the crease, makes room, sends it crashing between the two men;
23.2;1;Bollinger to Kallis, 1 run short of a length, outside off, pushed wide of short midwicket;
23.1;?;Bollinger to Kallis, no run full and wide, driven straight to extra cover;
22.6;1;Doherty to Kallis, 1 run closes the face on this to take a single to square leg;
22.5;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run defended to cover this time;
22.4;4;Doherty to Kallis, FOUR runs this is slightly shorter, and grips and turns, but the outside edge beats both keeper and short third man;
22.3;6;Doherty to Kallis, SIX runs this has got nothing to do with the way the ball is bowled. Kallis seemed t have made his mind he would hit a six over midwicket this ball. And he does. Goes on a knee, sweeps in front of square, a fullish ball, goes for a parallel and big six;
22.2;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run driven on the up, to extra cover;
22.1;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run overpitched on off, pushed to cover;
21.6;1;Bollinger to Kallis, 1 run length ball, pushed to deepish mid-off for one;
21.5;?;Bollinger to Kallis, no run slower ball, outside off, looks to run it down, but early into the dab, bottom-edging it;
21.4;1;Bollinger to Smith, 1 run length ball outside off, crashes it to sweeper-cover to get to 50. He is feeling his way back to form, and the whole ground stands up and applauds. Smith takes time to acknowledge the support;
21.3;?;Bollinger to Smith, no run jumps out, across, outside off, the ball is even wider, and beats the outside edge again;
21.2;?;Bollinger to Smith, no run full and wide, holds its line, beats the outside edge. No feet here;
21.1;1;Bollinger to Kallis, 1 run full toss outside off, driven to long-off;
20.6;?;Doherty to Smith, no run tossed up outside off, closes the face on it, to midwicket;
20.5;3;Doherty to Kallis, 3 runs quicker, fuller, down the leg, Kallis is quick to paddle it delicately, past the keeper, to the right of fine leg;
20.4;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run more turn, but this time Kallis has it under control, guiding it to point;
20.3;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run flighted, middle and leg, turns, hits the edge, wide of keeper;
20.2;1;Doherty to Smith, 1 run flighted on off, guided into the leg side for a single;
20.1;?;Doherty to Smith, no run length on off, pushed to midwicket;
19.6;?;Johnson to Kallis, no run just short of a length, no room, Kallis again tries that third man single, but there is no room available;
19.5;1;Johnson to Smith, 1 run punched away to sweeper-cover for one;
19.4;1;Johnson to Kallis, 1 run short of a length, outside off, opens the face, takes the single;
19.3;1;Johnson to Smith, 1 run full, on the pads, picked away for a single;
19.2;2;Johnson to Smith, 2 runs full, on the pads, flicked away square, Smith makes another diving save to save two runs here;
19.1;?;Johnson to Smith, no run short of a length, on off, tries to run it fine, the slowness means he ends up hitting it to point;
18.6;1;Clarke to Smith, 1 run overpitched, on the pads, clipped away to deep midwicket;
18.6;1w;Clarke to Smith, 1 wide fires in a wide outside leg;
18.5;4;Watson to Smith, FOUR runs thick edge, Smith won't mind it. Watson hits the seam again, and there is extra bounce as Smith looks to cut. The edge flies fine, and Watson is down on his haunches. Century partnership up;
18.4;1;Watson to Kallis, 1 run this is taken from inside Haddin's gloves, runs it fine to third man for another single;
18.3;1;Watson to Smith, 1 run and dabs this square for a single;
18.2;4;Watson to Smith, FOUR runs that's some shot for somebody as bottom-handed as Smith. Jumps out of the crease, gives himself room, drives inside-out, between mid-off and extra cover;
18.1;1;Watson to Kallis, 1 run this one kicks off a length, hits the seam and jumps, hits the top six inches of the bat, outside off, and runs to third man;
17.6;1;Johnson to Kallis, 1 run runs this one behind square for a single;
17.5;?;Johnson to Kallis, no run short of a length, on off, cuts away, squares him up, defended to cover;
17.4;1;Johnson to Smith, 1 run slower ball, cutting into the pads, checks the shot well, takes a single wide of midwicket;
17.3;2;Johnson to Smith, 2 runs full, on the pads, whipped away square of deep square leg, where our man Steve Smith makes a diving save;
17.2;?;Johnson to Smith, no run length ball, outside off, defended with an open face;
17.1;1;Johnson to Kallis, 1 run dabs it down to third man for another single;
16.6;1;Watson to Kallis, 1 run Kallis smoothly moves to another fifty, picking this off the hip, taking a single to deep square. His 100th score of 50 or more in ODIs;
16.5;1;Watson to Smith, 1 run length ball on the pads, closes the face to take a single to deep square;
16.4;1;Watson to Kallis, 1 run runs this down off the face of the bat, gets a single to third man;
16.3;1;Watson to Smith, 1 run short of a length, wide, runs this down to third man for one;
16.2;1;Watson to Kallis, 1 run short of a length, doesn't come up, but he pulls it away to deep midwicket;
16.1;?;Watson to Kallis, no run length ball outside off, pushes with an open face, can't beat point;
15.6;1;Johnson to Kallis, 1 run driven to sweeper-cover for single. Amid all the chaos, Kallis serenely keeps scoring;
15.5;1lb;Johnson to Smith, 1 leg bye Johnson has missed a relatively easy run-out. This hits the pads, doesn't go far, Kallis wants the single, Smith doesn't start. Belatedly he goes. Johnson has enough time to lob the ball back but he goes for a direct hit. It's a wild throw, doesn't even land on the pitch;
15.4;1;Johnson to Kallis, 1 run clipped away to deep midwicket for a single;
15.3;1;Johnson to Smith, 1 run length ball, on off, driven to the right of mid-on, Smith almost runs into Johnson. He then moves away, but after completing the run he has a polite word and finger-pointing or two. The crowd loves it too;
15.2;1;Johnson to Kallis, 1 run clipped away off the pads;
15.1;1;Johnson to Smith, 1 run full, outside off, moves across and whips it past midwicket;
14.6;1;Doherty to Smith, 1 run clipped away off the pads, retains strike;
14.5;?;Doherty to Smith, no run pushed through, off and middle, stays back and defends;
14.4;1;Doherty to Kallis, 1 run pushed to sweeper-cover for one;
14.3;4;Doherty to Kallis, FOUR runs too full, Kallis opens up slightly and mercilessly sweeps this by the square leg umpire. Bisects the two deep men;
14.2;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run full again, defended back to the bowler;
14.1;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run turn now. Tossed up outside off, not overpitched, gives it time to turn, and that beats the edge;
13.6;?;Johnson to Smith, no run another whip from around off, and again finds short midwicket;
13.5;?;Johnson to Smith, no run wristily hit off a length, but can't beat short midwicket;
13.4;?;Johnson to Smith, no run tries the hook, early into it, gets a bottom edge onto the body;
13.3;1;Johnson to Kallis, 1 run worked away off the pads for a single;
13.2;?;Johnson to Kallis, no run huge shout for lbw, not given, and they have decided to not review it after a long deliberation. This did seem to hold its line so it could have been really close. It pitched on a length, hit Kallis in front, but the replays show only a quarter of the ball pitched inside the line of leg. That wouldn't have been reversed on the review;
13.1;?;Johnson to Kallis, no run full, on off, holds its line, gets an inside edge towards mid-on;
12.6;1;Doherty to Kallis, 1 run driven down to long-on for one;
12.5;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run beautiful shot as he takes this from outside leg to go inside-out, but Clarke makes a diving save at cover;
12.4;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run looks to cut, but the ball stops at him, ends up hitting it to cover;
12.3;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run slight drift with this one, but too full again. Pushed to short midwicket;
12.2;1;Doherty to Smith, 1 run length ball, just outside off, stays back to dab it fine of short third for a single;
12.1;1;Doherty to Kallis, 1 run full, middle and off, driven past Doherty for one;

Johnson comes back
 Innings Start
That's all we have tonight. Thanks for joining us, thanks for writing in. Cheers
Time for the presentation
Morne Morkel is the Man of the Match. He says, "Lot of work has gone in the last couple of days. Allan Donald and the whole bowling unit. Haven't changed much from last season. Just concentrated on the disciplines and basics. Special scalp, Clarke. He is a quality player. You can never count Dale out, will keep coming back in second and third spells. Lopsy has been working hard too, so big credit. Runs were always around the corner. I hope we can take the confidence from tonight. Really glad for the batting unit."
: "Our batting set the game. Graeme and Jacques set the game up, and David Miller and JO played fantastic knocks in the middle. The last game we lacked partnership, but this time the boys came out and proved what we are capable of. Always knew Graeme is an awesome player, was just a matter of time before he got us runs. We were joking earlier on about a 200 for no loss, but it's okay, it was 200 for 1. The bowlers responded superbly with their skills on this slow pitch. Durban will be a tad bit warmer, but looking forward to it."
Michael Clarke: "We were outplayed in all facets of the game. They showed how to bat on a slow track, they executed with the ball and even in the field they were much better. I am confident both Shane Watson and Shaun Marsh will be fine for the decider. Massive positive that Watto walked out to bat. The wicket was a little bit slower, but I don't think execute well."
A comprehensive win for South Africa. Fireworks go around at St George's Park. SA batted really well on this slow track, with fur men getting fifties. With Watson injured and two early wickets, it was always going to be tough. Hussey and Warner fought, but once they went it was all over, even though the inured Watson came out and hit a six and a four
49.6;W;Steyn to Doherty, OUT Bowled out off the last ball. Full toss outside off, drives with an open face, Duminy catches it at point, and hands it over to the leg umpire, who at the moment is at point because the left-hand batsman is on strike. Doherty's average takes a blow, he had a great chance of ending not-out;Xavier Doherty c Duminy b Steyn 10 (26m 20b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
49.5;?;Steyn to Doherty, no run length ball, outside off, pushed to cover;
49.4;1;Steyn to Cummins, 1 run bouncer, doesn't rise up, pulled away to deep square for one;
49.3;4;Steyn to Cummins, FOUR runs Lovely strike from Cummins for his first ODI boundary. It's a half-volley, driven between mid-off and extra cover;
49.2;?;Steyn to Cummins, no run beaten outside off;
49.1;2;Steyn to Cummins, 2 runs steered away from just outside off to Smith at third man, which is good new sin itself. He was off the field earlier with a stomach bug;
48.6;?;Duminy to Doherty, no run tries to make room and hit, but misses;
48.5;2;Duminy to Doherty, 2 runs slower through the air, tries to late-cut it, but it follows him, and he bottom-edges it between his legs;
48.4;2;Duminy to Doherty, 2 runs nicely driven inside-out, wide of long-off;
48.3;4b;Duminy to Doherty, 4 byes one more through Boucher, and it has mostly been the really full balls from the spinner, when the bat comes down at the same time as it pitches;
48.2;2;Duminy to Doherty, 2 runs full toss, laboriously hit over the head of short midwicket;
48.1;1;Duminy to Cummins, 1 run length ball, on the pads, worked away for a single;
47.6;1;Steyn to Cummins, 1 run on the pad, helped away for a single;
47.5;2;Steyn to Cummins, 2 runs off the short run, pushed to extra cover. That's first ODI run for Pat. And he gets an overthrow too. Life is easy;
47.4;?;Steyn to Cummins, no run length ball on off, pushed to cover;

47.2;?;Steyn to Doherty, no run slower length ball on the pads, defended to mid-off;
47.1;?;Steyn to Doherty, no run stays low, bounces well short of Boucher. Has been a tough night for the keepers;
46.6;W;Morkel to Bollinger, OUT Bollinger tries to hit, is early into this slower ball, short of a length outside off. All he manages is a lob to cover. Four-for for Morne. Just reward for wonderful bowling;Doug Bollinger c Duminy b Morkel 6 (8m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 120;
46.5;1;Morkel to Doherty, 1 run slower ball on off, pushes it to point for one, du Plessis tries the Rhodes-style run-out. Misses;

45.1;W;Steyn to Haddin, OUT du Plessis has been superb in the field, and provides a finishing touch here. Haddin lofts a length ball straight down, du Plessis runs to his left from long-on, and takes it head high. It was a flat and quick hit;Brad Haddin c du Plessis b Steyn 13 (45m 23b 0x4 0x6) SR: 56.52;
44.6;?;Morkel to Doherty, no run Doherty follows a length ball angling across him, fails to edge it;

38.6;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run length ball, on off, pushed to the bowler;
38.5;W;Morkel to Smith, OUT Smith will leave without a boundary to his name, thanks to a lovely catch from Duminy. And the lovely PE folk sing, "JP jou lekker ding" [The good thing]. Smith lofts this for what seems is six, Duminy sets himself up at the long-on fence, and takes an overhead catch while making sure he doesn't touch the rope;Steven Smith c Duminy b Morkel 26 (60m 39b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
38.4;1;Morkel to Haddin, 1 run short of a length, on off, tips and runs;

37.5;1;Tsotsobe to Haddin, 1 run this one stops at him, driven uppishly to mid-off;
37.4;3;Tsotsobe to Smith, 3 runs for an agonising little moment it seemed Smith had hit hi first boundary by walking across and flicking this past short fine. Botha, though, from deep square gives it a big chase, and throws itself at it to save one run;
37.3;1b;Tsotsobe to Haddin, 1 bye slower ball, a grubber, bounces well short of Boucher. They take a bye off the ricochet;
37.2;1;Tsotsobe to Smith, 1 run length ball, middle and off, pushed wide of cover for one;
37.1;1;Tsotsobe to Haddin, 1 run lofted straight, but can't beat long-on;

36.4;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run slower ball, full, driven to cover-point;

35.2;1;Tsotsobe to Smith, 1 run another slower ball, 116ks, hit uppishly, to the right of straight extra cover;
35.1;W;Tsotsobe to Watson, OUT and on cue Tsotsobe strikes, and that's the game. Slower ball, 118ks, on a length, middle and leg, Watson clears the front leg to go over cow corner, is early into the shot, and ends up dragging it straight to deep square. They all surround Lopsy;Shane Watson c Botha b Tsotsobe 15 (20m 10b 1x4 1x6) SR: 150;
34.6;?;Steyn to Smith, no run sees him back away, and slips in one wide of off. Beats a desperate attempt to get bat on it;
34.5;?;Steyn to Smith, no run short of a length, on off, no room, hit back to Steyn;
34.4;1;Steyn to Watson, 1 run watches Watson back away, follows him with a slower one, Watson flicks it to leg;
34.3;1;Steyn to Smith, 1 run slower ball, Smith does the thing to do, push it to long-on and hand it over to Watson;
34.2;1;Steyn to Watson, 1 run gets the yorker right this time, just the single;
34.1;2;Steyn to Watson, 2 runs Watson continues to look threatening, pulls this to cow corner. Duminy from long-on has to give it a big chase and a final lunge to keep them down to two;
33.6;?;Kallis to Smith, no run makes room to drive this square, can't beat backward point;
33.5;1;Kallis to Watson, 1 run slower ball, but too full to get under, so he drives it along the ground to long-on;
33.4;4;Kallis to Watson, FOUR runs Slower ball, Watson sees it early, Watson plants the big front foot down, and slogs this over midwicket. Now fun is coming;
33.3;6;Kallis to Watson, SIX runs Beware the wounded batsman lads. Kallis digs this in short, never mind that Watson is forward, he clubs this for a flat six over square leg;
33.2;1;Kallis to Smith, 1 run slow again, on off, this time he gets just the single to short fine;
33.1;2;Kallis to Smith, 2 runs slower ball on off, worked square on the on side with soft hands, comes back for two;

32.1;2;Steyn to Smith, 2 runs nicely opens the face on this quick length ball, to the left of third man;
31.6;?;Morkel to Watson, no run gets a full ball, which he drives back to Morkel, who has a mock throw at him;
31.5;1;Morkel to Smith, 1 run short, this is not nasty, and is pulled away to deep square for one;
31.4;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length, outside off, pushed to cover;
31.3;W;Morkel to Warner, OUT just too much pressure of the asking rate I suppose. And Morkel is not the bowler you can have your way with. This time the bounce gets a touch big, Warner's pull generates a hefty top edge, Boucher goes back towards short fine leg, and catches this swirling ball over his shoulder. Had to drag this pull from outside off;David Warner c ?Boucher b Morkel 74 (136m 97b 6x4 0x6) SR: 76.28;
31.2;2;Morkel to Warner, 2 runs slightly short, pulled wide of long-on, where Amla fields. They take the second, Morkel is not quite by the stumps to collect the throw. Would have been very close had he done so;
31.1;1;Morkel to Smith, 1 run short of a length, punched away to deep cover for one;
30.6;1;Botha to Smith, 1 run short of a length, goes with the arm, flicked from outside off for a single;
30.5;?;Botha to Smith, no run this one dips slightly on him, pushed to midwicket again;
30.4;?;Botha to Smith, no run flighted on middle and leg, pushed to midwicket;
30.3;1;Botha to Warner, 1 run this is angled in again, but has been pushed firmly and will bring him just the one;
30.2;2;Botha to Warner, 2 runs angling into the pads, played with soft hands, just a nudge into the on side, where all men are at the fence. Makes an easy couple to reach his ODI best;
30.1;1;Botha to Smith, 1 run straighter one outside off, pushed wide of cover for one;
29.6;2;Morkel to Warner, 2 runs length ball, thumped on the up, between long-on and long-off, gets a couple;
29.5;1;Morkel to Smith, 1 run breaks the maiden by pushing this lenght ball to the left of cover;
29.4;?;Morkel to Smith, no run half-forward to defend this time, to cover;
29.3;?;Morkel to Smith, no run Beaten again. This one holds its line again, Smith pushes at it. Makes no connection. Again bounces in front of Smith;
29.2;?;Morkel to Smith, no run that's a beaut from Morkel. Short of a length, outside off, holds its line, beats the edge, bounces in front of Boucher;
29.1;?;Morkel to Smith, no run starts off with a full ball outside off, defended to cover;
28.6;?;Botha to Warner, no run Botha belts out a big appeal after bowling the one that goes straight with the arm. The bat and pad are close together, there is bat involved for sure, but Botha appeals for pad first. Umpire George doesn't think so;
28.5;1;Botha to Smith, 1 run turns in towards the pad,s worked away for a single;
28.4;1;Botha to Warner, 1 run driven wide of cover for a single;
28.3;?;Botha to Warner, no run length ball on off, straighten, pushed with an open face;
28.2;2;Botha to Warner, 2 runs full, fired into the pads, Warner's bat comes down just in time, wide of deep midwicket, comes back for two;
28.1;?;Botha to Warner, no run slower through the air, gets turn from just outside off, beats the edge;
27.6;1;Duminy to Warner, 1 run this is angled into the pads, pushed wide of midwicket for one;
27.5;?;Duminy to Warner, no run length ball outside off, pushed tom cover, du Plessis doesn't allow anything there;
27.4;1lb;Duminy to Smith, 1 leg bye worked away off the pads, around the corner;
27.3;?;Duminy to Smith, no run full, on off, driven back to the bowler;
27.2;1;Duminy to Warner, 1 run worked to the right of short fine for one;
27.1;2;Duminy to Warner, 2 runs cut away in front of square, to the left of sweeper-cover for two;

26.3;1;Botha to Warner, 1 run fired into the pads, pushed wide of midwicket;
26.2;1;Botha to Smith, 1 run pushed square on the off side to get off the mark. Only 147 more, Steve;
26.1;1;Botha to Warner, 1 run flighted outside off, pushed to cover for one;
25.6;?;Duminy to Smith, no run fired across him, outside off, defended to leg;
25.5;W;Duminy to Hussey, OUT Hussey is gone. He has run himself out. Botha has had Hussey missed twice off his bowling, but this time his rocket arm gets rid of the man. Deflected fine off the pads, Hussey wants one, rightly sent back, and even though he has taken about four steps down the wicket, he can't make it bat. Comprehensively run out;Michael Hussey run out (Botha/?Boucher) 37 (83m 62b 4x4 0x6) SR: 59.67;
25.4;1;Duminy to Warner, 1 run driven to sweeper-cover for one;
25.3;?;Duminy to Warner, no run flighted outside off, driven to the right of cover where du Plessis makes a diving save;
25.2;?;Duminy to Warner, no run fired in full and straight, pushed back to Duminy;
25.1;?;Duminy to Warner, no run that's a grubber. Seems like a long hop. Warner wants to pull, but that has gone shin high to Boucher;
24.6;1;Botha to Warner, 1 run shortish, turns away after pitching off, turned into the on side for a single;
24.5;?;Botha to Warner, no run slower through the air, on middle and off, defended to cover;
24.4;2;Botha to Warner, 2 runs full, angling in, pushed wide of deep square, and they pinch the second;
24.3;1;Botha to Hussey, 1 run pushed past midwicket for one;
24.2;?;Botha to Hussey, no run that's a second stumping missed by Boucher. In fact it is an action replay of the earlier one. Hussey leaves the crease, the full ball passes between Hussey and the stumps. Boucher doesn't gather it. Missed on 18 and 36. Watch out when he is 54;
24.1;?;Botha to Hussey, no run short of a length, stays low, hit to cover;
23.6;1;Duminy to Hussey, 1 run short of a length, punched to deep point for one;
23.5;?;Duminy to Hussey, no run flighted on middle and leg, defended;

23.3;?;Duminy to Warner, no run hits this into his own pad;

18.3;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run slower ball now, fuller too, no room, defended to cover;
18.2;4;Kallis to Hussey, FOUR runs lovely late-cut. This is not to short, but he leans back and sends it crashing to the right of point and left of third man;
18.1;4;Kallis to Hussey, FOUR runs short-arm pull, crisp crunchy connection, over midwicket. After overs of trying to pull he finally gets one that is short enough, and lays into it;

15.3;1;Botha to Hussey, 1 run pushed to long-on for one;
15.2;?;Botha to Hussey, no run missed stumping. Sees him come down, fires it into the pads at 91ks, the ball squeezes between Hussey and leg stump, but it's too quick for Bouhcer, who is hit on the pad;
15.1;?;Botha to Hussey, no run arm ball again, on off, angling in, defended off the back foot;
14.6;1;Kallis to Hussey, 1 run this is quick, and he has run this down to third man for one;
14.5;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run slower ball, 118ks, tries to open the face, finds point;
14.4;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run more good work in the field. This time it's Duminy diving full length to his right at backward point. That's four saved because it was cut powerfully;
14.3;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run slower ball, full, driven to cover, and du Plessis gives Warner a scare with quick work. Warner, who has merely backed up, has to dive back;

11.2;?;Botha to Hussey, no run quick, on off, pushed to cover;
11.1;?;Botha to Hussey, no run no turn on the first ball, beats the inside edge, belts out an appeal. Even Boucher is not interested as this is going down leg;
10.6;?;Morkel to Warner, no run that's strange. I don't think I have ever seen this happen before. Bouncer down the leg side. Looks like a wide, but Warner pulls. Hits the back of the bat, lobs, and falls well short of slip;
10.5;1;Morkel to Hussey, 1 run bouncer, quick one, Hussey goes for the pull, mis-hits it down towards square leg;
10.4;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run on a length, on off, pushed with an open face;
10.3;4;Morkel to Hussey, FOUR runs lovely shot, he has been hitting straight to cover, but this time he waits an extra half second to make sure he beats the man to his right. It was a wide ball asking for it;
10.2;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run length ball, on off, driven with open face, straight to cover-point;
10.1;1lb;Morkel to Warner, 1 leg bye that;s quick, don't go by 141ks on the gun. Short of a lenght, beats Warner for pace, hits his thigh pad;
9.6;1;Tsotsobe to Warner, 1 run driven to midwicket, through his legs it goes. Been an over of sloppy fielding;
9.5;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run another slower ball driven uppishly, this falls well short of mid-off;
9.4;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run short of a length, punched down to mid-off;
9.3;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run anther length ball, no room, pushed back to Tsotsobe;
9.2;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run length ball, punched to cover;
9.1;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run Dropped. A sitter too. Slower ball again, hit loopily to Amal at mid-on. Chest-high. He grabs at in front of his body. Spilled. Lonwabo can't even swear. It's the captain;
8.6;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run length ball, on off, pushed to cover, belts out a call of no;
8.5;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run short of a length, on off, pushed to cover;
8.4;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run this is real full, near-yorker, dug out to mid-on;
8.3;4;Morkel to Hussey, FOUR runs the rare loose ball from Morne, a wide half-volley, and Hussey deals with it with a square drive, to the right of cover;

8.1;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run mistimes a pull from outside off;
7.6;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run length ball outside off, driven powerfully, to mid-off;
7.5;1;Tsotsobe to Hussey, 1 run cut away hard, falls a few yards short of third man;
7.4;1;Tsotsobe to Warner, 1 run slower ball, nearly caught. Warner attacks it, hits uppishly towards mid-on, Amla takes a couple of steps in, but it bounces well in front of him. However, he manages to get his sliding body behind it, and concedes just one;
7.3;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run length ball, outside off, pushed back to Tsotsobe;
7.2;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run short of a length, outside off, punched square to point;
7.1;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run Reviewed. Boucher has initiated this. And this seems like a good call to me. I heard a woody sound as the ball passed down the leg sound. Boucher heard that too, and convinced Amla to go for it. Replays, though, show it hit the pad, and was nowhere near the bat. However, the sound was woody;
6.6;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run good bouncer, 140ks, around middle and off, seams away a touch, Hussey shapes up for the pull, and then pulls out;
6.5;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run short of a length, middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler;

6.2;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run length ball, on off, defended back to the bowler;
6.1;W;Morkel to Clarke, OUT Morne Morkel bowls a beauty. They say hit the top of off, Morne bowls just by top of off. You can't do much more than defend these balls. Clarke plays for the angle, but misjudges the angle and gets the edge. Graeme Smith's bucket hands at first slip do the rest;Michael Clarke c Smith b Morkel 1 (10m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
5.6;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run short of a length, no room, defended to cover;
5.5;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run half-volley on off, drilled down the ground, can't beat mid-off;
5.4;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run some late swing there, nearly beats the inside edge, but it is that very edge that saves him from an lbw call;
5.3;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run slower ball, 122ks, short of a length, on off, defended to short cover;
5.2;1;Tsotsobe to Clarke, 1 run not in control of this pull shot, but manages to hit it wide of mid-on;
5.1;?;Tsotsobe to Clarke, no run short of a length, around off, pushed to cover;
4.6;?;Morkel to Warner, no run another length ball, sharp at 144ks, hit to mid-on, off the inside half of the bat;
4.5;?;Morkel to Warner, no run length ball, crisply driven down the ground, but you can't escape the long limbs of Morne;
4.4;1lb;Morkel to Clarke, 1 leg bye short again, worked away off the hip for a single;
4.3;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run dangerous leave, on height as much as line. Short of a length, close to off, Clarke shoulders arms. The balls stays low, and nips back in. Misses the stumps;
4.2;1;Morkel to Warner, 1 run pushed wide of mid-on for one;
4.1;?;Morkel to Warner, no run digs this one in, the ball doesn't come on, defended;
3.6;?;Tsotsobe to Clarke, no run shortish outside off, skids through low, Clarke is beaten on the cut;
3.5;W;Tsotsobe to Ponting, OUT du Plessis is claiming a low catch at cover-point. Ponting is not moving. This is short, angling away, game for cut, but the tennis-ball bounce means it comes slower and higher. Ponting ends up hitting uppishly and in front of square. Replays show he has been taken. Clean as a whistel, low in front of him;Ricky Ponting c du Plessis b Tsotsobe 10 (17m 7b 2x4 0x6) SR: 142.85;
3.4;1;Tsotsobe to Warner, 1 run full, on the pads, driven wide of mid-on for one;
3.3;?;Tsotsobe to Warner, no run this time he defends to point;
3.2;4;Tsotsobe to Warner, FOUR runs Does this bat have springs? He leans into this length ball and defends with an open face. And it goes blazing across between cover and cover-point;
3.1;1;Tsotsobe to Ponting, 1 run length ball, pushed to mid-off with soft hands;
2.6;?;Steyn to Warner, no run Warner shapes up for the pull, but decides this is slightly too full for the pull. Punches this to mid-on;
2.5;?;Steyn to Warner, no run slower ball again, 123ks, hit to short cover this time;
2.4;4;Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs slower ball, he is early into the shot, but manages to get it over point. Tsotsobe runs around from third man and puts the dive in, but can't stop four;
2.3;4;Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs Pummelled. Brutal. This fast and short, and Warner loves them. It comes at 145ks, and is pulled at an immeasurably quicker pace;
2.2;4;Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs slower ball, 122ks, still it flies off the bat. He just meets it with an open face, and extreme speed has been generated on the ball. It goes between cover and extra cover;
2.1;?;Steyn to Warner, no run crisply driven square, but can't beat Duminy at point;
1.6;4;Tsotsobe to Ponting, FOUR runs lovely straight punch. Ponting looks threatening. Gets the big stride in, meets this length under his eye, and push-drives it to the left of the bowler and right of mid-off;
1.5;1;Tsotsobe to Warner, 1 run full, on the pads, clipped away for a single;
1.4;1;Tsotsobe to Ponting, 1 run short of a length, punched away square past point;
1.3;4;Tsotsobe to Ponting, FOUR runs short at 128ks. Ponting of the old would have sent this into the Indian Ocean. Ponting of the new pulls it over midwicket for four;
1.2;?;Tsotsobe to Ponting, no run gets behind the line this time, punches it to cover;
1.1;?;Tsotsobe to Ponting, no run short of a length, angled across, stays low, squeezes under the bat;
0.6;?;Steyn to Warner, no run another slower ball, 122ks, closes the face on this, but can't beat the diving square leg;
0.5;?;Steyn to Warner, no run length ball, on off, stays on the crease, defends;
0.4;?;Steyn to Warner, no run slower ball, 125ks, on leg, Warner checks the shot, and defends to midwicket;
0.3;?;Steyn to Warner, no run outswinger, 138ks, on off, pushed back to Steyn, who wants to have a mock throw, but doesn't field cleanly;
0.2;4;Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs short of a length, on the pads, gently nudged away, but superbly timed, square of fine leg;
0.1;2;Steyn to Warner, 2 runs length ball, on off, crisply push-driven, past cover, gets a couple;

Back for the chase. Ponting and Warner to open. No Watson in sight. No word on him. "New ICC rules say that no runners are allowed. I'd imagine wont bat... if he does, it'll be below Steve Smith, who'll score 148*." Darren has proved I am not the only one insane. Here is Steyn
