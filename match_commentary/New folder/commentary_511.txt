So, a valuable late contribution from Bollinger, who helped Hussey add 31 for the last wicket. Will 253 be a par score? It might well be, if Australia use the conditions with anything like the same skill. Don't go away, unless it's to boil the kettle. We're all for that sort of behaviour.
"Andrew!" exclaims Ali Shah. "You being unfair! It cant be Sydney! Kamran didnt drop any and Afridi is not as defensive as Yousuf." Very fair point, Ali, Pakistan played mighty well in this first innings. But Hussey's half-century could still prove crucial.
"What is the weather like today?," asks Iain who is stuck in rainy Scotland. "A bowling day or a batting day?" Well, it's brighter than yesterday but I reckon there'll be movement for the Aussie new-ball attack as well.
A real test for a young Pakistan batting line-up, which features two debutants in Umar Amin and Azhar Ali - about whom Andy Zaltzman has written in his latest Confectionary Stall blog. Read it at once, I implore you.

70.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Hussey, no run full outside off, a hint of swing back into the left hander and it's left alone;
70.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Hussey, no run outside off, a gentle loosener to start with, and left alone;

68.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Bollinger, no run shoved outside off stump, Bollinger leaves alone imperiously;
67.6;?;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, no run slightly quicker from Kaneria, Hussey gets everything behind a block and Bollinger will have to face the next over;
67.5;?;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, no run strangely, there are still fielders set deep, giving Hussey one at this stage, but the delivery is good and Hussey can only come forward and defend back to the bowler;

66.5;?;Amir to Bollinger, no run Bollinger does this well, it's full and he digs it out solidly;
66.4;1;Amir to Hussey, 1 run this time he gets this single, pushing to deep midwicket, so Aamer will have two deliveries to finish this off;

65.4;1;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, 1 run oops, Hussey pushes into the leg side and sets off for two, but crashes into the generous figure of Bollinger as he runs the first one, so can only take a single;
65.3;?;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, no run good ball this, pushed across Hussey finds an edge that runs past slip for a couple;

62.2;?;Amir to Hussey, no run back on to a line and length now, Hussey defends;
62.1;4;Amir to Hussey, FOUR runs while Hussey is still standing Australia will always be fighting, this was a bit of a grim half-tracker from Aamer and Hussey made no mistake, taking full advantage to crash it firmly through straight midwicket;
61.6;W;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, OUT lovely bowling! Really good to watch! The pressure built all over, Johnson had no idea what was going on, this was looped up outside off, Johnson aimed an airy drive and it spun back quickly through the gate on to the stumps;Mitchell Johnson b Danish Kaneria 3 (12m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;

61.3;?;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, no run left alone again outside off, this is a googly though;

60.3;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run Gul getting the ball to move around still, jagging this back into Hussey's pads;
60.3;1nb;Umar Gul to Hussey, (no ball) another no ball ruins what would have been a good bouncer, forcing Hussey to sway away swiftly;
60.2;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run the wicket might just have given Gul some confidence, he's really bounding in, finds some extra bounce and hurries Hussey into a defence;
60.1;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run good from Gul, full and attacking the stumps, Hussey forward and defending uneasily. Pakistan have to get him out, not gift him singles. It will be a low scoring game and Hussey can make a big difference;
59.6;?;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, no run fired down the leg side to finish the over, Akmal collects smartly and rewards himself by whipping off the bails;
59.5;1;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, 1 run Hussey is very confident driving to the covers, but Afridi is adopting the horrible tactic of gifting him singles with a deep-set field. Bad at the best of times and unforgivable off the fifth delivery;
59.4;?;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, no run thrown up outside off stump to Hussey, who stretches forward to block towards point;
59.3;3;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, 3 runs very nicely flighted by Kaneria, looking to tease a big shot out of Johnson, but the batsman instead leant it through midwicket very comfortably, collecting three;
59.2;?;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, no run Johnson gets a googly first up, didn't read it by the looks of things but left alone;
59.1;W;Danish Kaneria to Smith, OUT And Kaneria wins the battle straight away! Pitched in line, it was a topspinner that squeezed between bat and pad, stuck in front, but replays show Smith got a faint inside edge, so he's unlucky. Big wicket that!;Steven Smith lbw b Danish Kaneria 1 (5m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;
58.6;1;Umar Gul to Smith, 1 run Smith is away, working this to midwicket and scampering through for a single;
58.5;?;Umar Gul to Smith, no run well judged by Smith, who looks confident enough leaving alone;
58.4;?;Umar Gul to Smith, no run gets the line right, perhaps it's a touch too short though and Smith gets behind a solid defence;
58.3;?;Umar Gul to Smith, no run this was a touch wide again, but not as wide as Gul's smile after he saw this bend away late, big reverse swing, which might keep things interesting;
58.2;?;Umar Gul to Smith, no run this is better, in the sense that it was a legal delivery, but worse in terms of line, giving Smith an early chance to leave alone outside off;
58.2;1nb;Umar Gul to Smith, (no ball) gets another no ball from Gul first up, apart from that it was a good delivery, yorker that Smith just jabbed a bat down in time on;
58.1;W;Umar Gul to Paine, OUT gets this right though! Gul finally joins the paceman's party and Paine's tough debut innings is over! It was a touch quicker and it bounced a fraction more on Paine, moving away and clipping the outside edge through to Akmal, who made no mistake;Tim Paine c ?Kamran Akmal b Umar Gul 7 (55m 46b 1x4 0x6) SR: 15.21;
58.1;1nb;Umar Gul to Paine, (no ball) Gul gets things going after the break with an enormous no ball, not very smart that;
57.6;?;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, no run plays back and defended into the covers;
57.5;4;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, FOUR runs back to back boundaries, wide outside off and Hussey slots a perfect drive between cover and mid-off;
57.4;6;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, SIX runs slog sweep, fetched from outside off and launches it over deep midwicket...that was more akin to his Twenty20 innings in St Lucia;
57.3;1;Danish Kaneria to Paine, 1 run tossed up on off stump, driven to mid-off and that's a lazy single for Pakistan to give away;
57.2;1;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, 1 run waits on the back foot and works out to deep square;
57.1;?;Danish Kaneria to Hussey, no run edged, but doesn't carry to slip. Outside off and Hussey pushed forward but not quite hard enough for it to reach the fielder;
56.6;?;Umar Gul to Paine, no run good ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler;
56.5;?;Umar Gul to Paine, no run misses out on a boundary here as he clips a leg-stump half volley, but it goes straight to midwicket...Paine can't break free;
56.4;?;Umar Gul to Paine, no run back of a length outside off, defended into the covers;
56.3;?;Umar Gul to Paine, no run big appeal for lbw as Gul fires in a full delivery but it's going down the leg side;
56.2;1;Umar Gul to Hussey, 1 run much fuller and Hussey drives down towards mid-on...there's a direct hit but Paine has made his ground very easily;
56.1;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run outside off and it carries nicely through to Akmal at waist height;

55.4;?;Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run comes onto the front foot and defends into the covers;
55.3;?;Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run straighter ball, Paine plays into the leg side off the back foot;
55.2;?;Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run touch short and cut away to backward point;
55.1;?;Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run nicely bowled on off stump, hint of turn as Paine defends square on the off side;
54.6;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run dragged down short outside but Hussey doesn't time his cut and it is toe-ended into the covers;
54.5;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run on the stumps this time and worked out to midwicket...was a slightly fuller length, too, which is better;
54.4;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run pushed across the left hander and it's another leave;
54.3;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run too wide again from Gul, he hasn't made Hussey play yet in this over;
54.2;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run full outside off, shoulders arms again;
54.1;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run outside off and left alone;
53.6;?;Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run Nearly! Paine almost chips a return catch off a very full delivery, he scooped it towards Kaneria but it landed about a foot short of him;

52.4;?;Mohammad Asif to Hussey, no run good carry outside off, Hussey shoulders arms and Akmal takes above his head;

52.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Hussey, no run full and wide of off stump, Hussey comes forward then leaves it alone;

51.2;?;Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run turned in the air this time, but no one is catching at midwicket;
51.1;?;Danish Kaneria to Paine, no run on leg stump, flicked down to mid-on;
50.6;4;Mohammad Asif to Hussey, FOUR runs touch too straight, Hussey picks him off through midwicket for a welcome boundary...Asif angry with himself, but we'll allow him that loose ball after this spell;

48.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run lovely shape, outside off and curves away from Paine who watches it well and leaves alone;
47.6;?;Amir to Hussey, no run another wild delivery down the leg side and Akmal does well to dive across...probably Aamer's worst over of the day;
47.5;?;Amir to Hussey, no run down the leg side, very wayward and he seems to striving a touch too hard at the moment;

45.6;1;Amir to Paine, 1 run blimey, he was late on that, he swung sharp and late and Paine jabbed down on it...Hussey calls him through for a quick run - his first in Test cricket - as short leg tries to flick the ball back onto the stumps;
45.6;1w;Amir to Paine, 1 wide that comes out all wrong, sprayed well wide of off stump and he'll have to bowl that one again;

44.5;?;Mohammad Asif to North, no run more movement, this time takes the inside edge into the leg side...nearly beat the stroke again;
44.4;?;Mohammad Asif to North, no run ooh, late movement from a full length and that almost took pad first which would have been plumb lbw. Well, replays show it was pad first but the appeal was very muted;
44.3;W;Mohammad Asif to Katich, OUT gone! Asif gets another and it's a massive wicket. On off stump and late movement away from Katich which took the outside edge through to Kamran Akmal. A cracking ball. The previous one came back in, this one shaped away.;Simon Katich c ?Kamran Akmal b Mohammad Asif 80 (206m 138b 9x4 0x6) SR: 57.97;
44.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run well bowled, nips back off the seam from a good length and takes Katich high on the pads;
44.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run outside off and left alone;
43.6;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run pushed down the leg side and the angle from round the wicket takes it further;
43.5;?;Umar Gul to Hussey, no run outside off and left alone;
43.4;1;Umar Gul to Katich, 1 run round the wicket, worked from off stump into midwicket;
43.3;2;Umar Gul to Katich, 2 runs gets a leading edge on a drive which nearly goes back to Gul, but beats the out-stretched hand and beats mid-off down the ground;
43.2;?;Umar Gul to Katich, no run outside off, keeps a fraction low and Katich stabs it into the covers;
43.1;?;Umar Gul to Katich, no run full outside off stump, leans into a well-timed drive but mid-off makes a good save;
42.6;W;Mohammad Asif to Clarke, OUT Asif strikes! The last ball before tea, and Pakistan really needed this! It was a touch fuller, pitched in line and jagged back down the slope, Clarke was beaten by the movement as he tried to defend and this time umpire Gould gives the decision. Touch unlucky for Clarke, replays show it sliding down the leg side.;Michael Clarke lbw b Mohammad Asif 47 (110m 77b 8x4 0x6) SR: 61.03;
42.5;?;Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run that's a better length, but it's too far outside off stump to draw a shot from Clarke;
42.4;?;Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run Clarke this time opts to defend, and does so very certainly, Asif is bowling a fraction short, which is unlike him;
42.3;?;Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run big movement here from Asif, snaking away late, but Clarke is seeing it well and leaving alone;
42.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run what a good delivery this is! Absolutely cuts Clarke in half. The batsman came forward to defend it jagged back straight through him and over the top of the stumps;
42.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run Asif again finds the line just outside off stump, Clarke happily leaves alone;
41.6;2;Afridi to Katich, 2 runs shoved full and down the leg side, Katich gloves a sweep shot down to fine leg for two more. Captain under pressure;
41.5;4;Afridi to Katich, FOUR runs eep, very ugly stuff from Afridi, very very short and wide outside off stump, Katich clumps it through cover for four;
41.4;1;Afridi to Clarke, 1 run Afridi can't quite maintain a decent length it seems, this is short and Clarke is back in a flash and cutting to deep point;
41.3;?;Afridi to Clarke, no run Clarke skips up the wicket and defends;
41.2;?;Afridi to Clarke, no run Clarke forward and defending, better from Afridi;
41.1;1;Afridi to Katich, 1 run Afridi continues, and this is slightly better than how he started the last over, on leg stump and tickled round the corner;
40.6;?;Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run outside off stump this time, moving away a fraction and left alone;
40.5;2;Mohammad Asif to Clarke, 2 runs Asif is suckered into cricket's age-old rule, where there is movement outside off, but never from leg stump, all of which means Clarke nudges a couple through square leg;
40.4;?;Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run high quality leave this, it pitched on off stump, and moved away and Clarke left alone;
40.3;?;Mohammad Asif to Clarke, no run Pakistan might need to do this for a while, just try and stem the flow of runs, outside off stump, moving away a fraction and Clarke leaves alone;
40.2;3;Mohammad Asif to Katich, 3 runs neatly done from Katich, didn't try to over-hit the ball, just pushed his hands through the line outside off and collected a three through cover;
40.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run almost had it here, Asif finds some life off the pitch, moving it back into Katich and striking the pad via the inside edge;
39.6;1;Afridi to Katich, 1 run single to finish an expensive over, worked into the leg side;
39.5;4;Afridi to Katich, FOUR runs oh dear, this is hideous. Very very short, Katich clubs it in front of midwicket for another boundary. I wouldn't want to be the fielder at short leg if Afridi is bowling like this;
39.4;2;Afridi to Katich, 2 runs too short again from Afridi, and cut firmly towards the cover boundary;
39.3;?;Afridi to Katich, no run touch outside off and Katich happy to block;
39.2;?;Afridi to Katich, no run this is better, fuller and on off stump and defended;
39.1;4;Afridi to Katich, FOUR runs not a great start at all from the captain, horrid ball dragged very short, Katich gets back and helps himself to four more, pulling through midwicket to bring up the 100 stand;
38.6;?;Amir to Clarke, no run this time it doesn't move away from the right hander and carries on with the angle and down the slope, Clarke though has his eye in and leaves alone;
38.5;?;Amir to Clarke, no run Aamer looks happier against Clarke, seaming it up the slope as Clarke leaves alone;
38.4;1;Amir to Katich, 1 run ooh, a touch airy here from Katich, it was dropped a little shorter from Aamer and Katich half pulled half shovelled it, off the top edge wide of fine leg for two more;
38.3;?;Amir to Katich, no run this time it's defended outside off stump;
38.2;4;Amir to Katich, FOUR runs four more, this is classic Katich. Vintage Katich you could say, crabbing across to off stump and clipping through midwicket for four;
38.1;4;Amir to Katich, FOUR runs 50 for Katich, the 9th consecutive Test he's reached that mark, this was probably his least convincing stroke though, jabbing outside off stump, went in the air but into a space through point for four;
37.6;?;Danish Kaneria to Clarke, no run Clarke reaches for the textbook and produces a picture-perfect forward defence;
37.5;3;Danish Kaneria to Katich, 3 runs too short from Kaneria, Katich hops back and drags him down to fine leg, Kaneria leaking runs;
37.4;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run Katich almost down the track a fraction and defending;
37.3;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run having taken the boundary he is happy to stretch forward and defend;
37.2;4;Danish Kaneria to Katich, FOUR runs good work from Katich, he's so stealthy in his progress, works this very easily through midwicket for four;
37.1;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run Kaneria finds a decent length and line outside off, Katich defends;
36.6;4;Amir to Clarke, FOUR runs top batting! What a little battle this is becoming, having had the worse of the first five ball, Clarke drives this crispy and firmly through mid off for four;
36.5;?;Amir to Clarke, no run good leave from Clarke, really well judged outside off stump, moving away a fraction;
36.4;?;Amir to Clarke, no run beaten this time! Lovely bowling, just moving away off the wicket and zipping past the outside edge. If you were going to be super critical of Aamer, and he's already of the quality where you should be, it was a touch short;
36.3;?;Amir to Clarke, no run Clarke has a dart at this, just outside off stump, it skews off the inside half of the bat;
36.2;?;Amir to Clarke, no run this time Clarke plays, and a good job he did, defending solidly;
36.1;?;Amir to Clarke, no run the Clarke - Aamer battle continues and this almost undid the batsman! It came back at him from round the wicket, Clarke left alone and looked alarmed as the ball honed in and bounced just over the stumps;
35.6;3;Danish Kaneria to Clarke, 3 runs lovely stuff from Clarke, edging up the wicket and turning his wrists over the ball to send it to square leg for three, Kaneria can't quite keep the lid on things here;
35.5;1;Danish Kaneria to Katich, 1 run once again Katich lures a bowler into attacking his legs, and once again he clips it quietly to fine leg;
35.4;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run looped up a touch outside off and Katich bunts it to mid on;
35.3;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run good from Kaneria, finding a length and line outside off, and Katich defends;
35.2;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run this time Katich is more secure, defending quietly into the off side;
35.1;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run oooh, close call here! For no good reason, Katich misses one of his routine leg-side clips, but it hits him a touch high and outside off;
34.6;?;Amir to Clarke, no run interesting over. Slightly straighter, forcing Clarke to play, which he does very solidly, blocking towards cover;
34.5;?;Amir to Clarke, no run good contest this, having been beaten last ball Clarke reverts to leaving outside off stump;
34.4;?;Amir to Clarke, no run this time Clarke does drive and is beaten! Held outside off on a length, Clarke wafted at it and it ghosted past the edge;
34.3;?;Amir to Clarke, no run touch of extra bounce, Aamer holding his line quite far outside off, trying to attract the flashing drive from Clarke, but he has none of it, leaving all alone;
34.2;?;Amir to Clarke, no run Aamer's response is to aim it much wider of off stump, Clarke shoulders arms;
34.1;2;Amir to Clarke, 2 runs Clarke very comfortable here, using the angle from round the wicket to work it to square leg for a swiftly-taken couple. He looks in good order today;

"Clarke has a better strike rate than when he usually plays T20!" notes Mick. And he isn't the only one to say that.
 Innings Start
So Australia earn themselves a sizeable lead of 105 and Pakistan couldn't even bat the length of a one-day innings. Pretty disappointing effort from them, apart from Salman Butt, although the top order is quite inexperienced. Watson was good, he found some swing both ways, but the tone was set by Ben Hilfenhaus with the new ball. Watson will now be getting his batting gear on as he and Simon Katich start to build on this lead.
40.5;W;Watson to Danish Kaneria, OUT gone! Watson's done it. Five wickets for him as Kaneria gets a thick edge to a very full delivery as he drives and Steven Smith grabs the catch at third slip;Danish Kaneria c Smith b Watson 14 (22m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 70;
40.4;?;Watson to Danish Kaneria, no run another one shapes away outside off and Kaneria nearly nibbles at it;
40.3;?;Watson to Danish Kaneria, no run touch too wide outside off and Kaneria doesn't need to play;
40.2;?;Watson to Danish Kaneria, no run full on middle stump and defended down to mid-off;
40.1;?;Watson to Danish Kaneria, no run outside off, swinging away and Kaneria pulls his bat inside the line;
39.6;?;Johnson to Mohammad Asif, no run back of a length and fended into the off side...that completes the over broken by the rain;
39.5;?;Johnson to Mohammad Asif, no run excellent yorker and well dug out;
39.4;4;Johnson to Mohammad Asif, FOUR runs starts to back away outside leg but manages to make contact and guide it through the packed slip cordon down to third man...he exposed all three stumps;
39.3;1;Johnson to Danish Kaneria, 1 run banged in short, he goes for a huge heave over the leg side but gets a top edge down to third man...there is a fielder there, but it falls short of him;
39.2;2;Johnson to Danish Kaneria, 2 runs worked neatly off middle stump out towards deep square...long leg runs around to do the fielding;
39.1;?;Johnson to Danish Kaneria, no run full outside off, Kaneria feels for it without any footwork;
38.6;?;Watson to Mohammad Asif, no run way wide of the off stump and left alone...almost wide enough to be called;
38.5;?;Watson to Mohammad Asif, no run ooh, play and miss. Was there a sound? Nope, no contact;
38.4;?;Watson to Mohammad Asif, no run nearly gets through with an inswinger to Asif, but he jabs down on it in time and edges it wide of the stumps;
38.3;1;Watson to Danish Kaneria, 1 run flicked away through square leg;
38.2;?;Watson to Danish Kaneria, no run on middle and blocked very correctly towards mid-off;
38.1;?;Watson to Danish Kaneria, no run on leg stump, defended down to mid-on;
37.6;3;Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, 3 runs flicked past short leg and they managed to make it into three despite these two not being great runners;
37.5;?;Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, no run defended square on the off side;
37.4;?;Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, no run feels for this outside off and is beat...ball doesn't carry to Paine;
37.3;?;Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, no run another short ball and Kaneria was backing away almost before he let it go...doesn't make contact with his attempted slash;
37.2;4;Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, FOUR runs backs away and has a huge heave at this which flies over the slips and down to third man;
37.1;?;Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, no run driven firmly to mid-off;
36.6;W;Watson to Salman Butt, OUT gone! Another for Watson and a lovely piece of bowling as he slips a fully delivery through an attempted drive. Late swing defeated the shot, it was almost a yorker, and Watson now has four;Salman Butt b Watson 63 (169m 94b 12x4 0x6) SR: 67.02;
36.5;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run more swing takes the inside edge as Butt drives;
36.4;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run outside off and left alone;
36.3;3;Watson to Danish Kaneria, 3 runs finds the outside edge, squared up but it goes along the ground between third slip and gully;
36.2;1;Watson to Salman Butt, 1 run pushed square through the off side, Butt thought he might get two but has to settle for a single as he hit it too well so Kaneria is exposed;
36.1;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run on off stump, hint of shape back into the left hander, and defended towards mid-off who is quite deep;
35.6;?;Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, no run hops into line and defends to the on side;
35.5;?;Bollinger to Danish Kaneria, no run stays round the wicket, full outside off and squeezed square on the off side...there's almost a mix-up as he wants a single;
35.4;W;Bollinger to Umar Gul, OUT gone! Simple as you like, the change of line works as Gul fends outside off and sends an easy catch to first slip...the angle confused him and he wasn't sure what to play and what to leave;Umar Gul c Watson b Bollinger 7 (19m 20b 1x4 0x6) SR: 35;
35.3;?;Bollinger to Umar Gul, no run back of a length, pushed out towards point;
35.2;?;Bollinger to Umar Gul, no run stands tall and defends into the off side;
35.1;?;Bollinger to Umar Gul, no run bouncer over off stump and Gul ducks down below it;
34.6;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run full on off stump, defended to the off side;
34.5;1;Watson to Umar Gul, 1 run sends down the in-dipper but Gul is equal to it and works a single down to long leg;
34.4;?;Watson to Umar Gul, no run goes to leave this but gets the bottom of the bat into the ground which sends the ball towards gully;
34.3;?;Watson to Umar Gul, no run touch fuller this time on off stump, defended towards mid-off;
34.2;?;Watson to Umar Gul, no run back outside off stump, hint of movement away and defended to point;
34.1;?;Watson to Umar Gul, no run pushed down the leg side;
33.6;1;Bollinger to Umar Gul, 1 run full on off stump, pushed in the air wide of cover but Australia won't mind that he keeps the strike;
33.5;?;Bollinger to Umar Gul, no run nearly plays on again! Gets an inside edge as he defends high and the ball dribbles between his legs but misses leg stump;
33.4;?;Bollinger to Umar Gul, no run squared up on middle stump, gets an outside edge along the ground to cover;
33.3;?;Bollinger to Umar Gul, no run good line outside off going across Gul who shoulders arms;
33.2;1;Bollinger to Salman Butt, 1 run comes half forward and gets a thick inside edge into the leg side;
33.1;4;Bollinger to Salman Butt, FOUR runs meanwhile Butt plays another perfect cover drive, overpitched from Bollinger on off stump and the left hander leans on it through mid-off;
32.6;4;Watson to Umar Gul, FOUR runs edged! Wide of second slip and could have been swallowed by third as Gul drives away from his body;
32.5;?;Watson to Umar Gul, no run defended into the covers;
32.4;?;Watson to Umar Gul, no run ooh, another inswinger from Watson and gets Gul in a tangle as he tries to defend them the ball almost rolls back into the stumps. Needs some nifty footwork from Gul and in the process he nearly kicks the stumps as well;
32.3;?;Watson to Umar Gul, no run that's a beauty, in fact too good for the No. 9 as it moves late to beat Gul's outside edge;
32.2;?;Watson to Umar Gul, no run beaten outside off as he pushes forward without any footwork;
32.1;?;Watson to Umar Gul, no run pushed down the leg side;
31.6;?;Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run finishes with a very short bouncer to ensure Gul has to face the next over;
31.5;?;Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run tucked into the square-leg area;
31.4;?;Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run back to some normality as Butt defends a ball on off stump;
31.3;1;Bollinger to Umar Gul, 1 run banged in on leg stump, worked down to long leg;
31.2;W;Bollinger to Amir, OUT gone! Well, he can bat but not today. A short ball from Bollinger finds the outside edge as Aamer fends away from the body and it's a regulation edge through to Paine - his fourth of the innings;Mohammad Amir c ?Paine b Bollinger 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
31.1;?;Bollinger to Amir, no run back of a length on off stump, Aamer plays inside the line;
30.6;W;Watson to Afridi, OUT and Watson's figures have just got even crazier! He's picked up Afridi, and I guess it was bound to happen but what a shame. It was on off stump again and he tried to repeat his drive for six, but didn't connect cleanly and slotted it straight up in the air where Johnson settled himself calmly;Shahid Afridi c Johnson b Watson 31 (13m 15b 4x4 2x6) SR: 206.66;
30.5;6;Watson to Afridi, SIX runs that's massive! Full on off stump and Afridi drives this monstrously over mid-off. Don't think it even came quite out of the middle, but cleared the rope with ease. What a counterattack.;
30.4;2;Watson to Afridi, 2 runs tucked neatly off middle stump through the leg side and Afridi is also very quick between the wickets which makes this into a couple;
30.3;4;Watson to Afridi, FOUR runs ooh, a bit of touch and elegance this time as he opens the face and picks the gap between second slip and gully...he waited for the ball outside off and steered it superbly;
30.2;?;Watson to Afridi, no run back of a length, pushes hard with an opening face towards point;
30.1;4;Watson to Afridi, FOUR runs another boundary, full and wide of off stump and launches himself into a lofted cover drive which goes two bounces over the rope;
29.6;2;Bollinger to Salman Butt, 2 runs offered some width and guides this neatly wide of gully, nice timing but the point sweeper is able to cut off the boundary;
29.5;1;Bollinger to Afridi, 1 run worked off this hip towards where short leg was;
29.4;?;Bollinger to Afridi, no run good leave, and it really was, as this one nips back from off stump;
29.3;?;Bollinger to Afridi, no run oh boy, now he's tried to pick this up from a good length and launch it over midwicket with a front-foot pull...doesn't make contact, but could easily have edged that or dragged it on (or hit it for six, I guess!);
29.2;?;Bollinger to Afridi, no run bouncer over off stump and Afridi holds himself back by ducking underneath...how boring of him (only kidding, of course);
29.1;1;Bollinger to Salman Butt, 1 run on off stump, angled away through backward point to the sweeper and a huge cheer as it brings Afridi back on strike;
28.6;6;Watson to Afridi, SIX runs here we go, strap in folks, Boom Boom is away as he flicks Watson off middle stump right into the lower tier of the Grandstand;
28.5;4;Watson to Afridi, FOUR runs no holding back, slashes hard at this outside off stump, it was full and swinging away but that won't bother Afridi who throws everything at it and clears backward point;
28.4;?;Watson to Afridi, no run back on off stump and defended firmly into the covers;
28.3;4;Watson to Afridi, FOUR runs first loose ball from Watson, drifting onto leg stump and it's flicked effortlessly through the leg side...in the air, but no fielders there;
28.2;?;Watson to Afridi, no run what a cracker first up, holds its line and beats Afridi's outside edge as he pushes at the ball;
28.1;W;Watson to Kamran, OUT gone! Now Watson has two, what a turn up this is. And Kamran didn't even play a shot! He completely misjudged the line and went to pad up, but the ball was heading straight for middle and off. By the time he realised it was too late and Rudi Koertzen's slow finger was already being raised;Kamran Akmal lbw b Watson 0 (6m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
27.6;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run left alone;
27.5;4;Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs on leg stump and flicked very neatly through midwicket with enough power to evade deep square-leg who run around the boundary;
27.4;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run outside off and left alone;
27.3;4;Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs top shot...full delivery on off stump and Butt slots it between mid-off and cover with a perfect drive. That takes him to an impressive fifty off 78 balls. He needs to at least double that, though;
27.2;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run back of a length, touch of extra bounce and Butt defends into the covers;
27.1;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run on off stump, defended square on the off side;
26.6;?;Watson to Kamran, no run touch wider and left alone;
26.5;?;Watson to Kamran, no run beaten! Good ball first up and Kamran pushes tentatively forward as the ball scoots past the edge;
26.4;W;Watson to Umar Akmal, OUT gone! He's made the breakthrough, basically with a straight ball that Umar just plays right across and that looked pretty good on first impression. Watson celebrates with some feeling;Umar Akmal lbw b Watson 5 (31m 21b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.8;
26.3;?;Watson to Umar Akmal, no run full on off stump, gentle pace so far, and driven up to mid-on;
26.2;?;Watson to Umar Akmal, no run stays in the crease this time and defends into the covers;
26.1;?;Watson to Umar Akmal, no run starts full on the stumps, Umar uses his feet and works it to the leg side...positive from the batsman;
25.6;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run full on the stumps, searching for swing, and Butt drives confidently towards mid-off;
25.5;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run a very short bouncer this time and Butt has fewer issues getting out of the way;
25.4;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run on off stump, Butt defends as though that kept a fraction low but think it was just a touch fuller than he thought;
25.3;4;Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs edged! But through the gap wide of second slip and down to third man...Ponting has taken a slip out for Butt, although that may have evaded even a third;
25.2;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run loses his line down the leg side and Paine makes a good diving save, managing to get hands to the ball;
25.1;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run good bouncer, follows Butt with the angle from over the wicket as he sways out of the line and Paine takes it on the rise;
24.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Umar Akmal, no run bat on ball this time as he defends into the covers;
24.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Umar Akmal, no run no shot needed again as Hilfenhaus probes outside off trying to tempt a drive from Umar;
24.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Umar Akmal, no run outside off and moves away from the right hander;
24.3;2;Hilfenhaus to Umar Akmal, 2 runs tucked off his legs into the square-leg area...nice use of the wrists to find the gap;
24.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Umar Akmal, no run full outside off, swings away and nicely left alone;
24.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Umar Akmal, no run on middle and Umar defends to the leg side;
23.6;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run back on that aggressive full length, pushed to cover;
23.5;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run banged in short, and that fizzes through to the keeper;
23.4;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run attacking the top of off stump with a touch of movement. Defended to cover with a vertical bat;
23.3;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run prodded out to backward point, it's a war of attrition for the batsmen at the moment. And utterly absorbing viewing;
23.2;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run half-forward, jabbed out to cover;
23.1;1;Johnson to Umar Akmal, 1 run flicked up to mid-on;
22.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run outside off, a probing over;
22.5;2;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, 2 runs short and whipped firmly to square leg. Good batting;
22.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run driven hard, and half-fielded by the bowler;
22.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run outswinger, well disguised, and pushed to cover;
22.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run much tighter line, and much better judgment. No stroke;
22.1;4;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, FOUR runs a touch of width, and Butt chases with hard hands, and gets away with it. A poor stroke, no foot movement and a slashing edge flies through third man. He admonishes himself for that lapse in concentration;
21.6;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run edged, but just short of second slip! Another excellent delivery, angling across the right-hander, but Umar's soft hands save him there. He's battling well;
21.5;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run defended once again. No freebies on offer in this spell;
21.4;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run full length and firmly drilled back down the track, Johnson dives in his followthrough to cut off the single. Good commitment;
21.3;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run pushed out to point off the back foot;
21.2;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run short and aggressive, and Umar wears it on the chest as he drops his gloves out of the way. Played well in the end;
21.1;2;Johnson to Umar Akmal, 2 runs banged in short, and fenced out to square leg. Johnson fielded well at first, but a loose return gifts an overthrow;
20.6;4;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, FOUR runs cut and cut hard. That was a touch short and sat up to be hit. And so it was. Top shot;
20.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run blocked firmly on off stump;
20.4;2;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, 2 runs nurdled off the pads, and out to midwicket;
20.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run excellent bowling, an inswinging yorker, but Butt was equal to it. Needed Aamer's pace to penetrate those defences;
20.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run not such a good line as the swing takes this past the leg stump. Paine gathers well with a stretch to his right;
20.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run good delivery, swinging back onto the stumps. Tight line;
19.6;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run speared down the leg-side, that's the end of a successful over;

19.4;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run through to the keeper with a bit of extra pace;

 Innings Start
So, that - finally - brings an end to Australia's innings after some grinding resistance from their lower order. Paine and Hilfenhaus put on 74 for the ninth wicket before these two added a further 52. Australia are totally in charge of this game now, Pakistan will need 440 to win this game, and there's a session and two days for Australia to chip away. The players wander off towards the pavilion for the tea interval.
Pakistan will need to set a new world record if they are to win this game, beating the previous record chase of 418 for 7 by West Indies against Australia at the ARG in Antigua. The highest fourth innings chase at Lord's is 344 for 1, by West Indies in 1984. Pakistan's highest winning fourth innings total is 315 for 9, against Australia in Karachi in 1994. So history is not exactly on their side.
In the other international match being played today, Bangladesh are being given a tough time by Ireland's openers at Stormont, and something of an upset is on the cards!
There's also Andrew Miller's teatime bulletin to enjoy.

62.4;1;Umar Gul to Paine, 1 run angled to backward point, where the fielder had been pushed back after that uppercut, and so an easy single;
62.3;?;Umar Gul to Paine, no run Gul puts some extra effort into this one, and extracts some life from the pitch. But it's outside off and Paine can easily leave;

61.3;?;Danish Kaneria to Hilfenhaus, no run tapped nervously back to the bowler;
61.2;W;Danish Kaneria to Smith, OUT but this time he's gone! The bowling change does the trick! Kaneria floated one up on middle and off and the ball just hurried on straight after pitching, striking the front pad and then the bat. Huge appeal from the bowler straight away, who was convinced, and the umpire agrees. That's a good decision, would've hit middle stump three inches from the top;Steven Smith lbw b Danish Kaneria 12 (32m 17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 70.58;
61.1;4;Danish Kaneria to Smith, FOUR runs savagely swept by Smith! Confidence first ball, getting down on one knee and slammed behind square leg. He hit that really hard, but rolled his wrists over it to keep the ball down;

59.4;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run good leave from Paine, as Asif lands one in the channel just outside off and gets the ball to nip away after pitching. It was left on length really;

58.6;1;Umar Gul to Paine, 1 run the final ball of the over is full outside off, and Paine taps to cover to pick up a single and keep the strike;
58.5;?;Umar Gul to Paine, no run Gul bends his back and finds some extra nip off the pitch to strike Paine a painful blow amidships. Ouch. He's down and just taking a bit of a breather now. Where's the magic spray when you need it? The physio is out now, not sure what he's going to do... The umpire is also just having a quick work with Gul about running on the wicket. He has been following through down the pitch;
58.4;?;Umar Gul to Paine, no run short outside off, not quite the bouncer but short enough to have Paine ducking and swaying out of the way;
58.3;?;Umar Gul to Paine, no run nice and full from Gul, but Paine is playing a very watchful innings and taps cautiously to mid-on;
58.2;1;Umar Gul to Smith, 1 run short on off stump, Smith flaps wildly and they pick up a single as the ball rolls to midwicket;
58.1;?;Umar Gul to Smith, no run on a length and coming in to the right-hander after pitching. Smith defends back to the bowler, who threatens to throw the stumps down and gives him a good eyeballing;
57.6;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run pitching just outside off and moving away slightly, Paine leaves yet again. He didn't lay bat on ball in that over;
57.5;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run short on off stump, medium-paced at best and Paine weaves out of the way with time to spare;
57.4;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run fuller still, and shaping away again, but Paine leaves well alone;
57.3;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run tempting delivery, full but not quite there to drive and outside off. Paine will not be tempted, however, and raises his bat high over his head as the ball shoots past him;
57.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run bouncer from Asif, but not much pace on the ball and Paine ducks underneath easily;
57.1;1;Mohammad Asif to Smith, 1 run full and wobbling away a touch through the air, the ball is tapped to midwicket for a quick single;
56.6;4;Umar Gul to Paine, FOUR runs Gul aims for the yorker but doesn't quite get it right and Paine clips the resultant half-volley firmly through wide midwicket. Two fielders chase after it, and though Umar Amin dives at the boundary he can't quite cut it off;
56.5;1;Umar Gul to Smith, 1 run just short of a good length and angling towards leg stump, Smith hops back and nudges just wide of mid-on;
56.4;?;Umar Gul to Smith, no run a touch of cut back in off the wicket, and Smith stays at the crease to defend back to the bowler;
56.3;2;Umar Gul to Smith, 2 runs much fuller this time, a half-volley outside off and Smith drives through the covers in his peculiar style, the left leg pointing towards mid-on;
56.2;?;Umar Gul to Smith, no run short outside offstump, Smith has a huge swing at the ball but can't get anything on it. That really took off after pitching. Gul walks down after his follow-through to have a word in his ear;
56.1;?;Umar Gul to Smith, no run on a length, just shaping away a touch and Smith defends to off from the crease;
55.6;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run on a length, just outside off and holding its line. For the third time Paine leaves, and Kamran collects the ball on the bounce;
55.5;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run nice outswinger, but again it's too wide to get Paine playing;
55.5;1nb;Mohammad Asif to Paine, (no ball) after sending down a couple of indippers, Asif gets one to hold its line outside off. But it's just a little too wide to get Paine playing at it. He's also been called for another no-ball, and that's a very tight call I must say. Millimetres in it.;
55.4;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run Asif is attacking the stumps here, as he sends another inswinger down very full. This time Paine drives slightly more firmly, but mid-on is quickly round to cut it off;
55.3;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run very full again, almost a yorker, and it's dug out to the leg side;
55.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Paine, no run testing stuff from Asif, bending one back in through the air. Importantly, it was also full, but Paine got right behind it to drive with the straightest of bats back down the wicket;
55.2;2nb;Mohammad Asif to Smith, (no ball) 1 run leg-stump half-volley to starty, and it's flicked down to fine leg. And Asif has also over-stepped in his enthusiasm, so that's a no-ball;
55.1;W;Mohammad Asif to North, OUT got him! Two wickets very quickly after lunch for Pakistan! This was very similar to Katich's dismissal, on a length outside off and nipping away off the seam. North thrust the bat out without moving his feet much and got a fine edge on the ball. Kamran did really well behind the stumps, as the ball really dipped on the way to him and he had to tumble forward and to his left to cling on. Game on now!;Marcus North c ?Kamran Akmal b Mohammad Asif 20 (52m 25b 2x4 0x6) SR: 80;
54.6;?;Umar Gul to Paine, no run well bowled, on middle and defended to mid-off;
54.5;W;Umar Gul to Katich, OUT gone! Gul strikes and Katich misses a ton for the second time in the game. He just felt for this outside off, it was back of a length and seamed away a touch. Very similar to his first-innings dismissal;Simon Katich c ?Kamran Akmal b Umar Gul 83 (244m 174b 14x4 0x6) SR: 47.7;
54.4;?;Umar Gul to Katich, no run too wide and left alone;

53.4;?;Danish Kaneria to North, no run flatter on off stump, defended to the off side;
53.3;4;Danish Kaneria to North, FOUR runs uses his feet and fetches this from outside off and launches it over mid-on...confident shot, and that's one way to play for lunch;
53.2;?;Danish Kaneria to North, no run better line on middle, defended back to the bowler;
53.1;2;Danish Kaneria to North, 2 runs dragged down short on leg stump, North pulls it fine past the keeper;
52.6;?;Amir to Katich, no run pushed down to mid-off;
52.5;4;Amir to Katich, FOUR runs well played as he chops this down between second and gully...no one down at third man. He was in full control of that as he waited for the ball and played it into the ground;
52.4;?;Amir to Katich, no run driven sweetly but straight to cover;
52.3;?;Amir to Katich, no run outside off, no swing this time and defended back to the bowler;
52.2;?;Amir to Katich, no run rare loose shot from Katich as he flashes at a cut, but to be fair it was probably there to hit;
52.1;3;Amir to North, 3 runs good shot as he leans into a half volley and slots it through the covers...Kaneria sprints hard and manages to pull it up;
51.6;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run that's a better line, closer to off stump and it shapes back into Katich as he shoulders arms;
51.5;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run outside off and Katich isn't interested...he's focussing on lunch now (the interval that is, not the food);
51.4;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run worked away from off stump to square leg who makes a diving save;
51.3;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run half volley which Katich leans into but picks out cover;
51.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run very wide and easily left alone;
51.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run round the wicket, very full and Katich can't time his drive which bobbles back to the bowler;
50.6;1;Amir to Katich, 1 run short and wide but he gets away with it because the point sweeper is out there to stop Katich's cut;
50.5;?;Amir to Katich, no run ooh, well bowled, much straighter this time and it takes an inside edge into the pads;
50.4;?;Amir to Katich, no run wider this time and it doesn't require a shot;
50.3;?;Amir to Katich, no run feels for this outside off but it goes straight to ground on the way to gully;
50.2;?;Amir to Katich, no run outside off again, no need to play from Katich;
50.1;?;Amir to Katich, no run full outside off and left alone;
49.6;3;Mohammad Asif to Katich, 3 runs lovely shot, floated up on middle and Katich whips it wide of mid-on where Afridi has to chase hard;

49.4;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run defended with an open face to backward point;
49.3;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run outside off and it loops through to the keeper...Asif is ambling in more than normal at then moment;
49.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run on off stump, hint of movement and defended to cover;
49.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run outside off and left alone...a gentle one to start with;

48.4;?;Amir to North, no run comes across the crease and defends from off stump to mid-on;
48.3;4;Amir to North, FOUR runs too short but not that wide and North plays a lovely square drive off the back foot which races through point...that will boost his confidence;
48.2;?;Amir to North, no run pushed into the off side;

47.3;?;Afridi to Katich, no run quicker ball outside off, defended to the off side;
47.2;4;Afridi to Katich, FOUR runs full and wide, Katich cracks him handsomely through the covers with a powerful drive...these are freebie runs with Afridi in the attack;

44.5;1;Umar Gul to Katich, 1 run back of a length and worked off the body backward of square on the leg side;
44.4;3;Umar Gul to North, 3 runs leg stump again and flicked away neatly through midwicket...always threatens to fall over a little, but it's finding the middle so far;
44.3;?;Umar Gul to North, no run tight line on off stump and defended to the off side;
44.2;?;Umar Gul to North, no run that's a better line, rising over off stump and North shows good judgement to leave alone;

43.6;?;Afridi to Katich, no run defended into the covers;
43.5;2;Afridi to Katich, 2 runs tucked around the corner through short fine leg;
43.4;?;Afridi to Katich, no run technically that's dropped at short leg as Katich flicks it off the face, but unlike the first innings against Ponting he couldn't hang on...they just have to stick and this one didn't;

43.1;?;Afridi to Katich, no run round the wicket, outside off and defended to cover;
42.6;W;Umar Gul to Johnson, OUT that's pitched up! Swinging, dipping full toss from Gul and that's totally surprised Johnson, who tried to glance to leg but didn't seem to pick the ball up. Well, the ball has smashed into the middle and off stumps, so obviously not! That's 100 Test wickets for Gul, and a nice way to get there for a fast bowler, splaying the batsman's stumps;Mitchell Johnson b Umar Gul 30 (104m 54b 5x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
42.5;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run that's the way to bowl! Gul pitches it up, finally, and immediately has Johnson in all kinds of trouble. Stifled appeal as he's struck on the pad, but that was bending down the leg side. Good bowling though, he just needs to keep it there!;
42.4;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run short and wide down the leg side. A waste of a delivery;
42.3;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run Gul pitches this one up, but it's wide of off stump and Johnson leaves. The ball swings appreciably after passing the batsman, and Kamran does really well to stop that in the end!;
42.2;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run brave leave! Left on length by Johnson, and the ball shoots right over middle stump;
42.1;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run back-of-a-length on leg stump, Johnson plays no shot as he's hit on the... well, the buttocks, for lack of a better word. They run a single, but the umpire calls dead ball as no stroke was played.;
41.6;?;Afridi to Katich, no run beaten outside off! This was a great piece of bowling, full just outside off stump and Katich is drawn into a defensive prod. The ball just holds its line to beat the edge;

40.6;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run fuller and quicker, Johnson defends from the crease to cover;
40.5;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run just short of a good length, but pitching just outside off and angling further away and so left alone. The ball swings in the air on its way through to Kamran, who can't quite hold on cleanly;
40.4;1;Umar Gul to Katich, 1 run back-of-a-length, and clipped off the hip infront of square for a quick single;

39.3;?;Afridi to Johnson, no run full and wide of off, Johnson is quite happy to leave;
39.2;?;Afridi to Johnson, no run quick through the air, turning in slightly and defended;
39.1;1;Afridi to Katich, 1 run full outside off, and nudged through point for a single to take the partnership between these two batsmen to fifty;
38.6;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run back of a length, on off stump and Johnson leaves on length. A maiden from Gul, but he could have done more in that over if he'd pitched it up more. He had Johnson in real trouble with the one ball he did land close to the batsman;
38.5;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run short again, but this time it's misdirected down the leg side. There's drizzle in the air now, Gul may be better advised to keep pitching it up as there's bound to be some movement;
38.4;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run short and sharp again, Johnson whips his head out of the way as the ball shoots past at head height. Gul is enjoying himself out there;
38.3;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run sharp pace and movement as Gul pitches one full! Johnson was squared up as he played leaden-footed from the crease, and the ball squirts to mid-off;
38.2;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run this isn't all that short, but Johnson tries a flicked pull to midwicket. Can't connect though, and he's struck on the thigh pad. Umpire Koertzen is just having a word with him for running on the wicket as well;
38.1;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run back-of-a-length and tapped back down the wicket;
37.6;4;Danish Kaneria to Katich, FOUR runs wonderful drive from Katich, who places the ball perfectly to bisect mid-off and extra cover. The ball is chased all the way to the rope, but the fielder can't haul it back in time;
37.5;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run defensively prodded to cover;
37.4;4b;Danish Kaneria to Katich, 4 byes arrowed down the leg side, the ball shoots past leg stump and between Kamran's legs for four byes;
37.3;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run firmly swept by Katich, and the short leg fielder wears this one.;
37.2;1;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, 1 run spinning back from leg to off, but it's pitched outside leg and Johnson nudges gently to square leg to get off strike;
37.1;?;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, no run nice length from Kaneria, the ball goes on straight but Johnson is back and across to defend;
36.6;?;Umar Gul to Katich, no run testing first over from Gul! He pulls the length back a touch and gets the ball to nip the other way off the seam, striking Katich in the midriff as he's caught at the crease;
36.5;?;Umar Gul to Katich, no run Gul stays full to Katich, this time it's well wide of off stump and easily left alone;
36.4;?;Umar Gul to Katich, no run tapped to midwicket, Johnson wants the single but he's wisely sent back;
36.3;4;Umar Gul to Katich, FOUR runs Gul goes full, a straight half-volley and Katich clips him through square leg for four. That was uppishly hit, definitely catchable had there been a man just behind square, but there's a gap there and so it's a boundary;
36.2;1;Umar Gul to Johnson, 1 run more back-of-a-length stuff, again Johnson is hurried as he leans back to pull, but gets enough glove/splice on this to pick up a single;
36.1;?;Umar Gul to Johnson, no run short again! This one was really well directed though, beating Johnson for pace as he tries to swivel into a pull. Gul ambles down to give him a word of encouragement. "Don't worry, you'll hit the next one," he says. I think.;
36.1;1w;Umar Gul to Johnson, 1 wide lively start! Bouncer from Gul, but that's much too short, ballooning over Johnson and left alone;
35.6;1;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, 1 run slow, looping full toss, driven to mid-on, who is deep and so the single is on;
35.5;?;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, no run wrong 'un! But Johnson picks it this time as he stays deep in the crease, and defends to off;
35.4;4;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, FOUR runs slog-swept! Powerfully hit by Johnson, pick the ball up from outside off and lifting it over wide long-on.;
35.3;?;Danish Kaneria to Johnson, no run quicker through the air, and turning in fairly sharply. Too short though, and he's lucky that Johnson picks out mid-on with a forcing backfoot drive;
35.2;1;Danish Kaneria to Katich, 1 run Kaneria pulls the length back a touch and goes straighter too, and is clipped to short fine leg. That was a good length though, Katich came forward but the ball was given time to spin;
35.1;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run full, and temptingly wide of off. Katich drives to mid-off;
34.6;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run Asif does pitch it up, looking for that swing, but Johnson plays watchfully to the straight midwicket fielder;
34.5;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run good leave from Johnson, as Asif pitches one just outside off and gets the ball to nip away after landing;
34.4;4;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, FOUR runs great shot from Johnson, who pushes the ball firmly back the wicket with a nicely poised straight drive. There was nothing brutal about that hit, it was all about technique and timing;
34.3;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run defensively pushed to cover off the back foot;
34.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run this one is angled down the leg side, takes the bottom off the thigh pad to change direction and just miss the leg stump and roll to Kamran Akmal's left;
34.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run right on target from Asif, swinging one back in towards off stump as Johnson drills the ball back down the wicket with a straight bat;
33.6;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run and solid defence to finish a tight first over of the day from Kaneria;
33.5;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run Katich stays deep in the crease and defends back down the wicket;
33.4;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run tapped to mid-off once again;
33.3;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run full, and driven to mid-off;
33.2;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run this one turns in much more sharply, Katich gets across to off stump and clips to leg;
33.1;?;Danish Kaneria to Katich, no run gentle spin in to start, and Katich presses forward to defend;
32.6;2;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, 2 runs flicked off the pad and out through square leg for a couple;
32.5;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run that is the one to leave, full and wide of off. Some movement off the seam takes it even further away;
32.4;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run slippery stuff from Asif, who again has Johnson leaving the ball when he really should be playing at it. Again the ball would have flown well over leg stump, but that wasn't the greatest leave;
32.3;3;Mohammad Asif to Katich, 3 runs nudged down past gully, and some hard running gets Katich a couple;
32.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run not too far away from the leg stump! As is his wont, Katich shuffles right across to off and exposes the leg stump, Asif curves one down the leg side but that was just slightly misdirected.;
32.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Katich, no run on a length, angling across Katich and left alone outside off stump;
31.6;4;Amir to Johnson, FOUR runs crunched back down the wicket! That was a one-day shot from Johnson, as Aamer pitched one on a length and straight and he just flat-batted it straight back down the wicket. He looked, initially, to be looking to pull, but hit the ball so early;
31.5;4;Amir to Johnson, FOUR runs too straight again from Aamer, Johnson clips neatly through backward square leg. Well, some very relaxed fielding from Asif on the boundary has let that through for four! He really just ambled across, running the ball over the rope with no effort whatsoever to stop it...;
31.4;?;Amir to Johnson, no run Aamer just needs to straighten his line here, as he again goes wide of off and is left alone;
31.3;4;Amir to Johnson, FOUR runs back of a length, slanting down the leg side. Johnson clips to fine leg, getting a thin connection on the ball to beat a diving Kamran Akmal and pick up four;
31.2;?;Amir to Johnson, no run wide of off stump and left alone by Johnson;
31.1;1;Amir to Katich, 1 run full, swinging in, and nudged to short fine leg. That's fifty for Katich, and it's been a really gritty, stubborn knock so far.;
30.6;2;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, 2 runs swinging in again, and off the inner half of the bat to midwicket;
30.5;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run close! Huge appeal from Asif as he gets one to swerve the other way through the air. Johnson didn't pick the change, leaving once again, and is struck on the pad. The umpire says no, and actually though it initially looked very close indeed that was missing leg and also going over the top. Misjudged leave though, to be sure;
30.4;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run Asif has found a good length here, not quite full enough to drive but close enough to find some movement. Again Johnson leaves;
30.3;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run a bit more nip in this delivery as Asif pulls the length back a touch. Again, the ball jags away off the seam but Johnson leaves well alone;
30.2;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run fuller this time, Asif looking for that swing early on. But Johnson moves nicely forward, keeping his balance and driving firmly to mid-off;
30.1;?;Mohammad Asif to Johnson, no run loosener to start, just floating one down outside off, but decent movement away from the bat. Left alone by Johnson;

And we'll have Danish Kaneria introduced to the attack early on. He really had Johnson in trouble in the first innings, but he'll be bowling to Katich first up.
 Innings Start
Phew, well, that's a dramatic end to the Test. This story will run and run and probably change a few times as well! Anyway, for now I'm going sign off. Don't forget the second Test starts on Wednesday at Headingley and we'll bring you all the action from that. For today, though, that's all from Andrew McGlashan and Liam Brickhill. Thanks for joining us.
This is typical Pakistan cricket. It's a shambles, but it sounds as though Afridi is retiring after the Headingley Test. OK, we have a story up now so this will be the place for all the latest news on this breaking saga. And if you want to catch up on the match, have a read of Andrew Miller's bulletin which will be ready shortly.
That wraps up the presentation, but we have a little more news on Afridi. He has nominated Salman Butt as his successor, but says it will be a board decision. He is struggling with a thigh injury, apparently. We expect more news to come out of the press conference and we'll, of course, cover it in depth with our guys at the ground.
"It was a good win. It was tough batting and our tail wagged nicely yesterday to give us a good total. We've got two guys on the honours board who probably didn't expect to be there. We had to look at different ways to get wickets and they did a good job. You have to adapt your game in these conditions. Katich played beautifully."
Now the Aussies each get a copy of Wisden...and up comes Ricky Ponting.
"Australia are a very professional team and hard to play against," Afridi says. "But we needed more runs in the first innings. We needed to support Salman Butt more. We didn't get the big partnerships. The bowlers did well." So, no word on the captaincy there
All the players are now getting commemorative leather-bound Wisdens. That'll be a good read for them. And here comes Afridi.
There are two Man-of-the-Match awards in this game. That's odd. Anyway, the Pakistan award goes to Salman Butt. The Australian award goes to Simon Katich, although Paul Allott almost forgot who it was. "It was a great win," he says. "We knew it would be tough. I had a bit of luck which helps but thankfully things went my way."
Well, we are hearing news from the ground (not fully confirmed at the moment) that Shahid Afridi has just told Jim Maxwell on radio that the Headingley Test will be his last. We'll bring you more news as we get it. First we have the presentation so we might hear something from this...
Rohan from Spain makes a very valid point. "Take the last two wicket stands from Australia's second innings (120-odd) and we may have had an interesting match!" Just shows the value of tail-end runs.
"In the first innings Pakistan collapsed to Shane Watson. In the second innings Pakistan collapsed to part time offspinner North," says Abdullah. "In the next test match Pakistan will collapse to Simon Katich and Michael Clarke."
Australia win by 150 runs and it's been an impressive performance. They fought hard with the bat in bowler-friendly conditions and their own attack found two unlikely heroes in Shane Watson and Marcus North, whose 6 for 55 is a first-class best, but a word too for Ben Hilfenhaus who bowled very well. Pakistan will have to dig deep for the second Test at Headingley which starts on Wednesday. Stay with us for the presentation which will follow shortly.

68.6;1;Johnson to Amir, 1 run full, fast and swinging in towards the pad. Aamer gets an edge onto his pad to get off the mark as the ball rolls into the huge gap at cover - there are no men infront of the bat on the off side!;
68.5;?;Johnson to Amir, no run sharp bouncer from Johnson, and he has Aamer nervously ducking straight away;
68.4;1;Johnson to Kamran, 1 run pushed infront of square on the off side this time, and they sneak through for one;
68.3;4;Johnson to Kamran, FOUR runs full and very wide of off stump, Kamran slashes hard to send the ball flying through gully for four. An adventurous stroke, to say the least;

68.1;?;Johnson to Kamran, no run on a length, well wide of off and Kamran leaves;

67.5;W;North to Afridi, OUT that's just frustrating. Afridi tries to heave the ball into the grandstand with a slog sweep, but hits it very high but not very far. Hussey sets himself underneath the swirling chance, holding on to a good catch. Pakistan are crumbling now.;Shahid Afridi c Hussey b North 2 (2m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
67.4;?;North to Afridi, no run Afridi plays and misses outside off;
67.3;2;North to Afridi, 2 runs Afridi is off the mark, angling the ball down towards third man. He wasn't entirely in control of that though, it dropped just short of slip;
67.2;?;North to Afridi, no run Afridi has a mow at his first ball, drilling the ball along the ground to mid-off;
67.1;W;North to Umar Amin, OUT gone! North picks up another one, arrowing the ball in towards middle and leg to take the inside edge of Amin's bat. The ball ricocheted off the bat/pad and flew very quickly to Katich at short leg, who held onto a brilliant reflex catch. Clinical stuff from Australia, and Pakistan are sliding now;Umar Amin c Katich b North 33 (93m 55b 4x4 0x6) SR: 60;
66.6;?;Johnson to Kamran, no run landing on a length on middle and leg, Kamran drives to mid-on;
66.5;4;Johnson to Kamran, FOUR runs loose, wafty drive from Kamran, and the ball flies at a very catchable height through gully. The ball was well wide of him and he seemed in two minds as to whether to play or leave, and eventually is lucky that the ball went wide of third slip;
66.4;4;Johnson to Kamran, FOUR runs well played by Kamran, who tickles a rising delivery on leg stump down to the fine leg boundary. Kamran shuffled across to flick and get it down much finer than the fielder;
66.3;?;Johnson to Kamran, no run angling across the right-hander, who walks into a punchy drive to mid-off;

64.5;?;Johnson to Kamran, no run Kamran pushes away from his body to drive on the up to cover;
64.4;1;Johnson to Umar Amin, 1 run tricky delivery, rising up into the ribs but it's well played by Amin, who takes the bottom hand off the bat and guides to fine leg;
64.3;1;Johnson to Kamran, 1 run on the pads and Kamran Akmal gets off the mark with a glance to fine leg;

63.3;W;North to Umar Akmal, OUT gone! Would you believe it. North the destroyer. There was some extra bounce outside off as Umar tried to cut and it took a top edge to Clarke at slip. What a blow for Pakistan.;Umar Akmal c Clarke b North 22 (35m 30b 3x4 1x6) SR: 73.33;
63.2;1;North to Umar Amin, 1 run tossed up from around the wicket, driven nicely towards mid-off who is quite deep;
63.1;1;North to Umar Akmal, 1 run nice footwork as he whips this through midwicket with a turn of the wrists;

60.5;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run good bouncer, tighter to the batsman so he has to watch it more closely;
60.4;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run that's a good one outside off and beats the edge but Umar probably didn't need to play at that;
60.3;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run full and very wide, driven to point...didn't quite time that;
60.2;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run ooh, he nearly pops this up to cover as he pushes forward...may have been a fraction slower;
60.1;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run bouncer over off stump and Umar barely has to duck to get out of the way;
59.6;1;North to Umar Akmal, 1 run drags this down short in response and it's cut away to the cover sweeper;
59.5;6;North to Umar Akmal, SIX runs great shot...he uses his feet and launches North over mid-on with the power to comfortably clear the ropes. Such potential in Umar;

55.2;?;North to Umar Akmal, no run wide outside off and left alone;
55.1;W;North to Salman Butt, OUT gone! First ball...North does the trick and Salman Butt is distraught. The ball drifted down the leg side, Butt went to work it through the leg side and overbalanced out of his crease. Paine was very swift to take off the bails and the batsman can hardly drag himself off. The third umpire wasn't even asked for;Salman Butt st ?Paine b North 92 (233m 173b 15x4 0x6) SR: 53.17;
54.6;4;Bollinger to Umar Amin, FOUR runs drifts onto leg stump that's flicked just over the man at square leg...hands on head for Bollinger;

53.3;4;Watson to Umar Amin, FOUR runs lovely shot, width outside and he leans into the perfect cover drive...finds the gap in a packed off side;
53.2;?;Watson to Umar Amin, no run full and outside off, hint of movement back into the left hander as he leaves alone;
53.1;4;Watson to Umar Amin, FOUR runs on leg stump, nicely tucked away down to fine leg and that goes pretty quickly to the boundary;
52.6;?;Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run and another short one to end the over and it's heading over leg stump this time but it's well avoided;

50.6;?;Bollinger to Umar Amin, no run full and straight, Amin times a push to leg but mid-on tumbles to his left to stop the ball;
50.5;1;Bollinger to Salman Butt, 1 run back of a length, just outside off and Butt forces out to deep cover for a single;
50.4;?;Bollinger to Salman Butt, no run Bollinger finds that off-stump line again and Butt defends;
50.3;4;Bollinger to Salman Butt, FOUR runs bad ball, full on the pads and Butt eases the ball out to the midwicket boundary. Elegant shot, very wristy and well-balanced.;

49.3;?;Watson to Umar Amin, no run pushed across him and wide of off, Amin does leave this time;
49.2;2;Watson to Umar Amin, 2 runs Amin is looking nervous here, this one shapes in a touch to take the inside edge and shoot down to fine leg. Watto holds his head. That was close;
49.1;?;Watson to Umar Amin, no run loose push from Amin, Watson spears the ball full and wide and Amin just fishes for it outside off. Lucky not to edge that, but he didn't even need to play at it;
48.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run full on off again to finish, Butt drives along the ground to the close catcher at straight mid-off;
48.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run slower ball from Hilfenhaus, trying to get Butt driving in the air, but he picks it and defends;

47.5;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run good ball, swinging a little into the pads and Butt jams the bat down in defence quite late. That was dead infront if he hadn't got bat to it;
47.4;1;Watson to Umar Amin, 1 run Amin is off the mark, not entirely convincingly. The ball squirts off the inner half of the bat towards backward square leg;
47.3;?;Watson to Umar Amin, no run full, wide of off and left alone by Amin first ball;
47.2;3;Watson to Salman Butt, 3 runs leg-stump half-volley, clipped down to fine leg where Hilfenhaus charges across and dives to stop it. Oh, hang on, he's jarred his shoulder on the turf here and is in some discomfort. He takes some time to get up again, and looks to be in pain. He's holding his left shoulder;
47.1;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run just short of a good length, but wide of off and going further with the angle and left alone;
46.6;W;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, OUT gone! Hilfenhaus gets the breakthrough! Ali had been patient, but Hilfenhaus was equally patient and kept plugging away on that off stump line as he has done all morning. He finds some wobble away through the air, the ball jagging away after pitching to take a thick edge and Paine does the rest behind the stumps. Ali didn't really do anything wrong, he had to play at it, just a really good piece of Test bowling;Azhar Ali c ?Paine b Hilfenhaus 42 (121m 87b 4x4 0x6) SR: 48.27;
46.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run on a length, just outside off and defended solidly back to the bowler;

46.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run another bouncer, very short again and Ali ducks underneath;
46.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run bouncer this time, keeping Ali deep in the crease I suppose. But it's not all that well directed, and is easily evaded;
46.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run wide of off stump, Ali raises his bat to leave;
45.6;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run crunchy checked-drive from Butt, but Clarke in the covers does well, diving to his right to cut the shot off;

45.4;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run Butt has timed his drives all morning, and does so again here, but picks out extra cover;

44.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, no run full on off stump, Butt drills a drive towards mid-off;
44.3;2;Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, 2 runs well, just a defensive push by Butt, but he times it really well and the ball bounces away through the covers. That takes the partnership between these two past 100;
44.2;1;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, 1 run dropped gently towards cover, between the fielders and they take the chance to steal a quick single. Good running;
44.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run full and wide outside off, going further away after pitching. Left alone;
43.6;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run apart from the first ball, a good over from Watson, who again keeps his line tight and Butt can only defend back to the bowler;

43.4;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run fuller and closer to the stumps, pushed back to the bowler;
43.3;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run this one is pushed across Butt, and goes on rather than coming back in to him. Left well alone;
43.2;?;Watson to Salman Butt, no run Watson finds some shape back in to the left-hander almost immediately. Butt defends back to the bowler from the crease;
43.1;4;Watson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs and he's angled through gully for four first ball! This was deliberately played by Butt, an authentic stroke as he placed the ball in the gap. Still no third man in place;
42.6;4;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs again through gully! This time Ali was trying to put it there, driving on the up and opening the face of the blade a touch. The shot wasn't a convincing one though, he sliced at it a touch and that could have been caught again. Hilfenhaus isn't pleased, and lets the batsman know;
42.5;4;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs leading edge! Great delivery, pitching middle and leg and nipping away towards off stump. Ali was completely undone, aiming to flick to leg but the ball took the leading edge and flew at a catchable height through gully;
42.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run Hilfenhaus pushes a full one slightly wider, but Ali won't be tempted and whips the bat out of the way;
42.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run tight line and length from Hilfenhaus, and Ali defends back down the pitch;

41.6;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run full and straight, Butt watches the ball onto the bat and defends to leg;
41.5;4;Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs this really isn't great bowling from Johnson, again giving Butt all the room he wants outside off, and once again he is thumped away through cover. Pakistan are up and running again;

41.3;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run straight again, aimed at middle and leg and Butt whips to square leg;
41.2;4;Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs Johnson is all over the place here, again he gives acres of width outside off and Butt crunches him through cover off the back foot. Resounding crack of the bat as the ball flies off the middle;
41.1;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run he is straight to start, and Butt flicks well but straight to square leg;
40.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run great delivery to finish, on that length just outside off and Hilfenhaus gets the ball to wobble away from the bat to beat the edge of Ali's defensive push;
40.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run bouncer this time, not all that pacy but it keeps Ali on the back foot and has him ducking;
40.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run good comeback by Hilfenhaus, bending his back to get some life out of the pitch outside off. But well played by Ali, who took his bottom hand off the bat and played it down with soft hands;
40.3;4;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs great shot, Ali just leans into a clipped glance through midwicket. Shades of Jacques Kallis in that shot, just caressed away;
40.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run this is pitched on a length, perhaps an inch or two wider of off and Ali guides to gully with his weight forward;
40.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run Hilfenhaus appears rather more disciplined, landing the ball on a testing length on off stump to elicit a defensive stroke from Ali;
39.6;4;Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs Johnson has been erratic in this over, and again he's been punished by Butt. This was short and wide outside off, this time Butt aimed for a good connection rather than trying to smash it, rolling his wrists over a cut to pick the gap past gully. Good shot;
39.5;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run Johnson stays full, Butt plays a punchy checked-drive to mid-off;
39.4;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run full on middle and off, and Butt leans forward to drive to mid-on;
39.3;2;Johnson to Salman Butt, 2 runs full again, but straighter this time, and Butt clips out through square leg for a couple;
39.2;4;Johnson to Salman Butt, FOUR runs slashed over point! Adventurous stuff from Butt, who latches onto a full, wide delivery and picks it up over backward point for the first boundary of the day. He looks confident;
39.1;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run on a length and wide of off, Butt flashes at it but doesn't seem to hit it... there's an appeal from the slips and bowler. There may well have been a little inside edge on that, but it's fallen short of Paine, and the Australians stifled their appeal as soon as they realised it hadn't carried;
38.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run Hilfenhaus draws Ali into the drive this time, but it was more exploratory than aggressive, and the ball is tapped gently to extra cover;

38.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run in the channel outside off and nipping away slightly, well left by Ali;

37.6;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run again Butt pushes forward to defend, this time playing the ball to leg;
37.5;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run slightly fuller this time, just outside off and Butt presses his weight forward and defends very solidly to off. A pleasingly tight forward defensive;
37.4;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run Johnson bends this one in slightly to the left-handed Butt, who steps back to defend towards cover point;
37.3;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run on target this time, on middle and off and defended into the leg side;
37.2;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run flung well down the leg side by Johnson, he's not quite fully loose yet. Tim Paine must be, though, as he makes a good, athletic stop behind the stumps;
37.1;?;Johnson to Salman Butt, no run good start from Johnson, just outside off with decent pace. Butt raises his bat out of the way and has a good look as the ball shoots past;
36.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run big appeal! Last ball of the day, but Rudi says not out as Azhar gets struck on the pad...Hilfenhaus was confident and it's fairly close. Replays say it would have taken leg stump. So a dramatic end.;
36.5;2;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, 2 runs gets a little too straight and it's neatly worked away through square leg;
36.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run squares him up on middle stump but he defends solidly to cover;
36.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Azhar Ali, no run fires down a bouncer and Azhar spots it quickly as he sinks underneath;

35.4;?;Smith to Salman Butt, no run round the wicket, big stride forward and defended into the off side;
