Data
So England have finished with 8 for 296, leaving Australia chasing 297 for victory. (Note: After the innings break this was updated to 8 for 300 due to an umpiring error that called ball 47.2 a two, when it should have been a six). What a fantastic innings from Eoin Morgan, his hundred was the difference between a sub-par total and something much more competitive. Australia thought they had him cheaply when he was caught in the deep but Morgan was alert to the fact they had too many fielders outside the circle and it was subsequently called a no-ball. This won't be an easy chase for Australia, but it is still gettable on a good pitch. Join us for the run chase in half an hour.

49.1;W;Faulkner to Morgan, OUT Morgan gets a low full toss and miscues it, finds the man at deep mid-off and that's the end of a wonderful innings of 106, Morgan has really given England's bowlers a strong target to defend;Eoin Morgan c Clarke b Faulkner 106 (138m 99b 4x4 6x6) SR: 107.07;
48.6;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run worked away through the leg side;
48.5;W;Coulter-Nile to Stokes, OUT Stokes is gone first ball! He's tried to launch this over the leg side and finds the man at deep midwicket, another one for Coulter-Nile;Ben Stokes c Maxwell b Coulter-Nile 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
48.4;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run Morgan jams down on a yorker and forces a single through off;
48.3;W;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, OUT Buttler skies this one and Clarke runs in from mid-on, appears at first to misjudge it and has to dive forward a bit but does indeed complete the catch, so Coulter-Nile gets the wicket he missed earlier, and England lose their sixth wicket, but Buttler has done a fine job;Jos Buttler c Clarke b Coulter-Nile 49 (54m 36b 3x4 1x6) SR: 136.11;
48.2;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run thumped through the leg side now;
48.2;2w;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 2 wide down leg this time as Coulter-Nile tries to follow the batsman but goes too far;
48.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run well bowled by Coulter-Nile, Buttler back off and Coulter-Nile went wide of off to keep the ball out of his reach;
47.6;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run crunched through midwicket for another single;
47.5;2;Johnson to Buttler, 2 runs struck down the ground and that's just a single;

47.3;2;Johnson to Buttler, 2 runs crunched away through midwicket now and Maxwell dives to reel it in inside the boundary;
47.3;1w;Johnson to Buttler, 1 wide wide of off;
47.2;6;Johnson to Buttler, SIX runs this one Buttler plays more conventionally, thumps it down the ground towards long-off and that looks to be clearing the rope - Marsh steps over the rope and jumps and pushes the ball back in. Hmm, he launched himself from outside the field of play and was in the air when he touched the ball to force it back into play. That must be six, surely? And has been changed subsequently;
47.1;?;Johnson to Buttler, no run Buttler tries to get fancy but it doesn't work, he's walked across well outside leg and tried to scoop it over Haddin, but doesn't manage to get hold of it and Haddin gloves the ball;
46.6;1lb;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 leg bye once again Coulter-Nile does well to follow Buttler as he backs away, can only manage a leg bye;
46.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run takes a swing at this through leg but just a single;
46.4;4;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, FOUR runs what a way to bring up the hundred! Morgan gets a shortish ball and simply - well, he makes it look simple - helps it on its way over the keeper's head where it bounces away to the boundary. That's his sixth ODI century and he's put England on track for a hefty total;
46.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run Morgan times this but doesn't place it, finds the man at mid-off;
46.2;1;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run Buttler backs away and takes a swing, doesn't time it and gets a single to long-on;

45.6;4;Faulkner to Buttler, FOUR runs this yorker is not quite right though, just a fraction too short and Buttler slaps this half-volley over extra cover for four more runs;
45.5;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run good yorker now as Faulkner gets the length right, Buttler pushes it back to him;
45.4;1;Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run he won't get the hundred just yet, forces a single through cover;
45.3;6;Faulkner to Morgan, SIX runs another six! Morgan has 96 now and this is the biggest six of the lot, he has launched an enormous swipe over midwicket to the long boundary - and it's gone many, many rows back into the crowd;
45.2;6;Faulkner to Morgan, SIX runs Morgan is on fire here! He's whipped a full toss off the middle-and-leg line and helped it on its way over square leg for six;
45.1;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run good yorker and all Buttler can do is push it through the off side;
44.6;6;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, SIX runs huge six! Morgan has timed this one magnificently, launched it way over the long-off boundary to add insult to injury for Coulter-Nile;
44.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run oh dear, Coulter-Nile has missed the chance for a wicket - by dropping the catch himself! Buttler has top-edged and this ball flies high into the off side, Bailey comes in and seems to want the catch but Coulter-Nile calls it, then seems to be in position but grasses the chance - then grasses himself, kneeling on the ground in anguish;
44.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run yet again Buttler tries to create space by backing away but Coulter-Nile does well to adjust and follows him, gives him no room and Buttler can only keep it out;
44.3;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run Morgan backs away now and can't middle it, just gets a single down towards long-off;
44.2;1;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run goes for the bouncer now and Buttler's hook bounces out to Warner at deep midwicket;
44.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run Buttler backs off and tries to force but can't beat the field;
43.6;2;Faulkner to Morgan, 2 runs tries for another heave through leg but doesn't quite time this one well enough to reach the square leg boundary;
43.5;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run good yorker - Morgan can't do anything but keep that out;
43.4;4;Faulkner to Morgan, FOUR runs another boundary, this time he's manouevred it through square leg where there is a gap;
43.3;6;Faulkner to Morgan, SIX runs powerful shot! Morgan has crunched Faulkner over long-on with such good timing and strength that it's made it ten rows back in the crowd, he could really get England's total moving here;
43.2;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run Morgan advances but his drive can't beat cover;
43.1;2;Faulkner to Morgan, 2 runs Morgan lifts this over wide midwicket and it's well timed but reeled in on the boundary;

42.4;1;Johnson to Morgan, 1 run Johnson goes fuller now and Morgan drives through point;
42.3;6;Johnson to Morgan, SIX runs super shot! Morgan has had a real crack at Johnson here, uses the pace of the ball and whacks this over cover with such timing that it has cleared the boundary!;
42.2;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run slower bouncer now from Johnson and Buttler shapes to hook, then adjusts and settles for a single to leg;
42.1;4;Johnson to Buttler, FOUR runs Buttler goes over the top now and doesn't quite time it, but had enough muscle behind it to get it away to the boundary at midwicket;
41.6;1;McKay to Buttler, 1 run again Buttler works it through leg, makes it a pretty productive over - 10 off it with no boundaries;
41.5;2;McKay to Buttler, 2 runs again Buttler uses the wrists nicely to flick this behind square from an off-stump line and his running is sharp enough to make that two;
41.4;1;McKay to Morgan, 1 run Morgan advances down the pitch but has to adjust his stroke and settles for a quick single nudged to point;
41.3;3;McKay to Buttler, 3 runs Buttler decides he's seen enough and backs away, lifts McKay over cover but didn't quite have the timing for it to reach the boundary;

40.4;?;Johnson to Morgan, no run defended back towards Johnson;
40.3;2;Johnson to Morgan, 2 runs Morgan is in busy Michael Hussey-mode here as he pushes through cover and calls and runs quickly, hares back for a second run;
40.3;1w;Johnson to Morgan, 1 wide well, this one has been called wide now, a bouncer that is probably just a touch too high as Morgan ducks;
40.2;?;Johnson to Morgan, no run interesting, no wide call from the umpire now as Morgan goes for a hook to a ball down leg - that was a long way down so the umpire must have felt there was some glove on that. Don't think there was - in any case it bounced short of Haddin;
40.1;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run Buttler turns this off his hips towards square leg;
39.6;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run drives down towards long-on;

38.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run again Coulter-Nile goes short, this time outside off and not quite as high, Buttler shapes to play and then leaves it alone;

37.1;W;Faulkner to Bopara, OUT Bopara's gone! He's tried to flick Faulkner through the leg side but has managed only to chip it up to George Bailey at short midwicket, straightforward catch and England are in a spot of bother now;Ravi Bopara c Bailey b Faulkner 24 (33m 19b 2x4 1x6) SR: 126.31;
36.6;1;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, 1 run pulls this forward of square;
36.5;6;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, SIX runs Bopara gets hold of this one! Lovely timing as he hits through the line and lifts Coulter-Nile over long-on for six, just a really clean strike;

32.5;?;Johnson to Bopara, no run bowls a steepler which has Bopara dropping his wrists;
32.4;?;Johnson to Bopara, no run short bouncer going down the leg side as Bopara doesn't offer a shot. I think he was banking on the umpire giving it a wide, but the hands are unmoved;
32.3;1;Johnson to Morgan, 1 run overpitched and driven down the ground, but doesn't get the timing quite right on this one;
32.2;2;Johnson to Morgan, 2 runs short of a length which is pulled behind square for a brace. Wasn't in complete control of that shot;
32.1;?;Johnson to Morgan, no run fuller one which is steered straight to silly mid-off;

29.6;W;Faulkner to Bell, OUT in the blockhole as Bell plays this with soft hands before setting off for one. He is turned back immediately by Morgan when he sees Clarke advancing on it, who picks it up and fires in a throw which has Bell diving for safety, but the bat bounces off the pitch as he looks to ground it. The throw beats Bell's dive handsomely, and just like that Bell is gone for a well-fought 68;Ian Bell run out (Clarke) 68 (122m 84b 5x4 0x6) SR: 80.95;

28.6;?;Johnson to Bell, no run finishes well as this back of a length delivery into the ribs is played back to the bowler;

18.3;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run turned away to square leg for a single;
18.3;2nb;Clarke to Morgan, (no ball) 1 run down the track and Morgan figures he has got a handle on the pitch as he looks to clear midwicket with a big hit, but instead gets this to go higher than farther, with deep midwicket steadying himself under it to take the catch. Morgan has made an inquiry with the umpire about the fact that there are too many fielders outside of the circle. Currently verifying if this is indeed the case. And would you believe it, he is correct. The umpire reverses the signal and now calls for a no-ball. Can't recall the last time that happened to be honest;
18.2;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run advances down the track to this tossed up delivery, with Bell looking to hit through mid-off, but instead hits it straight back to Clarke, who gets a touch on it as it just misses the non-striker's stumps, with Morgan backing up a bit too much, and was well short of his ground;
18.1;?;Clarke to Bell, no run defended away to the off side by Bell;
17.6;1;Maxwell to Bell, 1 run works this one off the pads to bring the over to an end;

17.3;?;Maxwell to Morgan, no run lets the keeper collect this one as it spins away from the bat;
17.2;W;Maxwell to Ballance, OUT and Maxwell beats an increasingly fidgety Ballance as he lofts one just around off stump, with the flight drawing Ballance down the track before the left-hander, trying to work this leg side, misses the ball completely, and turns around just in time to see Haddin collect the ball and whip the bails off. Maxwell strikes again and suddenly England seemed to have lost their way at 78 for 3;Gary Ballance st ?Haddin b Maxwell 9 (17m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 47.36;

16.6;1;Clarke to Ballance, 1 run played off the back foot as this is worked away to backward square for a single;
16.5;?;Clarke to Ballance, no run once again played to the same man as Ballance is itching for a single;
16.4;?;Clarke to Ballance, no run played to the off side, but no run on offer;
16.3;?;Clarke to Ballance, no run this time looking to get past silly mid-on, but the fielder is equal to the task;
16.2;?;Clarke to Ballance, no run looks for the gap through the off side, but finds the fielder;
16.1;?;Clarke to Ballance, no run bowls one on a length which is defended to the leg side;

15.1;1;Maxwell to Ballance, 1 run turns this one to the leg side for a single;
14.6;2;Clarke to Bell, 2 runs tossed up wide of off, Bell was advancing and had to adjust for the width and turn, did well in the end to steer through point and pick up a couple of runs;
14.5;1;Clarke to Ballance, 1 run driven through midwicket for another single;
14.4;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run Bell uses the feet now and just drives a safe single down to long-on;
14.3;1;Clarke to Ballance, 1 run Clarke is tossing this up, slowly, and Ballance drives down through mid-on;
14.2;?;Clarke to Ballance, no run on the back foot, crunched to short cover;
14.1;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run nearly strikes immediately! Tossed up outside off and Bell pushes at it, the inside edge just misses the stumps!;

13.2;?;Maxwell to Ballance, no run very full from Maxwell, Ballance drives at it but mistimes it towards short cover;
13.1;1;Maxwell to Bell, 1 run tossed up on the stumps from around the wicket, Bell now with two partners gone is happy to just work this through midwicket;
12.6;?;Johnson to Ballance, no run shortish at 142kph but it's outside off, so Ballance isn't in danger - though he dabbed the bat at it perhaps unnecessarily;
12.6;1w;Johnson to Ballance, 1 wide swings this one down leg;
12.5;W;Johnson to Root, OUT Johnson gets Root! It seemed inevitable, and it's an lbw that gets him. Johnson gets this one to swing back in a fraction, at pace, and the only thing as slow as Root's attempt to get the bat down in time is Dharmasena's delayed decision to give that out. As he did in the first ODI, Root wants a review and as was the case then, he is still out. It was an umpire's call, replays suggesting it would have hit the leg bail. Really ungainly shot by Root, who just couldn't handle the pace;Joe Root lbw b Johnson 2 (8m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
12.4;?;Johnson to Root, no run again shouts of "catch it!" as Root drives at a fullish Johnson ball and lobs it up short of point;
12.3;?;Johnson to Root, no run uppishly driven, very uppishly driven towards mid-off and Root is fortunate he didn't get a fraction more on that as it's bounced just short of the fielder;
12.2;?;Johnson to Root, no run accurate at 143kph and Root defends;
12.1;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run soft hands from Bell as he just guides this one through square leg for a single;

11.5;?;Maxwell to Root, no run driven down towards mid-on;
11.4;2;Maxwell to Root, 2 runs Root is a touch lucky here, gets it away fine off the toe of the bat to get himself off the mark;
11.3;?;Maxwell to Root, no run Root drives but can't beat point - there's a really tight field inside the ring to try to keep Root on strike;
11.2;W;Maxwell to Cook, OUT Maxwell strikes! Around the wicket to Cook, who drives at a half-volley but does nothing more than send it back in the direction of the bowler, who takes a sharp catch low to his right.

10.5;?;Faulkner to Bell, no run fuller on the pads, Bell pushes to leg;

9.3;1w;McKay to Bell, 1 wide horribly wide of off now, McKay has done this a few times today, just squirting it far too wide;
9.2;?;McKay to Bell, no run Bell walks down the pitch, keen to get the scoreboard moving further, McKay drags the length back and makes Bell defend;

8.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run defended towards the off side;
7.6;4;McKay to Cook, FOUR runs poor ball, short and down leg side and all Cook had to do was help this on its way to fine leg - which he did. McKay is chastising himself at that delivery;
7.5;?;McKay to Cook, no run McKay hurls this one down with a Sharapova-like grunt, Cook nudges off the pads to midwicket;
7.4;?;McKay to Cook, no run cuts hard into the turf and straight to point;

6.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run defended towards the off side now;
6.5;2;Coulter-Nile to Bell, 2 runs and wouldn't you know it, a slip comes out and Bell edges this one through the new gap, though angled it down so it wasn't really catchable height - third man collects;
6.4;4;Coulter-Nile to Bell, FOUR runs Bell picks up a boundary this time, nice attractive shot too as he clips off his pads wide of mid-on and although it was uppishly struck it was safe, lovely placement;
6.3;3;Coulter-Nile to Cook, 3 runs now Cook is taking on Coulter-Nile, too, with a lovely cover drive that is chased down by McKay with a sliding save on the boundary;
6.2;3;Coulter-Nile to Bell, 3 runs width from Coulter-Nile and Bell is keen to go after him, throws the bat at this and lobs him over cover but the ball pulls up well inside the boundary;

5.6;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run fuller from Johnson and that allows Bell to play that late cut that he enjoys, just steers this safely along the ground to third man;
5.5;?;Johnson to Bell, no run nearly played on! Bell defends outside off and this skews off the inside edge just past the stumps - that was close!;
5.4;?;Johnson to Bell, no run Bell drives hard again, this time along the ground and straight to mid-off;
5.3;4;Johnson to Bell, FOUR runs Bell has had enough of waiting around, he flashes outside off and crunches Johnson uppishly through cover for his first boundary;
5.2;?;Johnson to Bell, no run bouncer, nice and accurate too but Bell is keen to play, tries to sway back and steer it over the cordon but doesn't connect - Johnson is interested in a caught behind appeal but Haddin isn't;

3.3;1;Johnson to Cook, 1 run steered away towards fine leg and Faulkner does the fielding;
3.2;4;Johnson to Cook, FOUR runs Cook picks up the first boundary of the innings, just a casual sort of flick through square leg as Johnson gives him one on middle and leg;
3.1;?;Johnson to Cook, no run again Johnson beats Cook outside off! Really had him squared up here, angled in towards off and just straightening enough, Cook's feet go nowhere and he's lucky not to edge this;
2.6;1;McKay to Cook, 1 run on the pads now and Cook flicks it away towards fine leg, just ticking the scoreboard over gently at this stage;
2.5;?;McKay to Cook, no run Cook is defending off the back foot now;
2.4;1lb;McKay to Bell, 1 leg bye worked away to the leg side;
2.3;?;McKay to Bell, no run a shout from the Australians here as this one swings down leg and Bell goes for a glance, Haddin makes a diving take. Umpire Dharmasena says not out, but also doesn't signal wide, indicating perhaps that was off thigh pad. Replays suggest it may have missed everything - McKay probably lucky that wasn't called wide;
2.2;?;McKay to Bell, no run Bell leans out to defend once more, he's making a watchful start;
2.1;?;McKay to Bell, no run McKay moves this in to the right-hander Bell, who defends;
1.6;?;Johnson to Cook, no run this one swings in just a touch and Cook defends solidly towards off;
1.5;2;Johnson to Cook, 2 runs Cook gets some width now and it's a touch shorter, he's happy to punch this through cover and pick up a couple more runs;
1.4;?;Johnson to Cook, no run Johnson goes fuller, aiming for the yorker at 146kph, but it's not quite full enough for a yorker and Cook pushes to leg;
1.3;?;Johnson to Cook, no run outside off stump again and this one Cook leaves alone;
1.2;?;Johnson to Cook, no run beaten outside off! Lovely delivery, just moves away enough to beat the bat of Cook, who was dabbing at this;
1.2;1w;Johnson to Cook, 1 wide and Johnson now finds what McKay has already discovered - it ain't easy controlling this swing. This one curves well wide of off and almost to first slip. Wide signalled by umpire John Ward, who is on his ODI debut;
1.1;?;Johnson to Cook, no run accurate immediately at 140kph, Cook defends this from off stump;

0.1;1;McKay to Cook, 1 run Cook starts with a cut, gets it away to third man for a single;

Hello all, welcome to the second ODI at the Gabba. The news from the middle is that England have won the toss and will bat. They have also gone in with an unchanged side from the Melbourne ODI, despite the loss there. A win against the Prime Minister's XI might just have given them a little of the confidence that has been lacking.
Australia have made two changes. Xavier Doherty has been dropped to make room for Mitchell Johnson, who had a rest from the first game. And Shane Watson is also taking a break - his place has been taken by Shaun Marsh. So Glenn Maxwell will be the main spinner for Australia today.
Here are those teams:
Australia 1 Aaron Finch, 2 David Warner, 3 Shaun Marsh, 4 Michael Clarke, 5 George Bailey, 6 Glenn Maxwell, 7 Brad Haddin, 8 James Faulkner, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Nathan Coulter-Nile, 11 Clint McKay.
England 1 Alastair Cook, 2 Ian Bell, 3 Joe Root, 4 Gary Ballance, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Jos Buttler, 8 Ben Stokes, 9 Tim Bresnan, 10 Chris Jordan, 11 Boyd Rankin.
Brydon Coverdale here with you for the start of this match, we'll be joined later on by Rohan Sharma. The return of Mitch Johnson adds a little intrigue to this match - will he maintain the kind of pace and threat he did in the Tests? Pony thinks so: "England to bat first, Johnson must be licking his mustache. Sorry, I mean lips."
DJ: "Cant believe Root is still at no3. He can't hit the ball of the square at the moment. Between him and his captain there are two walking wickets right there."
Cam: "No doubt that Root is talented but he is in a bad rut at the moment. If he has another poor game today do England stick with him or give him a bit of a break?"
Jazz: "What was that definition of insanity again?? I can only hope both Cook & Root have been supported with a free licence to try and hit themselves out of their respective holes. Building a launching pad is all well and good when it works, but wasting this first powerplay again will make it almost impossible for the middle order. C'mon England!!!"
The weather is fine in Brisbane at the moment, all is set for play to begin shortly. A couple of people have asked on feedback why Australia haven't picked James Pattinson. I can only assume they want to ease him back slowly, perhaps later in the series. But it would be good to see him bowl more than four overs in a T20 with the South African tour coming up.
Time for the action to begin, it's Clint McKay with the first new ball at the Vulture Street End...
 Innings Start
Have you returned yet from the clouds? What a win this was for Australia as Faulkner proved that the Mohali heist was not a one-off. Can't recall a greater eruption from an Australian crowd in recent years. England will be slightly shell-shocked by what has just transpired, but they will need to pick themselves up by the straps and get mentally ready for the 3rd ODI, which will be played in Sydney in two days' time. Till then, this is Rohan Sharma signing off for ESPNcricinfo on behalf of fellow commentator, Brydon Coverdale, and scorer, Venkat Raghav.
Michael Clarke, Australian captain: I have seen James do it once before. I watched it on TV in India when he won that. I think he will be disappointed he didn't take it to the last ball, but what an unbelievable innings. I thought none of our top four could go on to make a hundred, but we knew we had a strong batting unit, and Mitch batted at No.10, but Faulkner was just striking it so well. Maxy did well and his good, positive intent set up the game for us. It's nice to play with confidence and to know within that they can win games of cricket no matter what, but like we have said England are a strong team, and we have to play better than tonight in order to win the series. It's exciting for the game. New young players are coming in and stepping up to win us games. Faulkner deserves all the credit in the world.
James Faulkner, Man of the Match: Thanks for everyone coming out today and glad we could put on a good show and get an Australian win. When you bat lower down the order you have to try and get the team home. It is all about winning games for your country. I might look like I am calm, but deep down I am pretty nervous. It is a special night, and it is always good when Australia wins. Yeah those sixes are up there with some of the best I have hit. Just happy to get the win. This is definitely the ultimate moment. To win like this is something special.
Alastair Cook, England captain: It took an unbelievable innings to beat us today. I thought Morgs played exceptional well, and we did everything right till the last wicket. James played an astonishing innings and took it as deep as he dared. Its an emotional dressing room now, but when we look at it tomorrow morning we will see we did a lot of good things, but the last few overs were not so good. Proud of the way the lads stuck in, but we couldn't pull it off unfortunately. We showed how close we were today, and like I said it took an amazing innings to beat us.
I have only ever seen this for a player's last match or when they play a truly special innings, and I guess the latter can describe Faulkner's knock as he is given a guard of honour by the Australian players and backroom staff. The Gabba has simply taken off over these last few minutes. Australia simply can not lose it seems.
Glenn Maxwell: Well Faulkner has done it before in India. I don't know how to describe it, that was incredible. The way Jimmy was playing we had every chance. He was defending balls, taking ones, not taking ones, he was just exceptional. Yeah it was nice to show our depth tonight, so hopefully the top order gets in form the next game and do the job for us.
James Faulkner: It is unbelievable. Look we are here to win so thanks to everyone who came out. Yea it was looking that way at one point, but the middle order batted well exceptionally as we were able to pull off the victory. We only had one wicket left, and with Mitch's experience he was trying to talk me through it. I knew I could do it deep down but it is always good to get it done on the day. Tried to hit it out of the park. Everyone was nervous and McKay has a beautiful forward defence so everyone did their job.
Faulkner jumps in celebration as the Australians have pulled off an impressive heist here in Brisbane. Faulkner is proving to be a really valuable commodity for Australia of late, especially with the bat in hand. This has to go down as one of the all-time great Australia-England matches. The England fielders are in shock and Michael Slater is saluting Faulkner.
49.3;4;Bresnan to Faulkner, FOUR runs able to find the gap on the off side as he backs away to squirt this away through extra-cover, beating the fielder near the 30-yard circle, as this travels to the rope, sparking off scenes of delirium across the Gabba;
49.2;4;Bresnan to Faulkner, FOUR runs sees this one early as Faulkner readies himself to this shorter one just outside off, before pulling this magnificently to midwicket for a one-bounce four which bifurcates the two fielders on the leg side;
49.1;4;Bresnan to Faulkner, FOUR runs tries a slower bouncer which Faulkner is too early on as the ball runs off the face, and bounces over the keeper's outstretched gloves to the third man rope. Australia now need 8 off 5;
48.6;1;Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run fires it in on the blockhole as Faulkner eases this one down to long-on for a single, and more importantly for Australia, retain the striek;
48.5;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run third time not so lucky for Faulkner as clearly the adrenaline is getting to him now. Is lucky not to get bowled as this goes down the leg stump to the keeper;
48.4;6;Stokes to Faulkner, SIX runs in the slot and suddenly images of Ishant start to come to the surface as Faulkner clears his front leg, and then clears the long-on boundary with another easy swing of the bat. This is sensational hitting from the Tasmanian allrounder;
48.3;6;Stokes to Faulkner, SIX runs back of a length and just crunched over the midwicket boundary for a huge six. Such a clean swing of the blade as this one just rises and rises into the stands;
48.2;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run gets in a yorker on middle and leg which Faulkner is able to dig out successfully;
48.1;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run this one was heading down the pads as Faulkner decides to go with it and hit over cow corner, but gets a bit too early into the shot, with the ball falling safely to his right;
47.6;?;Bresnan to McKay, no run decides to fire in a bouncer which for all intensive purposes should have been called a wide by the third umpire, but Dharmasena just walks away from the spot. England lucky to get away with that one;
47.5;1;Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run once again negotiates this shortish length slower ball to the leg side for a single;
47.4;2;Bresnan to Faulkner, 2 runs on the back foot as this is pulled down to deep midwicket, with the pair running for their lives as they are able to scamper back for the second, and beat the incoming throw from the deep at the keeper's end;
47.3;2;Bresnan to Faulkner, 2 runs angling down the pads as this is helped off the hips by Faulkner, who is able to make it back for two;
47.2;?;Bresnan to Faulkner, no run another short slower ball which ends up being played back to th ebowler;
47.1;?;Bresnan to Faulkner, no run slower ball outside off which is played tentatively towards point;
46.6;1;Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run again they are able to squirt this behind down to third man, but are kept to just one;
46.5;6;Stokes to Faulkner, SIX runs dropped back of a length and this is all Faulkner needed as he goes after this with a pull shot. Root, running in from deep square leg, is able to get a hand on it before the boundary, but the momentum carries him over, ends up being called a six by the third umpire. Root really deserved that one as he was in control, but unfortunately cost his side two extra runs at the least;
46.4;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run bludgeons this with his rendition of Dhoni's helicopter, but this one unfortunately finds mid-off;
46.3;2;Stokes to Faulkner, 2 runs able to squirt this full and wide one behind to third man, but can't beat the fielder. Still gains two valuable runs for his team;
46.2;1;Stokes to McKay, 1 run swinging into the pads as this is eased down to long-on;
46.1;1;Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run fires in a fuller one which is worked down to the fielder at long-off;
45.6;?;Bresnan to McKay, no run tries to run this down to the man at third man, but hits it more square than fine as the over comes to an end;
45.5;1;Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run Bresnan surprises him with a full toss on the hips which is helped down to the man at deep fine leg for a single;
45.4;1;Bresnan to McKay, 1 run short delivery on the off stump, McKay pulls it to deep mid-wicket;
45.3;?;Bresnan to McKay, no run drills this length ball straight to silly mid-off;
45.2;?;Bresnan to McKay, no run short ball just outside off which is defended off the back foot to the off side;
45.1;1;Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run length outside off which is pushed to the covers;
44.6;?;Stokes to McKay, no run just plays this one to the fielder at cover, but doesn't want the run, as Faulkner will be back on strike next over;
44.5;?;Stokes to McKay, no run McKay gets forward to this length ball on and around off;
44.4;?;Stokes to McKay, no run length coming in as this one is inside-edged onto the pad, with Stokes thinking he has got his man;
44.3;1;Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run pitches this up as Faulkner is able to get it down to long-on for a single. This leaves McKay exposed at the other end, but he too can hit a long ball;
44.2;6;Stokes to Faulkner, SIX runs Faulkner has stepped up a few gears as he just whacks this short one well over the square leg boundary for a huge six;
44.1;6;Stokes to Faulkner, SIX runs and Faulkner has decided it is time to go as he deposits this length ball straight into the midwicket stand;
43.6;W;Bopara to Johnson, OUT and Bopara picks up a wicket as he has Johnson going after this length ball outside off, with a gentle push which catches a faint outside edge to the keeper behind. Leaves England just one wicket away from squaring the series after two;Mitchell Johnson c ?Buttler b Bopara 1 (12m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10;
43.6;1w;Bopara to Johnson, 1 wide again down the same line, but a tad wider;
43.5;?;Bopara to Johnson, no run pitches wide outside off as he looks to engineer a reverse-scoop over fine leg, but can't get a connection on it;
43.4;1;Bopara to Faulkner, 1 run squirts this one through point for a single to sweeper cover;
43.3;?;Bopara to Faulkner, no run back of a length outside off which is punched straight to the covers;
43.2;1;Bopara to Johnson, 1 run low full toss which is angled to the off side, beating a diving silly mid-on, before being recovered by long-on;
43.1;1;Bopara to Faulkner, 1 run length going down the pads as this is worked down to long-on;
42.6;?;Stokes to Johnson, no run tries a slower one on a length which Johnson reads late as this goes harmlessly past the bat to the keeper;

41.5;?;Bopara to Johnson, no run back of a length and straight as Johnson just plays this to the leg side;
41.4;?;Bopara to Johnson, no run tries to get away a fuller one to the leg side, but silly mid-on is all over it;

41.2;1;Bopara to Faulkner, 1 run low full toss just outside off as this is played straight to long-on;
41.1;?;Bopara to Faulkner, no run defends this one tentatively to the off side;
40.6;W;Stokes to Coulter-Nile, OUT gets one to swing in from just outside off as Nathan goes for the big heave down the ground, but misses the ball as this careens low into his right pad, which is definitely in line of the stumps. Doesn't look to have got an inside-edge as this one continued onto the pads, so fairplay to the Australians for not wasting the review;Nathan Coulter-Nile lbw b Stokes 16 (28m 23b 0x4 1x6) SR: 69.56;
40.5;?;Stokes to Coulter-Nile, no run fires in a leg side yorker which Nathan fails to get away. Really should have done better with this one;
40.4;?;Stokes to Coulter-Nile, no run ends up playing this reverse-swinging delivery back to the bowler;
40.3;?;Stokes to Coulter-Nile, no run swinging down the pads as Nathan tries to get this fine down the leg side, but the keeper does well to get behind it;

40.1;1;Stokes to Coulter-Nile, 1 run another pull shot to the man at fine leg as Nathan continues to believe Australia can pull through;

38.6;1;Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run once again slanting down the pads as Faulkner helps this off his hops for a single;

38.4;?;Stokes to Coulter-Nile, no run going down the leg side again as this time the ball strikes the pads;
38.3;1;Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run plays this softly to the man at point as they embark on a quick single, but the throw would have had the non-striker run out by miles. Morgan, after firing in the throw, grabs hold of his right knee. Hopefully he hasn't done himself in there;

37.4;1;Bopara to Coulter-Nile, 1 run slower ball which is helped to square leg;
37.3;?;Bopara to Coulter-Nile, no run speared in on middle and off as Nathan does well to dig it out;

36.6;2;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs tried to pull again, but got a top-edge to third man for a couple;
36.5;6;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs Nathan plays the most flukey hook I have ever seen as he commits early to this short of a length delivery which flies high over fine leg, with the fielder running it down, before realising it was going over;
36.4;2;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs back of a length and pulled down to deep midwicket;
36.3;1;Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run shortish length outside off which is cut towards backward point, but can't get past the fielder;

35.1;1w;Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 wide going down the leg side as this is left alone by the batsman;
34.6;?;Bresnan to Faulkner, no run pushed away to point;
34.5;W;Bresnan to Maxwell, OUT but that's the end of Maxwell! He's pulled straight to midwicket and Bopara takes the catch. Two key wickets in the over, and are Australia's chances over as well?;Glenn Maxwell c Bopara b Bresnan 54 (56m 39b 8x4 0x6) SR: 138.46;
34.4;4;Bresnan to Maxwell, FOUR runs Maxwell is now reversing the hook off a fast bowler! And it's worked, he's got this away for a boundary towards third man;
34.3;1lb;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye Coulter-Nile swings hard and can't get it away but they hurry through for a tight leg bye;
34.2;1;Bresnan to Maxwell, 1 run plays with soft hands to the off side as Maxwell brings up a well-played fifty. Australia will hope he can continue on longer;
34.1;W;Bresnan to Haddin, OUT no, it won't be Haddin who rescues Australia! Bresnan has got him, extra bounce did the trick as Haddin tried to slam this down the ground and top-edged it up towards mid-off and Cook was steady under the ball to take the catch;Brad Haddin c Cook b Bresnan 26 (46m 35b 2x4 0x6) SR: 74.28;
33.6;1;Jordan to Haddin, 1 run down leg and Haddin works it away behind square;
33.5;4;Jordan to Haddin, FOUR runs super shot! Haddin may just be capable of rescuing Australia as he did in the Tests! He's just lifted this over extra cover and there's no man out there so if he hits it cleanly - as he did - it's a safe shot for four;
33.4;4;Jordan to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin finds the off-side boundary now as Jordan gives him something short and wide, Haddin crunches a cut through cover point;
33.3;2;Jordan to Haddin, 2 runs clipped away through midwicket for another couple of runs;
33.2;?;Jordan to Haddin, no run Jordan angles this in and targets the stumps - almost gets through Haddin's defences. Actually, defences is the wrong word as he was trying a slog over leg;
33.1;1lb;Jordan to Maxwell, 1 leg bye leg bye is all that Maxwell can manage as Jordan aims at the leg-stump;
32.6;?;Bresnan to Haddin, no run driven down to mid-off but too hard - means they can't take the single;
32.5;2;Bresnan to Haddin, 2 runs shortish and Haddin pulls through square leg;
32.4;?;Bresnan to Haddin, no run Haddin tries to force through cover but can't find the gap;

32.2;4;Bresnan to Maxwell, FOUR runs good timing from Maxwell, albeit from a poor delivery - low full toss just a touch down leg and Maxwell helps it on its way behind fine leg. Almost a yorker - almost, but not quite;
32.1;1;Bresnan to Haddin, 1 run Haddin starts the powerplay sedately enough, just a nudged single to mid-off;
31.6;?;Bopara to Maxwell, no run defended back down the pitch;
31.5;4;Bopara to Maxwell, FOUR runs Maxwell gets another boundary through the backward point area but not with a reverse shot this time - it's just a really well placed late cut;

30.6;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run shorter of length and this one Maxwell can't get away;
30.5;4;Jordan to Maxwell, FOUR runs that's some intent from Maxwell! He has advanced and flat-batted this with muscle and power past mid-off for a boundary;
30.4;2;Jordan to Maxwell, 2 runs Maxwell opens the face and steers this behind point for a single to third man;
30.3;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run Maxwell goes the big swipe to a short ball and can't beat midwicket;
30.2;2lb;Jordan to Maxwell, 2 leg byes nice ball from Jordan that nips back in off the seam and Maxwell tries to steer it to third man, but it nips in so much it strikes him on the thigh pad - Jordan asks the lbw question but it looked high;
30.1;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run Maxwell takes a big swing at this on off stump and just edges it back onto the pads;
30.1;1w;Jordan to Maxwell, 1 wide banged in short and down leg side, so that's a wide;
29.6;1;Root to Maxwell, 1 run full toss from Root and Maxwell can't put it away, just gets a single to deep midwicket;
29.5;?;Root to Maxwell, no run pushed away uppishly into the leg side;
29.4;?;Root to Maxwell, no run tries again but this one was quicker from Root and Maxwell didn't get hold of it;
29.3;4;Root to Maxwell, FOUR runs he's tried it again from a full toss and this is four more! This one runs finer and there is nothing England can do to stop it;
29.2;4;Root to Maxwell, FOUR runs once again Maxwell picks the gap behind backward point with a reverse sweep - how does Cook stop that?;

28.6;1;Jordan to Maxwell, 1 run Maxwell gets a shortish one on leg and pulls it around to fine leg;
28.5;1;Jordan to Haddin, 1 run Haddin swings hard again and again doesn't time it through midwicket;

26.5;2;Jordan to Maxwell, 2 runs Jordan gives Maxwell some width and Maxwell drives into the turf and through cover;

25.5;?;Root to Maxwell, no run pushed away to the leg side;
25.4;4;Root to Maxwell, FOUR runs Maxwell gets adventurous now and it works! He's gone for the reverse ... hmm, sweep, I suppose, but it's more of a swipe that just clears square leg and runs away to the boundary;
25.3;?;Root to Maxwell, no run pushed away to cover but can't find the gap;
25.2;1;Root to Haddin, 1 run Haddin drives for an easy single to long-on;

24.5;?;Rankin to Haddin, no run solidly defended by Haddin;
24.4;?;Rankin to Haddin, no run beaten outside off, Rankin follows the shorter ones with a fuller ball that draws Haddin out and he can't get bat on ball;

24.1;1;Rankin to Maxwell, 1 run nudged away for a quick single towards mid-on;
24.1;1w;Rankin to Maxwell, 1 wide wrong line from Rankin now, this one skews down leg side and is unquestionably a wide;

23.1;1;Root to Maxwell, 1 run Maxwell pushes uppishly and shouts from the fielders as this lands just safely wide of midwicket;
22.6;W;Rankin to Bailey, OUT Rankin strikes and that's pretty much dead plumb lbw. Angled in and Bailey doesn't move the feet, misses the ball and is struck directly in front. Dharmasena gives it out and that's one of the easier calls he'll have to make in his career;George Bailey lbw b Rankin 24 (37m 28b 0x4 0x6) SR: 85.71;
22.5;?;Rankin to Bailey, no run accurate from Rankin, Bailey goes back and tries to work to leg but only gets it back to the bowler;

22.3;?;Rankin to Maxwell, no run Maxwell opens the face and tries to steer this to third man - there's a slip in place so it's risky, but he doesn't make contact at all;
22.2;1;Rankin to Bailey, 1 run Bailey swivels on his toes and pulls through square to keep the scoreboard ticking, but there's a lot of ticking required now;
22.1;1;Rankin to Maxwell, 1 run Rankin angles this in towards the pads of Maxwell, who flicks through square leg;

21.5;1;Root to Maxwell, 1 run nudged away through leg to get off the mark;
21.4;W;Root to Marsh, OUT Root strikes again! And it's a huge wicket, it's the established Shaun Marsh who goes back to try a cut but the ball is too straight and skids through to clip the off stump. What a strike for Root - he's got two!;Shaun Marsh b Root 55 (79m 69b 7x4 0x6) SR: 79.71;
21.3;1;Root to Bailey, 1 run another run to the man in the deep on the leg side;

17.2;1lb;Root to Bailey, 1 leg bye Bailey goes for the sweep on a fullish ball and misses, there's half an lbw shout but that looked to be pitching outside leg from the angle;
17.1;?;Root to Bailey, no run Root is around the wicket to Bailey, who uses the feet and pushes to off;
16.6;1;Stokes to Bailey, 1 run Stokes tests Bailey in that avenue outside off that troubled him in the Tests, and a thickish edge runs away past slip to third man;
16.5;1;Stokes to Marsh, 1 run swivels a pull through square leg now;

14.3;?;Bresnan to Marsh, no run Bresnan strikes Marsh on the pads as the bowler goes up for an appeal. Dharmasena is not interested though, and after a brief consultation, they decide to go for the review. The review shows that this is definitely pitching outside leg though, so in turns out be a dud review for England. Oh well;

We are back live at the Gabba. It will be Rankin to bowl to Warner. And during the break the match officials have made a correction to England's score. It's up to 300 and Buttler's score is now 49. That's because the ball at 47.2, when Shaun Marsh stepped outside the boundary and knocked the ball back in play, was not called a six when it should have been. The officials have now rectified that.
