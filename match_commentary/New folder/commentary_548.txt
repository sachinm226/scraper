Data
Australia have succumbed to pace here. Both Steyn and Parnel were lethal in the early spell and returned to clean up the tail in fairly quick time. The tables seem to have turned after that mauling in Durban, though the job is yet to be completed. There was a time in the Australian innings where they did pull off a short-lived recovery with Johnson and Ferguson tackling the spinners well to take their team past three figures but once the doosra separated them, it didn't take too long for the fast bowlers to wrap things up.
Join us in about ten minutes for the start of the run-chase, given that the visitors have been bowled out well ahead of the closing time for the first innings.

Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the second ODI between Australia and South Africa being played in Centurion. The news is that Australia have won the toss and opted to bat. The pitch looks dry and the sun is beating down hard, so we may well be in store for a high-scoring match. Australia have retained the same side.
Graeme Smith is hoping the pitch lasts the day, which recent history at the ground shows that it normally does. Three changes for South Africa - Jacques Kallis comes back in, and is joined by Wayne Parnell and Roelof van de Merwe, who'll be making his ODI debut. So Amla, Morne Morkel and Ntini are out. There's a while before the start, around 20 minutes, so you can read the preview to the game in the meantime.
The players are out for the national anthems and the near-capacity crowd is up on its feet. The umpires, Brian Jerling and Asoka de Silva, are now making their way out, and the players follow. Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin to open. Dale Steyn to start proceedings for South Africa. All set!
 Innings Start
A clinical win for South Africa who've returned the favour after that massive defeat in Durban. Parnell and Steyn did it for them, and their batsmen saw off the target with little difficulty. The series is now level 1-1, and we move to Cape Town for the third ODI on April 9. Do stay tuned in, we'll get you the presentation details very soon.
Ponting: "You've seen the best and the worst of us for the last couple of days. South Africa bowled very well at the start and that set up the game for them. We've got some work to do top of the order. We've got a few days before the next game to rectify that. Parnell bowled very well, got it to come back in and bowled at a good pace. We need a bit more consistency at the top."
Wayne Parnell is the Man of the Match, in just his second ODI.
Parnell: "I'm very happy and it was a good outing for South Africa. I think its probably the best opening spells I've bowled. Michael Hussey was my favourite wicket, and it was good to get him because he whacked me around a little in Brisbane."
Smith: "We weren't good enough Friday night, but we came back well today. The bowlers did a very good job, particularly Parnell and Steyn. We bowled with good intensity and the batsmen got a bit of practice as well. We made a slight tactical change in bringing in Parnell and it paid off. It was a great wicket out there and Centurion is a wonderful place to play."
That's all from here folks. Thanks for tuning in and sending your feedback. Do read Brydon Coverdale's bulletin here before logging off. Until Cape Town, it's goodbye from all of us here at Cricinfo. Adios!
