5.45pm: Well, it's hard to know what to make of that score. Three-hundred used to be considered challenging, then came the shift - and New Zealand comfortably chased a very similar score on this ground three months ago. But now, with no batting Powerplay and an extra man outside the ring for the final ten, 300 might well be a stiff target once again. We'll find out soon enough but, however you cut it, England have only chased this much twice before.
"You all are wrong," declares James. "England played well against the Black Caps because they lacked bowlers who can bowl well on a flat track, but Starc will be too much for the English batsmen. This is my 43rd post and none published. Thank you." No, thank you, James. We'll be back in 30...

31.4;2;Wood to Bailey, 2 runs pulls a short-of-a-length delivery from outside off to long leg;
31.3;1;Wood to Maxwell, 1 run angled into leg stump, Maxwell gets inside the line and tucks to long leg;
31.2;?;Wood to Maxwell, no run fuller ball, at off stump, 87mph and drives firmly to mid-off;
31.1;4;Wood to Maxwell, FOUR runs what a fantastic piece of timing first ball, a back-of-a-length delivery outside off and Maxwell elegantly drives it off the back foot through the covers and wide of the sweeper. Superb.;
30.6;W;Rashid to Smith, OUT another full toss, another wicket! Would you believe it! Smith is furious with himself. Was a juicy full toss, Smith was aiming to clear the deep midwicket boundary but couldn't get it wide, or over, Ben Stokes.

29.4;2;Wood to Smith, 2 runs driven square through the off side, more good running;
29.3;4;Wood to Smith, FOUR runs edged through the vacant slip cordon and Finn can't cut it off at third man...an odd shot from Smith, trying to work a pretty wide ball through the leg side. Well, I say odd. Probably quite normal for him;

29.1;?;Wood to Smith, no run full at off stump, 84mph, defended firmly to cover;

26.3;?;Rashid to Bailey, no run on the stumps, pushed to the off side;
26.2;W;Rashid to Warner, OUT he's got the breakthrough again! Credit to Morgan, as well as Rashid.

13.6;1;Woakes to Burns, 1 run short again, over the stumps and pulled down to fine leg;
13.5;?;Woakes to Burns, no run Burns advances down the pitch early and Woakes spots it and bounces him, well directed and he has to pull out of his stroke, jerking his head away to the left as the ball flies through;

11.6;?;Woakes to Warner, no run well bowled, back of a length and Warner has to ride it, steered to backward point - just one off the over;
11.5;?;Woakes to Warner, no run tight lines, Warner sits in the crease and defends;

6.1;?;Finn to Burns, no run around the line of off, length delivery, Burns taps it square;

"Strike rotation hasn't been good so far. The increasing pressure therefore may lead to a wicket," prognosticates Sudip
 Innings Start
Australia win by 59 runs and that's a performance notable for two impressive fightbacks: firstly from 193 for 6, when Matthew Wade and Mitch Marsh added 112, then when England were 152 for 2. Shane Watson removed James Taylor and the middle couldn't get going today. Mitchell Starc was impressive in his latter spells, well supported by Nathan Coulter-Nile and Pat Cummins. England should think back and consider this as a chance that slipped away from those two strong positions. But it's a five-match series so time to hit back. They have a few questions to ask over the death bowling, but there is no need for Trevor Bayliss and Eoin Morgan to panic. A developing side will have days like this. Australia, although with some new faces, showed why they are world champions. I'll bring you the presentation shortly.
Eoin Morgan "Australia bowled well in the 10-15 overs in the middle of the chase. I thought they defended pretty well, but we are a better side than that. You can always do things differently, we will look at our plans and try to improve for Lord's. It is frustrating but I don't want to take anything away from the way the guys play naturally. Australia are a very strong side and we'll have to play well. Today was an opportunity which we missed."
Steven Smith "Nice to be on that side of the draw, thought the boys played very nice. To score 93 off the last 10 was a good effort. The pitch was a little two paced when the ball got holder. Thought Joe Burns has looked nice, Davey Warner is a class act. Hopefully the middle order can support them. This sort of attack has done really well for us, we are No. 1 in the world. You have to sum up conditions in each match. Matt played some very smart cricket to get us to 305."
No surprise that the Man of the Match is Matthew Wade. "Really happy with the start. I was feeling pretty pad when I wan Watto out, so knew I had to take it as deep as I could. I didn't know what a good total would be, allowing Mitch to take the bowlers on. Thought we were 10-15 under but we bowled really well. It's great to be back, feel I've played well in one-day cricket."
And that just about wraps things up for today. Australia take the early lead in the series. It's a quick turnaround. We are back on Saturday for the Lord's match. See you then. From Gnasher and Alan it's goodnight.

41.1;1;Cummins to Wood, 1 run full, 90mph, Wood pushes it down the ground;

40.5;1;Starc to Wood, 1 run full and straight, more movement late at the batsman, Wood somehow works it through cover;

39.6;2;Cummins to Ali, 2 runs just over cover, Moeen driving on the up again outside off;

39.3;4;Cummins to Ali, FOUR runs another flowing drive from Moeen, this was a back-of-a-length delivery but he struck through the line and send it straight down the ground;

37.5;?;Watson to Rashid, no run driven to backward point;

37.3;?;Watson to Rashid, no run tries to angle a straight delivery into an off-side gap but finds point;
37.2;1;Watson to Ali, 1 run opens the face and places this through the off side...200 up for England, but a lot of damage done of late;

36.2;W;Coulter-Nile to Woakes, OUT he's on a hat-trick! Short, angled down the leg side, Woakes goes for a paddle-turned-pull and gets a very thin glove through to Wade. One glove down the leg side can be unlucky, but two in four balls?;Chris Woakes c ?Wade b Coulter-Nile 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
36.1;W;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, OUT but he's gone now! England falling away. Full outside off, Buttler goes for the drive and just picks out mid-off inside the circle.

35.6;?;Watson to Ali, no run on off stump, pushed to the covers;

32.2;?;Starc to Buttler, no run full at off stump, played to mid-on;
32.1;W;Starc to Stokes, OUT he finds midwicket! Not Stokes' most convincing innings. A full delivery, angled into the pads, and he flicks it straight to Joe Burns...silence around the ground;Ben Stokes c Burns b Starc 13 (24m 23b 1x4 0x6) SR: 56.52;

29.3;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run down the leg side, Stokes tries to reverse sweep... Wade immediately throws the ball into the air and then signals for a review when it is not given on field; third umpire Kumar Dharmasena takes a look at several replays, including Hot Spot, and concludes that there was clear daylight between bat and ball. Well, Wade was convinced but no one else was... No Snicko on this occasion;

26.1;4;Watson to Taylor, FOUR runs bit of luck for Taylor this time, giving Watson the charge and thick-edging past his stumps down to long leg;

25.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Taylor, 1 run length, 86mph and tight outside off stump, played late and dabbed past short third man;
25.4;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run comes forward and gets the through the covers for a single;

24.1;1;Watson to Taylor, 1 run pitched full on middle and off, there's an "oooh" from the bowler as Taylor walks in front of his stumps and whips to leg;

22.4;4;Cummins to Morgan, FOUR runs Morgan gets an inside edge and it shaves the paint on off stump! Cummins has his hands on his head, Morgan gets four... The ball got up close and personal with the timber but there was not touching;

22.2;1;Cummins to Morgan, 1 run stays over the wicket, back of a length, waits on it and closes the face for one to midwicket;

19.5;1;Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run pushed back down the ground past the bowler;
19.4;1;Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run kamikaze from Morgan! Takes on the man in the covers, rather like Wade in the Australia innings, and even the rapid Taylor is struggling, he throws himself for the line as the throw comes in low... but Wade can't take it cleanly and dislodges the bails with his gloves.

17.6;?;Maxwell to Morgan, no run angled in with the arm and defended from the crease;
17.5;W;Maxwell to Roy, OUT steps away and drives, in the air... and taken at point! Maxwell has got Roy, slicing a shot straight to the fielder. Might have skidded on a bit as he was trying to force the ball over the off side - maybe an unnecessary risk, with singles coming regularly, but that's the game and Roy's a goner;Jason Roy c Warner b Maxwell 67 (71m 64b 11x4 0x6) SR: 104.68;

15.6;2;Marsh to Taylor, 2 runs short again and another whippy pull, this time of the front foot through midwicket;
15.5;4;Marsh to Taylor, FOUR runs quickly onto a short ball, that's a powerful pull which Burns can't cut off at deep square despite making good ground to it;

13.4;1;Marsh to Roy, 1 run on the pads again, poor line, tucked to deep square;
13.3;4;Marsh to Roy, FOUR runs back on the stumps but he's met with a wonderful piece of timing as Roy flicks strongly with his bottom hand and sends it rocketing through midwicket. That was pure timing. Played at the top of the bounce.;

9.4;?;Marsh to Roy, no run a shorter delivery which Roy goes to pull and misses, gets a blow on the top of the leg;

7.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Roy, 1 run on a length outside off, cut down to third man;
7.4;4;Coulter-Nile to Roy, FOUR runs dragged down short, you could hear a cry of 'no' from the bowler even before Roy had pulled it behind square for another boundary...fine leg had come inside the circle, too;
7.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Roy, no run full at off stump, Roy is forward and defends;

5.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Roy, no run beats him with a short-of-a-length delivery which he tries to run to third man...doesn't carry to Wade;
