Data
So England finish on 294, perhaps they would have expected more after the start they got. The openers had plenty of lives but maintained a punishing rate; only KP made a big contribution after the openers departed though and England couldn't reach the 300 they seemed set to get. It was a wonderful innings from KP, controlled initially before bringing out the big hits against the spinners. The slow bowlers are expected to get some help in the second half of the match, so Australia might have a tough task ahead of them.
I'm off to get some food. This is Siddarth Ravindran signing out. Liam Brickhill will be on hand in a bit to describe Australia's batting.
Hello everyone, Liam here. It was a fair effort from Australia to hold England to 294 after the start they had, but Ash isn't convinved with Michael Clarke's leadership: "Australia's best bowler today, Brett Lee, finishes 1 over short and Steven smith with 2 wickets and rate of 4 an over gets only 3. Hmm.. Clarke has some questions to answer there.."

12.4;?;Hussey to Strauss, no run;
12.3;?;Hussey to Strauss, no run Haddin lets out a huge appeal for lbw, unsupported by D Hussey. It was a skidder that held its line as Strauss played back and it seemed like it hit bat before pad. In fact it did not hit pad at all.;

6.4;?;Lee to Davies, no run dropped by Shane Watson, it was a very tough chance, a short of length ball outside off is hammered by Davies towards short cover, it's low and to the left of Watson, who has very little time to react, he sticks his hand out, it's in his palm for an instant but it doesn't stick;

4.3;3;Lee to Strauss, 3 runs and Strauss continues to live on the edge, a slower bouncer from Lee outside off, Strauss brings out the pull again, gets a top-edge this time, and there's plenty of excited calls of 'catch' from the Australian fielders but the ball loops over short fine;

Hello everyone, Liam here.
 Innings Start
Australia win by six wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the one-day series, and Shane Watson has been their hero tonight. What an innings it was from him, one of the best one-day innings in recent memory. It was almost a chanceless knock, perfectly-paced and calm under pressure. There was always the feeling that if Australia could get someone to bat through the innings they'd finish on top. England were aggressive with the bat, but didn't use the last two balls of their innings and how much of a difference could that have made? It's been a riveting summer of cricket between these two teams in the Test matches, and the limited-overs games look like they're going to be just as enthralling. And Australia have a reason to smile at last.
"It was a nice night tonight," says Watson. "It's always nice when things go your way. I was struggling for a while there and started cramping up. It would've been nice if I'd got a big score like this in the Ashes, but this is some consolation. It's nice to go 1-0 up but we're going to have to play some good cricket all through this series to win it."
"An outstanding effort from Shane Watson, one of the great one-day innings," concedes Strauss. "We didn't take early wickets, if we had done we would've been right ahead of the game. They needed someone to anchor the innings and Watson did so. We had a platform to get 310 at least there, but we lost too many wickets too softly. Watson showed how destructive he can be. Losing Anderson and Broad, our two bankers on one-day cricket, you put a lot of the onus on the guys coming in. It's hard to swallow this one, but we'll come back hard in Hobart."
And that is all from your commentary team today. We hope you've enjoyed our coverage, and if you've missed any of the action do have a look at Andrew McGlashan's bulletin. The second game is in Hobart on Friday, see you then!
49.1;6;Shahzad to Watson, SIX runs Watson roars Australia's victory! What a way to do it, a full toss is cracked baseball-style into the crowd behind long-on!;
48.6;1;Bresnan to Watson, 1 run very full, Watson meets it on the full and powers the ball down to long-on;

48.1;?;Bresnan to White, no run full, right in the blockhole. White slams down on it but mid-on charges round;
47.6;2;Shahzad to Watson, 2 runs slower ball, full outside off and Watson swings it into the leg side ... it won't be the boundary though, Pietersen sprints across to cut it off;

46.3;1;Tremlett to White, 1 run the plan may just be misfiring now, White knows it's going to be short every ball and is waiting for it, pulling out to deep square leg;
46.2;4;Tremlett to White, FOUR runs short again, hoicked wildly out to wide long-on, and that's four;
46.1;2;Tremlett to White, 2 runs short, rising on White and he hooks ... the top edge goes miles up, Trott charges in and falls forward, he gets both hands to it but the ball bobbles out!;

45.6;2nb;Bresnan to White, (no ball) 1 run no surprises, short again and pulled out into the deep ... and actually Bresnan's been no-balled for this bouncer! It won't be a Free Hit - his front foot was fine - but Bresnan's not happy. He says he wasn't told one for the over;
45.6;1w;Bresnan to White, 1 wide wide! Short again from Bresnan, the quick one this time but ballooning over the batsman and down the leg side;

44.1;?;Tremlett to White, no run short, White doesn't pick it up and is struck in the midriff as he shapes to pull. That smarts a bit...;

43.5;1;Yardy to White, 1 run flayed into the covers, Bell gets his hands to it to take the power out of the shot, good effort;

43.1;?;Yardy to White, no run driven on the up to Bell at cover;

42.6;1w;Bresnan to Watson, 1 wide Bresnan aims for the yorker, but sprays it down the leg side and the umpire signals wide. The bowler isn't happy, he thinks that clipped the pad. Watto is limping though, suggesting he's hit his own ankle with the bat;
42.5;1;Bresnan to White, 1 run this time he does get the single, down to third man;
42.4;?;Bresnan to White, no run back of a length to start, tapped down to gully;
42.3;W;Bresnan to Hussey, OUT slower ball, chipped in the air and Tremlett takes the catch at square leg! The match turns again, this could change everything.

41.3;2;Shahzad to Hussey, 2 runs landing on leg stump, Hussey flicks down to fine leg;
41.2;?;Shahzad to Hussey, no run cracked very hard into the covers, but that's a great stop by the fielder;
41.1;?;Shahzad to Hussey, no run huge, emotive appeal from Shahzad as Hussey is hit on the pad! But he's the only one to do so, and the umpire isn't interested. But they ask for the review. His foot is behind the line, so that's fine. No bat involved, it appears. But pitching just outside leg, so the decision stands. That was mighty close though!;
40.6;1;Bresnan to Hussey, 1 run pushed to wide mid-on, there's a chance for another two if they push hard ... but Watson's knackered and says no;
40.5;2;Bresnan to Hussey, 2 runs worked off the hip, Hussey is like lightning between the stumps and is back for the second in quick time! How's Watto doing at the other end? He's blowing a bit...;
40.4;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run chopped down on the off side, gully dives to save the run;
40.3;6;Bresnan to Hussey, SIX runs short, pulled, the ball hangs in the air ... and that's landed right on the boundary marker! It was top-edged but there was pace on the ball and he went for it, Hussey is turning it on;
40.2;4;Bresnan to Hussey, FOUR runs half-volley on off stump, and classically driven by Hussey! Didn't try to over-hit it, just stepped forward and presented the face of the bat, bisecting mid-on and mid-off to collect four;
40.1;2;Bresnan to Hussey, 2 runs slower ball from Bresnan, misdirected down the leg side. Hussey glances and, on fresh legs, is back for the second in a flash!;
39.6;1;Shahzad to Hussey, 1 run tapped into space at cover, and they take the single;
39.6;1w;Shahzad to Hussey, 1 wide yorker from Shahzad, but flung down the leg side. Hussey loses his footing and falls over;
39.5;W;Shahzad to Smith, OUT a wild slash from Smith, a good, diving catch from Yardy at short third man! The ball was full and he tried to go over the off side in typical fashion, but a thick edge flew to Yardy, who tumbled to his left and held on well.;Steven Smith c Yardy b Shahzad 5 (6m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125;
39.4;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run back of a length, pulled in the air but dropping short of cow corner;
39.3;1;Shahzad to Smith, 1 run short and fast, pulled away off the front foot to midwicket, just one;
39.2;4;Shahzad to Smith, FOUR runs slower-ball bouncer, a thick edge as Smith flails and the ball evades Davies! He threw everything at it, right off the toe of the bat and down to third man. Australia need more of the same - boundaries that is, not edges!;
39.1;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run crashed firmly down the ground, a superb exhibition of the on-drive ... but it's just one run with the fielder out there;
38.6;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run dabbed down to short third man, Smith is desperate for the single but Watson sends him back just in time;
38.5;W;Bresnan to Clarke, OUT chipped straight to cover! England strike, Clarke departs. Bresnan went full as Clarke stepped away to try and open up the off side, he drove well but in the air and Shahzad didn't have to move, just sticking his hands up to hold the catch.;Michael Clarke c Shahzad b Bresnan 36 (75m 57b 1x4 0x6) SR: 63.15;
38.4;1;Bresnan to Watson, 1 run short yet again, pulled away and Trott charges round to keep them to one;
38.3;2;Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs muscled out into the leg side;
38.2;1;Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run short again, pulled out to Pietersen and there's the 100 partnership;
38.1;1lb;Bresnan to Watson, 1 leg bye short to start, Watson attempts a paddle-pull but can't get it away, just the one;
37.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run that's gripped and turned! Popping up towards the hip, but negotiated by Clarke. And that ends Swann's contribution with the ball today;
37.5;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run powerful sweep from Watson, it's in the air for some distance but falls well short of Bresnan in the deep;
37.4;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run slashed down behind square on the off side;
37.3;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run more aggression from Watson, smiting a short one out to deep midwicket;
37.2;2;Swann to Watson, 2 runs top-edged just over Strauss at short fine leg! That popped off the glove and the England captain leapt up desperately but couldn't get a touch on it;
37.1;?;Swann to Watson, no run huge swipe from Watson, he misses completely and is lucky not to be bowled there! That skidded on, if it had turned he was a goner;
36.6;2;Tremlett to Clarke, 2 runs shaping away through the air, Clarke steps forward and drives out to the cover sweeper, they take on the fielder and that's good running, he's back safely for two;
36.5;?;Tremlett to Clarke, no run more length from Tremlett, defence from Clarke, and lots of noise from the crowd!;
36.4;2;Tremlett to Clarke, 2 runs short, pulled in the air well in front of square on the leg side ... the ball plugs on the outfield though, just two;
36.3;?;Tremlett to Clarke, no run back of a length again, defended to point;
36.2;4;Tremlett to Clarke, 4 runs pulled down to Pietersen in the deep ... and what's going on out there? A few moments of utter chaos from England in the field. The original return throw ricocheted off the stumps, and they took an extra two ... and then Bresnan's throw went through Strauss's legs at cover and they took another! Four runs! Tremors isn't happy;
36.1;?;Tremlett to Clarke, no run back of a length from Tremlett to start, Clarke hops back to defend;
35.6;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run a touch too short from Swann, Clarke backs away and cuts out to cover point;
35.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke comes down the track, and drives well down the track but straight back to the bowler;
35.4;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run swept hard by Watson, along the ground and scorching the turf down to long-leg ... but Shahzad is out there and fields cleanly;
35.3;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run yet another single from Clarke, down to long-on. What must his wagon-wheel look like...;
35.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run looped up much, much slower this time. Clarke comes down the track and defends back to the bowler;
35.1;?;Swann to Clarke, no run quick through the air, this newer ball has some bounce in it and it pops past the outside edge;
34.6;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run single down to long-on;
34.5;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run nudged to fine leg for one;
34.4;2;Yardy to Watson, 2 runs he goes for it again, this one is miscued and swirls up into the Melbourne night! But falls safely! Watto can see the funny side;
34.3;6;Yardy to Watson, SIX runs another! And this one's even bigger! This time he's on the front foot and slog-sweeping, getting right under it and lofting the ball deep into the crowd. Australia's fans are awake now!;
34.2;6;Yardy to Watson, SIX runs huge! That is a really long boundary, and Watson has cleared it by some distance! It was a touch short and he just rocked back and clubbed it over midwicket;
34.1;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run cracked past a diving extra cover, who gets a hand to it but can't stop the single. That sounded like a harder ball off the bat;
33.6;2;Swann to Watson, 2 runs a tired swipe across the line from Watson, he didn't get the greatest connection but still picks up a run;
33.5;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run nicely driven down the ground, again just one run;
33.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run this time he stays back, working to midwicket;
33.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke charges out of the crease but can't get to the pitch, defending;
33.2;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run driven down to long-on, just the single;
33.1;?;Swann to Watson, no run full, worked to midwicket;
32.6;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run drilled very hard down to long-on, Watson looks like he's itching to step up a gear here;
32.5;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run very full, Clarke almost yorks himself as he steps out but gets some bat on it to send the ball to short fine leg;
32.4;?;Yardy to Clarke, no run whipped to midwicket, straight to the fielder;
32.3;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run and he follows that up with a quiet single to long-on, good batting;
32.2;4;Yardy to Watson, FOUR runs power! Watson stands tall and absolutely hammers this, sending the ball arcing over Yardy's head and down to the straight boundary;
32.1;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run Clarke uses his feet and takes the single down to long-on;
31.6;1;Trott to Clarke, 1 run tip-and-run into the covers to end the over;
31.5;1;Trott to Watson, 1 run driven hard down to long-off;
31.4;2;Trott to Watson, 2 runs popped in the air! But just past Trott outstretched finger-tips, they sprint back for the second and there's the hundred for Watto! What a knock it's been, vital to his team's effort. Off comes the helmet, he's got a smile on his face and you can see how much that means;
31.3;1;Trott to Clarke, 1 run nudged just behind square on the leg side, a scrambled one;
31.2;1;Trott to Watson, 1 run punched in the air down to long-on, another single taken;

30.6;?;Yardy to Watson, no run driven straight to midwicket;
30.5;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run eased down to long-off for one;
30.4;?;Yardy to Clarke, no run quick and slightly short, Clarke hangs back and drives back to the bowler;
30.3;1lb;Yardy to Watson, 1 leg bye off the foot and rolling to Trott at short fine leg;
30.2;?;Yardy to Watson, no run Watson presents the full face of the bat and drives back to the bowler. He deserves a ton here;
30.1;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run nudged to square leg, a diving fielder cuts it off but can't stop the single;
29.6;2;Swann to Watson, 2 runs worked wide of the midwicket fielder, and the come back for an easy two;
29.5;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke jumps out and aims a wristy drive down to long-on;
29.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run quicker through the air, off the pad and straight to short fine leg;

29.1;?;Swann to Watson, no run whipped straight to man inside the circle at midwicket;
28.6;2;Yardy to Clarke, 2 runs Clarke is forward, then back as he picks up the length, and nudging down to fine leg ... the throw comes back in very sharply as they come back for the second and is Clarke struggling here? They ask the third umpire to have a look! ... He's safe, but only just;
28.5;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run punched to cover for one;
28.4;4;Yardy to Watson, FOUR runs heaved out to the straight midwicket boundary! Not the slog sweep, though he was down on one knee. Just swung across the line. Good connection;
28.3;2;Yardy to Watson, 2 runs very quick through the air, really darted, but too wide down leg this time and Watson glances down to fine leg;
28.2;?;Yardy to Watson, no run arrowed down flat on leg stump, Watson flicks but finds square leg;
28.1;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run touch too short to start, forced out to deep cover;

27.5;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run driven rather more firmly down to long-on;
27.4;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run quicker one from Swann, pushed to the left of midwicket ... who slides but can't quite cut it off, a single is taken;
27.3;?;Swann to Watson, no run slightly too short, but skidding on and Watson can only nudge to midwicket;
27.2;?;Swann to Watson, no run Watson is on the front foot, driving to cover;
27.1;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run pushed just behind square off the front foot;
26.6;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run bursting past the outside edge! That moved appreciably off the seam;
26.5;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run tapped down just to Morgan's left at point, they think about the single but the fielder is round in a flash and hurling in a shy at the stumps;
26.4;1;Tremlett to Clarke, 1 run short, Clarke's weight is forward but he pulls nicely down to fine leg, a controlled shot;
26.3;?;Tremlett to Clarke, no run slower ball from Tremlett, or it's slightly slower through the air at any rate - the offcutter perhaps? Flicked straight to midwicket by Clarke;
26.2;1;Tremlett to Watson, 1 run tapped down to gully;
26.1;2;Tremlett to Watson, 2 runs glanced off the pad and out to deep square leg, they push hard for the second and Watson is strugging ... but he's back in time! The throw is also just wide, which helps;
25.6;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run a flat-footed swipe from Watson, it's chipped in the air towards long-off ... but bounces just short of Tremlett! Watson is starting to look a bit weary here, and is targeting the boundary;
25.5;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke dances out and takes the ball on the full, pushing down to long-on for one;
25.4;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run pushed out to long-off for one;
25.3;?;Swann to Watson, no run Swann pulls the length back a touch and is quicker through the air, defended;
25.2;4;Swann to Watson, FOUR runs Australia needed a boundary to keep things under control, and Watson has provided it! Slog sweep from him, well in front of square, and out to straight midwicket. He cramps up after playing the shot, wincing in pain, which isn't a good sign;
25.1;?;Swann to Watson, no run floated up temptingly on off stump, solid defence from the batsman;
24.6;?;Tremlett to Clarke, no run Clarke lines up a front foot pull, but a thick inside edge cannons off the pad and - luckily for him - rolls wide of the stumps;

23.6;?;Swann to Watson, no run flicked to midwicket to end the over;
23.5;?;Swann to Watson, no run tossed up again by Swann, even slower this time, and again it goes back to the bowler;

23.3;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run pulled across from outside off, down to long-on for one;
23.2;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run turning in from outside off, cut out to deep point;
23.1;?;Swann to Watson, no run drift through the air for Swann, and as the ball rushes through he beats the outside edge! There's an appeal from the bowler, but that hasn't hit anything;
22.6;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run inswing again, but it comes out as a half-volley and Watson pushes to deep mid-off for one;
22.5;1;Shahzad to Clarke, 1 run this one hoops in through the air, Clarke taps just wide of point and they sprint through;
22.4;?;Shahzad to Clarke, no run definite swing for Shahzad, Clarke isn't quite sure which way it's going to go and is squared up as he pushes to mid-off;
22.3;?;Shahzad to Clarke, no run swinging out once again, the ball is full and wide and inviting the drive. Driven hard but straight to mid-off;
22.2;?;Shahzad to Clarke, no run just short of a good length, Clarke is back and defending;
22.1;?;Shahzad to Clarke, no run Clarke is turned inside out by an outswinging, dipping low full-toss, popping it back to the bowler who fields in his follow through;
21.6;4;Swann to Watson, FOUR runs ah, that ruins what had been a really good over! Speared down the leg side, Davies can't do anything about that and that's four;
21.5;?;Swann to Watson, no run a flicked drive goes straight to midwicket;
21.4;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run chopped down to gully, quick single taken;
21.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run he's down the track again, this time pushing back to the bowler;
21.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run down the pitch, and the ball is chipped just short of midwicket! Scratchy stuff from Clarke;
21.1;?;Swann to Clarke, no run arm ball from Swann, it was much too short but Clarke couldn't do anything with it, his cut shot beaten on the top edge;
20.6;?;Shahzad to Watson, no run sliced slightly by Watson, on the drive, but along the ground to extra cover;
20.5;?;Shahzad to Watson, no run slower ball this time, Watson steps well forward and defends square;
20.4;1;Shahzad to Clarke, 1 run this one goes the other way, a sharp reversing outswinger! The ball takes the outside half of the bat and bounces behind point;
20.3;?;Shahzad to Clarke, no run now, is this ball starting to reverse? It certainly appears so, this one snakes in through the air as Clarke drives back down the track.;
20.2;?;Shahzad to Clarke, no run tipped defensively towards point;
20.1;?;Shahzad to Clarke, no run a nervous, airy waft outside off from Clarke. The ball hit the seam and jagged away from him, beating the outside edge;
19.6;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke skips down, getting nicely to the pitch and driving down to long-off;
19.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run well forward to start, driving to cover;
19.4;W;Swann to Haddin, OUT slog sweep from Haddin, and he's picked out Shahzad at deep square leg! There's the breakthrough for England. The partnership is broken at 110, and Haddin departs for 39. It's not been the best knock from him, but he was doing a job and ticking along quite efficiently with Watson.;Brad Haddin c Shahzad b Swann 39 (80m 47b 5x4 0x6) SR: 82.97;
19.3;2;Swann to Haddin, 2 runs just a bit too short, nice shot from Haddin, delicately late-cut down to third man. Yardy chases the ball down;
19.2;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run Watson stays back again and punches wide of mid-off this time;
19.1;?;Swann to Watson, no run short from Swann, Watson was back and waiting for the aggressive pull but the ball just skidded through low to beat the bottom edge and land in Davies' gloves;
18.6;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run testing over from Shahzad, this time he fires in a yorker outside off and the ball nips right under the bat as Haddin jabs down at it. Through to the 'keeper;
18.5;4;Shahzad to Haddin, FOUR runs outside edge, genuine edge, and through the vacant slip region for four! Well wide of Davies, he had no chance;
18.4;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run a checked drive this time, again the ball goes to extra cover on the bounce;
18.3;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run fuller and straighter, defended to cover;
18.2;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run good shape away from the bat this time, that hasn't happened too often today. Possibly the legcutter once more, as the ball nips past the outside edge. As he has done all innings, Haddin had backed away to leg;
18.1;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run full on off stump, dug out towards mid-off;
17.6;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run pushed just to the left of mid-on, there's a call for the run straight away and the sprint through;

17.3;1;Yardy to Haddin, 1 run Haddin comes down the track and drives to long-off;
17.2;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run driven down to long-off, there's the 100. This is also, incidentally, Haddin and Watson's best opening stand for Australia;
17.1;?;Yardy to Watson, no run tossed up on middle, a bit of inside edge and a bit of pad gets 'keeper and bowler interested, but there's no appeal;
16.6;1;Bresnan to Watson, 1 run chopped down to gully, and they take the chance for a quick single;
16.5;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run quicker and shorter, beating Watson for pace and striking him on the hip;
16.4;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run inside edge, and the ball rolls just past the stumps! It was the slower ball from Bresnan;
16.3;2;Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs heaved across the line and out into the leg side, Trott runs across and hurls in the return, falling over as he does so, but can't prevent the two;
16.2;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run pushed down the leg side, the ball flicks the thigh pad and it takes a good, diving effort from Davies behind the stumps to cut that off;
16.1;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run a good length delivery, seaming in towards off stump, is defended back to the bowler;
15.6;?;Yardy to Haddin, no run and more defence to finish the over - a good one for Yardy and for England;

15.4;?;Yardy to Haddin, no run Yardy continues to tuck him up quite nicely, no width to work with;

14.5;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run Haddin plays from outside leg stump, but it's a defensive stroke back to the bowler;
14.4;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run nudged just wide of midwicket;
14.3;1;Shahzad to Haddin, 1 run to mid-off on the bounce this time! Haddin was lining up another big shot and but just went too early at this one, driving in the air but dropping short of mid-off, and they steal a single;
14.2;4;Shahzad to Haddin, FOUR runs up and over extra cover this time! Shahzad went full, Haddin backed away and scooped the drive over the infield. The ball slows up on the outfield but has just enough on it to get over the line;
14.1;4;Shahzad to Haddin, FOUR runs slapped to the long-on boundary! Haddin steps away and Shahzad follows him, but it's full and invites a shot. A firm thump flies wide of mid-on and races over the rope;
13.6;4;Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs bad line from Bresnan, and he's punished for it, glanced down to fine leg for four;
13.5;1;Bresnan to Haddin, 1 run sharp running! That was pretty close, nudged to gully and they just set off despite the fielder there. The throw was just wide, he might have been struggling otherwise;
13.4;?;Bresnan to Haddin, no run slower ball from Bresnan, giving Haddin no width to work with and he's quietly defended to mid-on;
13.3;?;Bresnan to Haddin, no run again Haddin gives himself room, forcing off the back foot but straight to the point fielder this time;
13.2;?;Bresnan to Haddin, no run fuller and straighter from Bresnan, Haddin taps slightly awkwardly to midwicket;
13.1;4;Bresnan to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin begins with a boundary! Stepping away to leg to a length delivery, he uses the resultant width to crack a cut shot out to the boundary;

11.4;2;Swann to Watson, 2 runs just a bit too short from Swann, Watson rocks back and pulls hard out to deep midwicket;
11.3;?;Swann to Watson, no run tossed up on a perfect length outside off, Watson steps forward and defends with bat and pad right together;
11.2;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run a hint of turn for Swann, but it's slow turn and easily negotiated by Haddin, tapped into the leg side;

10.6;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run and worked out into the leg side once more;
10.5;1;Yardy to Haddin, 1 run flicked out to deep square leg for one;
10.4;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run nudged just wide of midwicket, and that's fifty for Shane Watson. His team really need him to stick around and play through the innings;
10.3;1;Yardy to Haddin, 1 run looped up much slower, full on leg stump, and Haddin drives down to long-on;
10.2;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run Yardy, coming round the wicket, fires one in at leg stump and is clipped to midwicket. Shahzad sprints across and does really well to prevent the second run;
10.1;?;Yardy to Watson, no run pushed to mid-off;
9.6;1;Tremlett to Watson, 1 run whipped off the front pad and out into the leg side, and that's the first Powerplay done;

9.3;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run chopped down to gully;
9.2;2;Tremlett to Watson, 2 runs a top-edged pull, the ball swirls up, hanging in the air for an age ... and it's dropped by Trott, running back from mid-on! It was a really tough chance, he leapt back trying to take it over his shoulder but just got a hand to it and couldn't hold on;
9.1;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run cramping the batsman for room, the ball is tapped into the leg side;
8.6;6;Shahzad to Watson, SIX runs this time he does have a go, and slams it in some style into the crowd behind long-on! It was another slower ball from Shahzad, but too full. That was a 101-metre six, quite a monster;
8.5;?;Shahzad to Watson, no run slower again, much slower this time. For a moment it appeared as though Watson was going to have a heave at this, but he just held himself back and opted for defence instead;
8.4;2;Shahzad to Watson, 2 runs curving in through the air, but the ball starts too wide of off and Watson is able to punch out to deep point for a couple;
8.3;?;Shahzad to Watson, no run fuller and quicker, Watson aims a cautious drive straight to mid-on;
8.2;?;Shahzad to Watson, no run just outside off this time, again it's slower through the air, tapped to point. That was the legcutter, he just ran the fingers over the ball and got it to grip a touch;
8.1;?;Shahzad to Watson, no run good slower ball from Shahzad, but Watson spots it and defends;
7.6;3;Tremlett to Watson, 3 runs just short of a good length, Watson steps back and pulls out into the deep but Pietersen is there to cut the shot off;
7.5;2;Tremlett to Watson, 2 runs worked off the pad, behind square on the leg side and they're back for the second;
7.4;1lb;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 leg bye back of a length, the ball comes off Haddin's hip and they nip through for a leg bye;
7.3;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run for the third time Haddin steps to leg, this time drilling it hard to mid-off;
7.2;4;Tremlett to Haddin, FOUR runs lucky! Haddin backs away and aims an uncertain poke at a back-of-a-length delivery, a thick inside edge rolls wide of fine leg and that's four. Wasn't too far away from the stumps though;
7.1;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run Haddin looks decidedly nervy out there, again he steps away to leg and tries to slash up and over the off side field ... but is beaten on the outside edge by a touch of extra bounce;
6.6;?;Shahzad to Watson, no run Shahzad attacks middle and off on a good length, Watson defends watchfully to mid-on;
6.5;1;Shahzad to Haddin, 1 run short and wider of off stump this time, Haddin doesn't take full toll, just pushing it down to third man;
6.4;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run back of a length from Shahzad, he keeps Haddin deep in the crease as the ball is defended towards mid-on;
6.3;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run dropped down close on the off side, there's no run to be had as the fielder swoops;
6.2;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run Haddin gives himself some room but Shahzad's rhythm isn't disturbed and he aims a length ball at the off stump. Tapped to cover;
6.1;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run good start, hitting a length and moving in to the right-hander, who steps back and defends;
5.6;2;Tremlett to Watson, 2 runs short, pulled hard out towards wide midwicket but Pietersen charges across and tumbles over to save the boundary. Great fielding. Good field placement for Watson too;
5.5;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run slower ball from Tremlett, Watson was early stepping forward but re-adjusted quickly and cracked the full delivery to point;
5.4;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run Tremlett lets one go with a grunt and finds a good length on off stump. Played down to gully. He's looking for third man with the shot;
5.3;3;Tremlett to Haddin, 3 runs nice little shot from Haddin, as Tremlett slips too full and too straight and is worked out to deep midwicket;
5.2;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run and Haddin picks out gully exactly, chopping it straight to Strauss on the bounce;
5.1;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run Tremlett charges in and seems to put a bit more effort into this one, finding significant lift off the wicket as Haddin hangs back and defends to point;
4.6;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run Bresnan hones in on a good length, Watson defends;
4.5;1;Bresnan to Haddin, 1 run slower ball this time, but picked by Haddin who nudges into the leg side for one;
4.4;?;Bresnan to Haddin, no run well, the batsman steps away to leg and swings mightily at a length delivery outside off - hitting only fresh air. It was the cross-seamed delivery from Bresnan, and it gripped a touch on the wicket and moved away from the bat;
4.3;1;Bresnan to Watson, 1 run hmm, and he follows that up with a much more awkward-looking chop down to that third man fielder. Still, gets the job done and that's a single;
4.2;4;Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs Watson is in top form here, hitting the ball just where he wants to. The slip fielder had just been moved - Strauss it was - and so Watson aims a delicate late cut right through that region, beating Pietersen at third man for a boundary;
4.1;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run tight, length delivery right on middle and off. Watson defends;
3.6;1;Tremlett to Watson, 1 run nicely done, not a great deal of width to work with as the ball lands on a length on off stump, but Watson just stays on leg stump and glides it down to third man for one;
3.5;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run Watson drops a back-of-a-length delivery close in on the off side and briefly considers a cheeky single, but the fielder is in too quickly;
3.4;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run Haddin faces up to just his second ball, nudging a full delivery just wide of mid-on for a quick single;
3.3;1;Tremlett to Watson, 1 run properly short this time from the bowler, Watson rocks back and pulls out into the deep - but there's a man out there, Pietersen, to stop the boundary;
3.2;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run Tremlett pulls the length back, Watson defends to cover with a hop;
3.1;4;Tremlett to Watson, FOUR runs a handsome straight drive! Tremlett goes full and Watson is parked on the front foot waiting for the ball, the left elbow leads the shot and mid-on has no chance;
2.6;1;Bresnan to Watson, 1 run a thick inside edge thumps into the pad and rolls to leg, and Watson will keep the strike as they scamper through for one;
2.5;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run Watson's just tried to make too much of this, it was short and wide and there to be hit but he tried to smash it too hard and ends up hitting it hard into the ground and straight to point;
2.4;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run Bresnan adjusts his line, attacking the stumps, and Watson defends;
2.3;2;Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs clipped down to third man, they push hard and that's well run for two;
2.2;4;Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs cracking drive! Watson is great to watch when he's in this sort of form, he strides confidently down the pitch and slams a technically perfect drive through the covers. Power and placement.;
2.1;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run flung down on a length, but outside off and easily left alone. Not a great deal of movement on offer for the quicks so far;
1.6;1;Tremlett to Watson, 1 run slightly wider of off, Watson steps forward and runs it off the face of the blade down to third man;
1.5;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run great length from Tremlett, drawing the batsman forward but extracting enough bounce to hit the splice as Watson defends to extra cover;
1.4;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run Watto is looking to impose himself early here, lunging forward to drive hard into the covers. He finds the fielder, however;
1.3;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run that's better from Tremlett, he straightens his line and Watson stays deep in the crease to defend back down the track;
1.2;4;Tremlett to Watson, FOUR runs slap! Wide again, and short this time. Watson cashes in with a flashing cut that beats a diving point and also evades third man;
1.1;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run full and shaping away to start - this was quite wide and went even further. A thick outside edge bounces down to third man;
0.6;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run shaping gently away through the air, Watson steps well forward and drives into the covers;
0.5;2;Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs delicate late cut from Watson, but Yardy's fielding down at third man is just as good and saves two runs;
0.4;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run cracked square on the drive this time, Morgan fields nicely on the bounce;
0.3;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run full again, but outside off this time and Watson aims a crunchy drive right at mid-off;
0.2;4;Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs Watson is away! Too straight from Bresnan, slipping towards leg stump and Watson just had to get a touch on it - fine leg is very square;
0.1;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run nice and straight to start, good length too. Coming in gently off the seam, and Watson steps forward to defend to mid-on;

Right, we're all set for the second half of this game. Shane Watson is marking his guard as England's fielders scatter across the MCG. Brad Haddin is up at the other end, and it'll be Tim Bresnan to open the bowling for England.
