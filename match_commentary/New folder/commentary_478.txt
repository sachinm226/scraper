What a superb display from Brendon McCullum. He has well and truly silenced the critics and shown just how devastating he can be on his day - not that anybody doubted that. He has done it on the international stage and becomes just the second player to score a T20I hundred, finishing 116 not out, one run short of Chris Gayle's record of 117.

Hello and welcome to Christchurch for the 2nd T20I between New Zealand and Australia.
Daniel Vettori has won the toss and will bat first again. In team news, Tim Southee comes in for Daryl Tuffey, which is a slight surprise.
While for Australia, Travis Burt is in for Shane Watson and Ryan Harris is in for Mitchell Johnson, who was MOM in the first match in Wellington.
The weather is fine with some high cloud. We are headed for a maximum of 28 degrees C and the surface is in pristine condition.
The pitch has played well in the curtain raiser between the two women's teams even though there were only 210 runs scored. New Zealand won the match to take the T20I series 5-0 after losing the ODI series 5-0 - remarkable turnaround.
The crowd are streaming in for this evening's match and hopefully we will see the stands at near-capacity.
It will be interesting to see how New Zealand's top order handles the pace and hustle of Tait, Nannes and Harris after the Australian's produced a stunning opening six overs in Wellington which New Zealand were never able to come back from.
Hopefully, for everyone's sake, New Zealand can produce a strong performance with the bat to test Australia later on in the evening.
I am Marc Ellison and Gopi Rangarajan is scoring for us. We look forward to bringing you coverage of tonight's game. So sit back, get comfortable and enjoy the action.
Tait to bowl to Brendon McCullum to get things underway.

 Innings Start
Australia scored six off their Super Over, New Zealand won by scoring nine off four balls.
Brendon McCullum is Christchurch's hero, scoring 116 off 56 balls, but don't forget Tim Southee, who somehow prevented a rampaging Cameron White from winning the match in normal time. He then returned to bowl a stunning Super Over full of yorker-length deliveries.
The New Zealand players are out on the field thanking the crowd, their fans have been vocal today. Ross Taylor's signing autographs. We've had a superb finish, and the T20 series is level at 1-1.
Vettori says it's one of the most "amazing crowds" he's played in front off. The noise as Southee ran in to bowl the final ball of the 20th over was something else. McCullum says it was "nice to make a contribution". Talk about understating it!
That's it from us at Cricinfo for the moment, on behalf of Marc Ellison, this is George Binoy signing off. Cheers.

Right, buckle up for the Super Over. The team chasing will bat first, so White won't have to take his pads off. Australia's three batsmen are White, Warner and Haddin. If they lose two wickets, that's the end of the Super Over innings.
White and Warner are out there, Southee, who bowled a magnificent last two overs, has to do it again for New Zealand.
