Innings Break 2.12pm Sri Lanka manage 8 for 239. Lahiru Thirimanne played nicely at the top of the order and Dhananjaya de Silva did a good job late but it was the Australian spinners who dominated. They took five wickets between them. Zampa was the only one to take two but Smith and Maxwell also chipped in.
Thirimanne: "Initially it was seaming a bit. But it also went up and down. I thought we batted well in the first 10 overs but after that we couldn't capitalise. The spinners spun the ball and I thought it didn't come onto the bat. I thought we're 40-50 runs short to be honest."
kushansri: "Finaly.. sri lanka batted out 50 overs without getting all out... "
Usman Khawaja is expected to open the innings despite copping a blow on the knee in the field. We'll see how Australia fares in the chase. Sreshth will return to take you through the start of the chase.

Thanks Sreshth. Mitchell Starc has the new ball. Thirimanne on strike.
10.30am Alright, then. We're ready for the first ball. The Sri Lanka openers are walking out, and it's time for Alex Malcolm to take control.
Jack: "I'm around!! I don't reckon much will tune in for a warm-up, but against Afghanistan in around a week..... bring it on!!"
Pranay: "Australian fans don't send any comments and then complain that only comments from sub-continent get published. I am an Indian but seem to have more interest in this match than my Aussie counterparts. Why? Because sub-continent is cricket crazy :D"
Captain interviews:
Karunaratne: "May turn later, so there may be turn later on. We'll bat. We've got a lot of experienced guys, and some youngsters. Malinga and Isuru are not playing."
Finch: "ODIs are different that T20s. But there's pressure here to score big, and need to make match-winning hundreds unlike T20s. Warner and Smith are crucial to our team - world class."
10.21am Not too much chatter from Australia fans this morning. Are you guys here? Hopefully Glenn McGrath not choosing Australia as favourites should wake you guys up!
Sri Lanka field 13 players today, in some manner or the other. They can all bowl/field, if need be, but only 11 can bat.

ESPNcricinfo is proud to present Cricket Picks, a fast and fun predictor game that tests whether cricket fans can accurately pick the results of each match over the entire Cricket World Cup, along with predicting the best performers of the entire tournament."
It works over three stages, beginning with pre-tournament (now, till May 30) and up to the final. All it takes is 60 seconds per week to predict who will win the next week's worth of games, week by week, over the round robin stage and the finals. Players can create their own private competitions for family, friends or work colleagues, join official competitions for fans of each nation, or just play solo against everyone else in their Cricinfo edition or globally

Karunasoma: "Can we have the SL squad ?" -- As soon as the official team sheets are in.
10.13am For a bigger picture of the game, and deeper insights from the match and beyond, don't forget to follow our LIVE REPORT with Dan Brettig through the day. He's started already!
10.05am Toss: Sri Lanka bat first. A few changes for the Australians today: No Warner, Coulter-Nile or Behrendorff today while Maxwell, Cummins and Starc return to the team. Australia will play 12.
Australia: Aaron Finch, Usman Khawaja, Shaun Marsh, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, Nathan Lyon, Adam Zampa, Nathan Coulter-Nile, David Warner, Jason Behrendorff
Sri Lanka: Kusal Perera, Dimuth Karunaratne, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Jeevan Mendis, Milinda Siriwardana, Thisara Perera, Jeffrey Vandersay, Suranga Lakmal, Isuru Udana, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Pradeep, Avishka Fernando.
10am Who will win the World Cup? And who will be the Player of the Tournament? ESPNcricinfo's correspondents predict.
Varahan: "Teams that have been robbed of good match practice due to the washouts have to feel lucky. On the bright side, they'll have their team intact without injuries! Contending teams that are lucky enough to go through the tournament with injuries to their core members have a good chance to win the WC."
9.52am Steven Smith was on the receiving end of a few boos against England, but no one in the Australia camp seem to mind. Alex Carey, in fact, says it 'adds to the competiion'
Dilhan : "Most valuable question here is "Who will win the WC?" Most say England and India... Mmmmm... But i think "Rain" will win it and Already have 2 in their bag." -- Let's hope we 'warm up' to more sunny days (sorry for the dad joke!)
Roshan Indika: "How will be the weather forcast today ?" -- Our correspondent Melinda Farrell is at the ground, and she says "beautiful sunny day!"
9.30am Hello. After a washed-out Sunday, we're back with more World Cup warm-ups.
We're in Southampton today, for the final hit-out for both Australia and Sri Lanka. Dimuth Karunaratne's men desperately need to fix their all-round woes before the tournament begins. Australia will be boosted by a winning performance against England few days ago, and it won't be surprising if some of their confirmed starters sit out. Victory for Sri Lanka, though, could do wonders for their confidence even if it would mean nothing on the record books. So sit back and relax, as I, Sreshth Shah, and Alex Malcolm welcome you to ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage.
Dan Brettig is on our Live Report all day too, and we'll share the link for that page shortly.
 Innings Start
6pm That's all from us at ESPNcricinfo. Hope you enjoyed our coverage. See you soon for more cricket tomorrow
Finch: "We want game 1 to get underway (Laughs). Feels like we are ready to go. Practice games are great to keep ticking the boxes and ensure we are doing our basics well. Great position compared to 12 months ago when we were trying to fill spots. Guys are putting their hands up, and it will be a brutal selection call come our first game. We have specific plans against Afghanistan, they have some world class players."
Karunaratne: "We got some positives. A 50-run start, but after that we lost key wickets. We needed some good partnerships. The cold is not easy too (laughs). Udana and Fernando are fine. Malinga, we gave some rest, because we want him for whole nine matches, so need to take care of him. We need to see how we can improve in the coming matches. We are excited for the first game of the World Cup. But we will try to have fun in these five days. We'll give our best for 1st June."
Khawaja: "Felt good. Nice to get some time in the middle. To win another game means a lot more. Knee is sore, apparently the boys said that the sound hitting the knee was very loud (laughs). There is no competition between Shaun Marsh and me, I love batting with him. Just enjoying each others' company."
5.45pm So two wins in a row for Australia before their World Cup campaign begins. Two losses for Sri Lanka. One good sign for Sri Lanka was Thirimanne's performance. Their pacers were solid too, their spinners slightly disapponting. As for spinners, Australia's were excellent. They had four men bowl spin - Smith, Lyon, Zampa and Maxwell - and they all took wickets. Khawaja was excellent with the bat too, and despite his injury, looked in stellar form. Stick around for reactions from both captains.
Red Dirt: "Actually, it is three wins in a row - West Indies, England and Sri Lanka."
Nalin: "Sri Lanka survived the 50 overs. Posted a below par but decent total. Got half of the opposition out. Took the game to the last 10 overs. It has been a good day for us Sri Lankan fans "

This time he misses, and it hits him near the boot. Umpire says no, so Sri Lanka review. Surprised that was given not-out on the field, now we see whether there was any inside edge. No inside edge off the bat, but Khawaja got a bit of glove, and therefore survives. That was close! Some say that it could've been out, because the bat's toe was hitting the ground too, and therefore earned a spike on UltraEdge, but the TV umpire believes that was ball on glove which caused it.
