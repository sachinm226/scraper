Let's just forget about all that and get on with the game. Ponting and Warner are out. Zaheer to begin.
Shastri: "When I captained India in the one Test, there was an argument with Raj Singh Dungarpur. He asked to pick a player. I told him while I'm in the field I'm in charge. If I pick your player, I will give him just two overs. He said, alright, pick whoever you want."
Shastri was arguing in favour of the captain being completely in charge of picking the XI.
Vishal: "It is ridiculous. India has made a mockery of themselves through their selection and performance on this tour. I feel ashamed when they put people before logics."
Toss: Australia are batting first. Clarke: "23 degrees here, better than 41 at Perth. Hussey's rested and Peter Forrest gets an opportunity." Daniel Christian plays, so no place for Mitchell Marsh.
Dhoni: "Tendulkar has been rested. Gambhir comes back, Praveen Kumar sits out and Umesh Yadav comes in."
Shastri still fumes: "Get that 100th hundred and focus on beating Australia. If you lose to Sri Lanka in the first leg, there won't be a second leg."
Let's take a break from Sachin. Here's Gordon: "How does Irfan Pathan not get a gig? Yadav is a good upcoming bowler as we saw in the tests, but he is not economical and you need to be that in limited overs. You could argue Pathan would be just as expensive, but at least he brings some talent with that bat unlike 90% of the Indian tail."
I kind of agree, because Irfan, like Rohit, is in good touch, but not getting the opportunities in the middle.
Raj: "Tendulkar against Australia, 50% of psycological battle will be won by india before the first ball is bowled, his record against aussies speaks for itself."
Hamsharfi: "Tendulkar rested. I guess it will give a good break for the little master.What now, more than 330+ days since he scored a century, how many more chances does anyone get..brave Dhoni."
1 pm: Good morning/afternoon everybody and welcome to the coverage of the fourth match of this series. The circus moves to the Adelaide Oval.
The suspense deepens over whether Sachin Tendulkar will play or not. If so, he will of course be "rested." As Sidharth Monga mentioned in his preview yesterday, Rohit Sharma has a right to the XI and should not be accommodated at the expense of one of the top three.
Shastri, when told of the possibility that Tendulkar may not play: "It's a joke, an absolute joke. Then what is he doing here? Tell me. You bring him to Australia, to play your best XI. The why didn't they "rest" one of the seniors in the final Test and take Rohit Sharma? " Shastri is fuming.
Aakash Chopra wrote in his column yesterday about the theory of resting seniors, why it's a bit flawed in India's case.
The toss should happen very soon.
 Innings Start
So McKay crumbles under pressure in the final over. With 13 needed, Australia would have fancied their chances but Dhoni quietly saved his best for the last over. It was a strange old knock but in end India got home in a heart-stopper.
India beat Australia for the first time at Adelaide and it's their first win against a Clarke-led side on this tour. It's quite ironic looking back at the abuse Dhoni received when he was struggling, to the response now. Abuse to praise in 60 seconds... Here's an example:
Dav: "Sucks all the life out the innings, makes me lose all faith in his ability, then nonchelantly rescues victory from the jaws of defeat. I swear Dhoni does it on purpose."
Here's another interesting stat from Rajneesh Gupta: "Highest batting avg in successful chases (Min.25 inns): Dhoni (104.89), M Clarke (89.20),Bevan (86.25) & M Hussey (83.87)."
Here's the presentation:
Clarke: "Dhoni is a very good one-day player. We were 10-20 short and the fielding was sloppy. Great to see Forrest get an opportunity."
Gambhir is the Man of the Match: "Any runs in Australia is special. Dhoni is a good finisher and he stays calm and that's important. I want Yuvraj to get well soon and we hope he comes back soon."
Dhoni: " This six was very special. The World Cup six was too but we could have done that with singles. You have to analyse whether you should be playing that shot. There were a few shots we shouldn't have played in this game so we need to work on that. We need to now concentrate one game at a time. Yuvraj will get well soon and I believe he will come out strong."
112 meters - that was the length of that last-over six. In Adelaide Oval it's no joke.
It was good fun bringing this game to you today. Thanks for the mails and the Forrest puns! Look forward to your company on Tuesday for India v Sri Lanka. Cheers!
