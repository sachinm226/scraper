...and Australia have declared on 497 for 8. That means around 45 minutes for Joe Denly and Rory Burns to bat out this evening, which might prove a tough ask with the light gradually beginning to fade, not least after a long old day in the field. SPD Smith's magnificent 211 underpinned the innings and dominated the day, but there were useful runs for Labuschagne (yesterday), Paine, and Starc to help him along. England were pretty average with the ball - Broad and Leach stuck at their task well, Archer was short of his best, and Overton was fairly lukewarm. I'll be back in five to talk you through the rest of the day.

42.3;?;Stokes to Head, no run yorker, sweeps Head off his feet, massive appeal but not given! England review... looked reasonably convincing in real time.

 Innings Start
That's a massive 196-run lead for Australia with, I make it, 63 overs left in the day. Bat for 50, get the lead to 400, and have a dart at England before the close? Or will Tim Paine be more cautious than that? That innings from England felt like a series of missed opportunities, albeit against some very good bowling from Hazlewood, Cummins and today better stuff from Starc. A number of batsmen made starts (or better) but couldn't convert to the three-figure score needed. I'll be back in a few moments for the start of Australia's second innings to see if England can nab some early wickets.

92.6;W;Cummins to Archer, OUT edged, and gone! This is a pretty poor shot, really. Length ball, just outside the off stump, which gets up well of the surface and nips away a touch, and his airy waft only succeeds in edging it behind. England in trouble!;Jofra Archer c ?Paine b Cummins 1 (23m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 5.26;

92.4;?;Cummins to Archer, no run outswinger, just back of a length outside off, Archer has a nothing-y waft at it and misses it again. Paine appeals, but isn't sufficiently convinced to send it upstairs. Don't think he was anywhere near it... as UltraEdge now confirms;
92.3;?;Cummins to Archer, no run fuller on fourth or fifth stump, driven out into the off side but the man at cover fields well;
92.2;?;Cummins to Archer, no run length ball angled in towards off stump, defended out into the covers;
92.1;?;Cummins to Archer, no run fires a very wayward bouncer down the leg side, which Archer ducks underneath;

88.6;?;Starc to Buttler, no run hangs one slightly too wide of the off stump, Buttler leaves it alone;
88.5;4;Starc to Buttler, FOUR runs strays slightly too full, bit of a half-volley just outside the off stump and Buttler drives sumptuously through cover for four;
88.4;1;Starc to Archer, 1 run back of a length, slightly too straight, Archer fends this away square of the wicket behind short leg, he jogs down to the far end, there's a shy at the stumps and it would have been out with a direct hit!;
88.3;W;Starc to Stokes, OUT got 'im! Starc gets Stokes with a ripper, a bit of nibble away off the seam from over the wicket on a length, Stokes nibbles at it and his outside edge is well held by Smith at second slip!

87.1;?;Hazlewood to Stokes, no run tight line and length just outside off stump, Stokes leaves it alone on length;
86.6;?;Starc to Buttler, no run back of a length at off stump, dropped to the off side and he sets off for a single...Stokes sends him back. These two had a run out at Headingley! All safe this time;

84.6;?;Starc to Buttler, no run short, wide outside off, left alone...a sighter for Buttler;
84.5;W;Starc to Bairstow, OUT through him! That could change things for Starc. Trademark dismissal. Good length delivery, swings back at Bairstow who goes for the drive and leaves a big gap. Loose shot against the new ball, but excellent bowling;Jonny Bairstow b Starc 17 (59m 37b 2x4 0x6) SR: 45.94;

83.1;?;Hazlewood to Stokes, no run over the wicket, full at the stumps, defended;
82.6;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run an attempted yorker, perhaps, as it was very full at the stumps, clipped to mid-on;
82.5;1;Starc to Stokes, 1 run dropped, but a very tough, low chance in Starc's followthrough as Stokes bunts a full delivery straight back down the pitch. Starc couldn't quite get down to his right. Fingertips. Would have been a blinder;
82.4;4;Starc to Stokes, FOUR runs inside edge flies over the stumps, no luck for Starc, Stokes gets away with it...movement off the seam;
