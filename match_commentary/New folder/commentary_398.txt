Data
2.55pm: So, Australia manage to hoist themselves above 250 thanks to a handy cameo from Lee, who might've have been caught on 3 but swung his bat with gusto. That looks some 20-30 runs short, on a decent wicket - though I think the average score batting first at The Oval is something like 255, so it might not be as bad (for George Bailey) as it looks. We'll see how England's nu one-dayers fair chasing in about half an hour's time. Could they really make it eight ODI wins in a row? Bit of light rainfall in south London but hopefully we won't lose any more time.
49.6;3;Dernbach to Lee, 3 runs slower ball, out of the back of the hand, Lee shovels the ball skyward again, it's coming down between long-on and long-off ... Morgan gets there but can't cling on as his body hits the turf, the ball popping free and allowing Lee to pick up three;
49.5;1lb;Dernbach to Johnson, 1 leg bye length delivery, Johnson has a golf swing at it, hit on the pad and it slides away towards the slip - Dernbach appeals but it probably pitched outside the line;
49.4;2;Dernbach to Johnson, 2 runs another slow delivery from Dernbach, worked into a gap in front of midwicket;
49.3;1;Dernbach to Lee, 1 run length ball on off, frees the arms again but gets an inside edge to backward square leg;
49.2;2;Dernbach to Lee, 2 runs slower ball, on the stumps, Lee swings hard, comes off the toe of the bat and loops short of Morgan this time, coming in from long-off, the ball skips past him and they come back for two;
49.1;1;Dernbach to Johnson, 1 run pitched up and shovelled back down the ground;
48.6;1;Bresnan to Johnson, 1 run full and straight again and chopped back past the bowler for one;

48.4;1;Bresnan to Johnson, 1 run full and wide of the stumps, dug out towards long-off, they think about two but think again;
48.3;1;Bresnan to Lee, 1 run pitched up on off, driven to mid-off;
48.2;6;Bresnan to Lee, SIX runs low full toss and this time Lee middles it, fetching the ball a long way over the rope at long-on. BOOM!;
48.1;1;Bresnan to Johnson, 1 run full and again swiped down the ground - Lee has to jump out of the way again;
41.6;2;Swann to Bailey, 2 runs full and juicy, Bailey goes big ... it's not got the legs to clear the rope but returns to earth between Bresnan at deep midwicket and Morgan at long-on. Bresnan perhaps hesitated and couldn't quite get his hands to the catch, despite throwing himself full length;
41.5;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run flighted on off, driven down the ground to long-on;
41.4;2;Swann to Hussey, 2 runs steered through the off side this time and another couple to deep backward point;

40.3;1;Bresnan to Hussey, 1 run banged in short and pulled agriculturally through midwicket;
40.2;?;Bresnan to Hussey, no run short and wide and slapped hard through point ... well, would have been if Morgan hadn't cut it off superbly;

47.6;1;Dernbach to Johnson, 1 run pitched up and chopped back down the ground, the ball clipping Lee at the non-striker's end on its way;

47.4;2;Dernbach to Lee, 2 runs slower ball, slogged down the ground and Morgan drops it at long-on - perhaps had half an eye on the rope, he was that close, but should've been taken;

46.3;1;Bresnan to Lee, 1 run short ball to Lee first up, dabbed to third man;
46.2;W;Bresnan to Bailey, OUT another full bunger and bowled 'im! Excellent death delivery from Bresnan, pitched up and asking the batsman to take a chance - Bailey did but his heave-ho was unsuccessful, the timbers sounding a death rattle;George Bailey b Bresnan 65 (108m 86b 7x4 0x6) SR: 75.58;

38.1;?;Finn to Bailey, no run length ball outside off, pushed towards point;

20.3;W;Bopara to Clarke, OUT but this is edged behind! Goodness me I did not expect that, a little cutter outside off and Clarke feathers it low to Kieswetter.

16.3;?;Broad to Watson, no run forward to solidly block now to a similar line;
16.2;?;Broad to Watson, no run forward, struck on the pad and given out! It looked good, did he get outside the line, it's referred, it was hit on the knee roll, going over? Yep it is, a good referral by Watson, the ball going over leg stump according to Hawk Eye, only just though, a millimetre from the bail;
16.2;1w;Broad to Watson, 1 wide leg side wide;

14.2;W;Broad to Forrest, OUT great catch! And Broad strikes, it was dug in and Forrest looked to pull, it came off the face of the bat and a diving Kieswetter snaffled it with one hand, superb take. Seemed to be beaten for pace there Forrest, he looked to help it on its way but ended up brushing it behind where he was very well taken;Peter Forrest c ?Kieswetter b Broad 12 (42m 30b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40;

7.1;?;Dernbach to Forrest, no run bumper and swayed outside the line;
6.6;?;Finn to Watson, no run forward blocking on a length on off stump;
6.6;1w;Finn to Watson, 1 wide short and drifts down leg side for a wide, was that actually out of the batsman's reach? Seemed to be very close to leg stump but rules are rules;

6.4;?;Finn to Forrest, no run blocked in a similar region;
6.3;?;Finn to Forrest, no run back of a length now and blocked;

5.3;?;Dernbach to Watson, no run forward to block on off stump;
5.2;?;Dernbach to Watson, no run full and driven at, edged and dropped in the gully and it's Trott to put the catch down. It was angled in and the drive produced a very thick edge but a diving Trott couldn't hold it going to his right, it was a good height and a bad miss;

4.1;W;Finn to Warner, OUT and there is the wicket! Pulled straight up and into the hands of square leg. It was short and slightly wide, Warner tried to fetch it to leg and was late on the stroke, getting a top edge that looped up to square leg.

Here we go then, Steven Finn to open the bowling to Shane Watson...

"I'm very sorry to hear that Pat Cummins is out of the tour, injured yet again. The prospect of having discovered a new Dennis Lillee was thrilling, but unfortunately it seems Australia might have discovered a new Ryan Harris." Indeed disappointing John, hopefully he's a young man who will get stronger and more resistant to injury. James Anderson remember was very injury prone in his early days and is now the best in the world...

Alastair Cook says England would have bowled first, interesting. No worries for their team with a straight swap, Dernbach for Anderson with Jade coming in on his home ground and he will be desperate to impress.

Positive signs for England would you say with these team changes for Australia? Obviously the injury to Cummins can't be helped but the change of Smith for Forrest is obviously designed to bolster their batting, fearful of England's powerful bowling line-up?

10.30am Let's confirm the teams then... England Bell, Cook, Trott, Bopara, Morgan, Kieswetter, Bresnan, Broad, Swann, Dernbach, Finn
Australia Watson, Warner, Forrest, Clarke, Hussey, Bailey, Wade, Johnson, Lee, McKay, Doherty

10.15am Australia won the toss and will bat Peter Forrest replaces Steve Smith and Johnson confirmed as Cummins' replacement. For England, Jade Dernbach on his home ground comes in for James Anderson.
10.00am Good morning and welcome to coverage of the second NatWest one-day international between England and Australia from The Oval. England took the honours at Lord's with another impressive all-round display, but there isn't much to choose between the two teams.
The early news from the ground is that Pat Cummins is out of the tour. That's a big blow for Australia and adds to the concerns about the strain on his body at a young age. No replacement has been called into the squad. The word is that Mitchell Johnson could play today. There is also doubt of James Anderson, who has a groin strain, with Jade Dernbach favourite to replace him. We'll confirm the teams shortly.
 Innings Start
7.10pm: Victory at The Oval - England's first over Australia at this ground since 1997 - means Alastair Cook's side take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. Australia's total looked a little soft and doughy, their batsmen having not quite done enough (despite George Bailey kicking on, his crawl to 26 off 60 balls epitomised their struggles) and England executed a textbook run chase on a good surface. A whiff of controversy will cling to Morgan's successful review - Hot Spot wasn't conclusive, so the decision shouldn't have been overturned, even though he seemed confident he'd hit the ball - but Bell and Bopara were excellent and England should have got there even without their lucky No. 5. Ravi Bopara was named Man of the Match and his run-a-ball knock was just the sort of composed-but-lively innings Australia couldn't muster. There's life in the series yet, however, and the tourists will need to regroup before Edgbaston on Wednesday. We'll be back to bring you full coverage - until then, keep working on rotating the strike. Cheerio
45.4;2;Doherty to Morgan, 2 runs tossed up, bit of room and Morgan cuts, gets a bottom edge, it beats Wade, running away behind the stumps - that'll do it, they run the two needed, and England have won by six wickets with a good, solid handful of overs to spare;
45.3;?;Doherty to Morgan, no run round the wicket, turned on the front foot to midwicket;
45.2;W;Doherty to Bopara, OUT tossed up, tip and run to mid-off - and Brett Lee's direct hit sends Bopara back! That's a shame, he should have been there at the end, but a matchwinning [not yet, not yet] top knock from the Essex man;Ravi Bopara run out (Lee) 82 (129m 85b 8x4 0x6) SR: 96.47;

43.3;?;Lee to Bopara, no run defended back to the bowler and Lee nearly hits Bopara with a wild throw at the stumps, Wade does well to prevent overthrows;

33.4;?;Clarke to Morgan, no run back of a length and moved to midwicket;
33.3;?;Clarke to Morgan, no run big cry for lbw and given out! Morgan goes for the review straight away, did Morgan get outside the line? Probably not but is that a mark on Hot Spot? It might be the faintest inside edge, it was an immediate review, so he was convinced he'd nicked it. And it's overturned so there's enough evidence that Morgan did hit the ball;
33.2;?;Clarke to Morgan, no run blocked just outside off;
33.1;W;Clarke to Bell, OUT and he does strike! Bell goes to cut a ball that slid onto him and loses his off stump. It was too full for the stroke and a poor stroke first ball to a new bowler anyway, and Bell missed it and it ran onto off stump;Ian Bell b Clarke 75 (154m 113b 6x4 1x6) SR: 66.37;

29.5;?;Johnson to Bopara, no run played out to point from the crease;
29.4;?;Johnson to Bopara, no run loud cry for lbw as it beats Bopara on the inside edge i'm sure that pitched outside leg, not out but Australia review it, could be too high also. Indeed pitched outside leg stump so we go no further and Australia lose their review, a little bit out of desperation that;
29.3;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run clipped into midwicket from back of a length;
29.2;?;Johnson to Bell, no run another great shot but this time super fielding at extra cover, Bailey getting down low to save;

27.3;?;Doherty to Bell, no run driven back to the bowler;
27.2;4;Doherty to Bell, FOUR runs down the pitch, tried to take on mid on, gets it past him but only via a squirted outside edge, didn't really get to the pitch of the ball but still got four;

26.6;?;McKay to Bell, no run tight line and beats Bell as he looked to open the face again;
