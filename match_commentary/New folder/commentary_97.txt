Data
5.10pm: So, England bowled out early, which was pretty much what was expected when they were 8 for 5 (EIGHT for FIVE) in the seventh over. But not quite as early as you might have imagined, with their big-bottomed lower order helping them to within a sniff of 200. Chris Woakes continued his fine series with the bat by pulling and driving his way to 78 - at a good lick, too - as England gave themselves something to bowl at. You would think, however, that the sizzling new-ball efforts of Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins have determined the outcome here. Can Australia pull one back in the series? Miller will be here to see how they go in half an hour
44.5;W;Tye to Tom Curran, OUT gone! Tye finishes it with the knuckle-ball, ending Curran's sally with a mistimed chip to midwicket. A cheeky thirty at a run a ball helping England to respectability, but almost certainly not enough;Tom Curran c Marsh b Tye 35 (35b 2x4 1x6) SR: 100;
44.4;4;Tye to Tom Curran, FOUR runs full, room for Curran to free the arms and he crashes a drive to the cover boundary - four more!;

42.4;W;Tye to Woakes, OUT slower ball, slugged down the ground... and well taken by the fielder running in from long-on!

32.2;2;Tye to Tom Curran, 2 runs edged again but this time it doesn't carry! That's because it's the slower ball - the knuckleball - and dies in front of the keeper;

7.4;1;Cummins to Morgan, 1 run oh, not far from a drag-on! Pitched up and Morgan wanted to drive, ends up thick-edging past his legs for a single;
7.3;1;Cummins to Ali, 1 run touch short, rising over off stump and Moeen dabs it down short towards cover, they hustle through for one more;
7.2;?;Cummins to Ali, no run back of a length, lets this one go;
7.1;1;Cummins to Morgan, 1 run pushed across the bows, Morgan reaches for a prod through cover point for one;
6.6;1;Hazlewood to Morgan, 1 run short ball, Morgan pulls and splices it... but safely into a gap on the leg side and it bobbles through midwicket for another single - and England are into double-figures, hurrah!;
6.5;1;Hazlewood to Ali, 1 run length, on middle and leg, Moeen prods a little tentatively and it rolls of the inside edge through midwicket;
6.4;?;Hazlewood to Ali, no run angled across in the channel, lets this one go;
6.3;?;Hazlewood to Ali, no run searing short ball, climbing through as Moeen hangs back;
6.2;W;Hazlewood to Buttler, OUT zips off a length, grazes the outside edge! ENGLAND ARE 8 FOR 5!!! (Or 5 for 8, if you're that sort...) Brilliant ball from Hazlewood, not too much fault with the batsman here: perfect length, seaming a fraction as Buttler felt for it in defence, flicks the bat and Paine swallows another!;Jos Buttler c ?Paine b Hazlewood 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
6.1;?;Hazlewood to Buttler, no run length ball around off, Buttler defends;

5.4;2;Cummins to Morgan, 2 runs pitched up and Morgan strokes a couple back past the bowler, neatly driven fine of mid-off;
5.3;W;Cummins to Root, OUT dug in, Root wafts at a pull, gets a big, ballooning top edge... and Hazlewood pockets the catch at fine leg! Root bags a duck and England are four down! Good pace and bounce, the bumper got too big for Root and he sent it right down the fielder's gullet. This could get ugly;Joe Root c Hazlewood b Cummins 0 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

4.3;?;Hazlewood to Morgan, no run pitched up on off stump, solid forward press in defence;
4.2;W;Hazlewood to Bairstow, OUT pitched up, finds the outside edge - another one goes! England are tottering like aunty on the gin... Hazlewood went wide on the crease and slid the ball in, enticing the drive but there was just enough seam movement to shift the line and kiss the edge of the bat. Bairstow slopes off in the fifth over for a nine-ball duck;Jonny Bairstow c ?Paine b Hazlewood 0 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
4.1;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run on the stumps, Bairstow watches it under his nose and defends;

3.3;?;Cummins to Root, no run fired in straight, Root gets well across and blocks;
3.2;W;Cummins to Hales, OUT bowled 'im! Superb ball from Cummins and England are two down for spit! There's been some nip off this fresh surface and Cummins locates the perfect length, it jags back appreciably as Hales presses forwards, flicks the front pad before rattling the off pole;Alex Hales b Cummins 3 (11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 27.27;
3.1;?;Cummins to Hales, no run Cummins trundles in, hits a good length and Hales defends;

0.6;1w;Hazlewood to Hales, 1 wide short and wide, Hales throws the bat and misses... not far off feathering through, from the looks of it, but the umpire decides Hazlewood should bowl that one again;
0.5;?;Hazlewood to Hales, no run tapped into the off side coming across;
0.4;?;Hazlewood to Hales, no run length, 138kph on a fourth-fifth stump line, Hales shows it the maker's name in defence;
0.3;?;Hazlewood to Hales, no run pitched up in the channel, shaping away a touch as Hales shuffles into line and lets it go;
0.2;W;Hazlewood to Roy, OUT got him, slashed to point - Roy goes second ball! Full and quite wide but there was swing for Hazlewood and Roy was reaching for a loose drive without having got his bearings, Smith snaffles the low catch and Australia have nipped out an early one again;Jason Roy c Smith b Hazlewood 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
0.1;?;Hazlewood to Roy, no run length, 138kph and speared in to hit the pads as Roy moves into line, there's a half-hearted lbw appeal but it looks a touch high and leg side;

Right, possums. Pull on that corked hat and pull the pin on a green grenade... It's Australia Day at Adelaide Oval and we are readyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to ruuuuuuuuuuuummmmmble! Josh Hazlewood will take the first of the new balls, Jason Roy on strike. Two slips in
1.45pm: The IPL auction is this weekend. Will Ben Stokes be the biggest buy? Meanwhile, it's anthems time... Tum-ti-tum-ti-tum
"Why didn't Aust pick Lloyd Pope," chuckles Jimmy. "Has a great record against Eng I understand..." Ah, the Wizard. He had a day out in Queenstown, for sure. A giant (relatively speaking) legspinner with a flowing ginger mane - what's not to like? He could be tormenting England for years to come
1.30pm: The weather looks to have cleared up in Adelaide, although it's cooler and damper than expected. Australia will be hoping there's a little juice in the deck and, perhaps, that England's attention levels have dipped after taking the series in Sydney. Meanwhile, on the subject of nu-England's rampaging approach to batting, here is S Rajesh's Number Game, hot off the presses. Eat that up it's good for you.
"What's the point of calling a player as cover if he's not gonna play?" chunters Ziyad. "Might as well do without him for a game?"
And on the same subject, here's Rob Noah: "sticking with Cameron White, eh... over Glenn Maxwell. Well that's my patriotism gone, GO THE POMS!!! SMASH 'EM SILLY!!!" Maxy's not quite back, no. I guess the logic being that they called up White for Chris Lynn initially, and it would be tough to ditch him on the back of a single innings at No. 3 (although, to be honest, I can't really see him there for the World Cup in 18 months' time)
1.20pm: We've have a toss! And Australia have won it and will bowl, they are going to try and chase again. Travis Head returns to the top of the order, in Finch's absence, while Mitchell Starc is rested and Andrew Tye gets another crack. Just one change for England, with Tom Curran replacing the injured Liam Plunkett.
Australia 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Cameron White, 4 Steven Smith (capt), 5 Mitchell Marsh, 6 Marcus Stoinis, 7 Tim Paine (wk), 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Andrew Tye, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood
England 1 Jason Roy, 2 Jonny Bairstow, 3 Alex Hales, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan (capt), 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Tom Curran, 11 Mark Wood
1.15pm: Seems like it might be raining in Adelaide... which is certainly not part of the script. So there may be a delay to the toss. In the meantime, why not have a read of Darren Lehmann saying "Aww, look... she'll be right"?
"Wow, commentary from the future!" Thanks, Dave, I'm glad you've noticed our foresight and hip attitud... I've got the timezone wrong again, haven't I?
Here's Ryan, who's been rummaging in the 'guru: "SPD Smith's 50th match as Aus ODI Captain today. Puts him outright 6th on Australia's list for most matches as Captain, edging 1 game past both GS Chappell and KJ Hughes. Only another 179 to catch RT Ponting." Who'd bet against Smiffy? Although he could do with relocating his Test form, after a tricky fortnight...
1pm: G'day, cobbers. Welcome to the tippy-tappiest live coverage of the fourth ODI, with England on the march down under. The tourists have clinched the series and now have their sights set on a 5-0 sweep; Australia, of course, won't be keen to cooperate (having never been whitewashed at home in a five-match ODI series), but their cause hasn't been aided by the loss of Aaron Finch to injury. It's Australia Day, but will it finally be Australia's day? Our preview sets the scene and then we'll bring you the toss and team news in 20 mins.
 Innings Start
8.53pm So, that is the end of that. So, the series moves to Perth for the finale ... and the start of a new era with the WACA put to mothballs and 60,000 people anticipated in the city's new purpose-built stadium. Join us there on Sunday for all the fun of the fair.
Mark: "Aus might like to reflect that they have been rescued by Travis Head. Had he got out for 70 instead of staying almost to the end, they would have lost." Quite possibly. But they didn't. Happy 'Straya Day, y'all!
eddie: "Don't understand Morgan's take on their batting here... Bairstow, Hales and Roy all nicked off chasing wide balls just doing a little bit very early in their innings. That doesn't mean there's too much in the pitch, its just juvenile batting." Indeed. I suspect that one will have some legs in the post-match analysis...
Steve Smith "Nice to get over the line, a pretty ordinary [batting] display... It all happened pretty quickly for a moment there, 5 for 8 you'd take any day."
8.59pm Time for some presentations: "We fought really well to get Australia seven-down, but to be five-down after ten overs and no boundaries in the first 15 really shows how much there was in the wicket," says Eoin Morgan, which is an eyebrow-raising take on England's collapse.
"Having broken into the middle order a few times, if we could have reopened a few cracks..."
Pat Cummins is Man of the Match "I think the wicket here has been brilliant for the last couple of years. Josh is about the best bowler in the world in ODIs, lands it on a dime every time with a bit of movement."
8.52pm James: "Given where they were after 6.2 overs (creek and paddle come to mind) England have done pretty well to make a competitive game of this." It goes to show that their competitive spirit is second to none in this format at present. But their headlong stampede to a batting collapse didn't do them much credit. It was rather the same against South Africa at Lord's this summer...
Charles : "Paine relief!" I see what you've done there
36.6;3;Wood to Tye, 3 runs drilled down the ground and Australia win by three wickets! They made hard work of a game that they basically had in the bag after 6.2 overs, but they've avoided the whitewash;
36.5;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run spanked out to square leg, can't beat the field, but a comfortable single;
36.4;4;Wood to Paine, FOUR runs swivel-pulled through backward square, and suddenly that pressure, on Australia and Paine himself, has evaporated!;
36.3;4;Wood to Paine, FOUR runs short and wide, that will help no end!;
36.2;?;Wood to Paine, no run a sharp bouncer, and swayed inside the line;
36.1;W;Wood to Cummins, 1 run, OUT full length, clipped down to long-on and there's a huge mix-up! How on earth did that happen? Cummins turned blind for the second, his partner was going nowhere, and rightly so, as the shy came in, Wood gathered and flicked off the bails, and ... well ... jitters! EDIT: There would have been two if Paine had pushed the first one ... he'll know he was at fault;Pat Cummins run out (Curran/Wood) 3 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
35.6;1;Woakes to Cummins, 1 run outside off, and tapped through to third man;
35.5;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run slightly wide outside off, Cummins pokes with flat feet;

35.3;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run punched hard off the back foot, and well grabbed with one hand at backward point;
35.2;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run opens the face to guide a single into the covers;
35.1;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run banged in short, a pull off the eyebrows, to backward square;
34.6;?;Wood to Cummins, no run short outside off, 138kph/86mph and Cummins drops the hands;
34.5;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run round the wicket, dug in short and Paine swivels to send it safely down to fine leg;
34.4;1;Wood to Cummins, 1 run touch short in the channel and Cummins gets this away down to third man for one;
34.3;?;Wood to Cummins, no run length outside off, 138kph and stabbed towards point;
34.2;W;Wood to Head, OUT oh no! Head has pulled to mid-on! Four runs short of a deserved century, he's failed to get on top of the bounce and sent a straightforward catch straight to Morgan. Head heads off with his head bowed in disappointment, but he can hold his, er, head high after guiding the chase;Travis Head c Morgan b Wood 96 (107b 15x4 0x6) SR: 89.71;
34.1;?;Wood to Head, no run back of a length and tapped back down the track;
33.6;1;Woakes to Head, 1 run slanted across, slower delivery from Woakes, Head sits in the crease and glides one more to third man;
33.5;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run banged in, tepid bumper and Paine swivels on a pull for one;

Time for drinks, with Head closing in on an accomplished hundred and Australia nearing a consolation win
"Hope Head doesn't get dropped for the last game," chirps Prajwal. "White, imo, has to hit the road." Depends on Finch's fitness, I guess. But White hasn't really been able to grab his chance
