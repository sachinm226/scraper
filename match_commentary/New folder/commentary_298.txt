6.47pm Both captains and Dean Jones had said before the match started that it was a beautiful batting pitch. These 50 overs have showed otherwise and Pakistan also bowled and fielded very well to stifle the batsmen. Warner gave a strong start and it was mainly Smith's 77 that took them beyond 200. Back in half-an-hour for the chase.
Bishen strikes again: In the last 20 years there have been only three instances of Australia scoring fewer runs after batting all 50 overs against Pakistan
Wasif: "Attitude of team Pakistan is changed totally.Positive fielding and surprisingly they gave just 5 extra including 1 wide and 1 no ball "

 Innings Start
11.25pm And that's it from all of us. Hope you enjoyed following our ball-by-ball coverage. Until next time, it's good night from Vishal, me, and all the scorers. Before we go, here's one last comment:
Hammad: "The tempo of Misbah clapping was too slow when sitting at the bench and that's why Pakistan lost the game"
11.15pm Presentation time.
Here's George Bailey, the winning captain. "It's always tough to win series overseas so very satisfying to win 3-0. We didn't quite play our best in all three games, but it's a positive when you find ways to win despite that. It was a lot slower than what we expected and a little bit of dew later in the night. Another wonderful innings from Steve Smith and Davey Warner, but I thought we were 20-30 short."
Steven Smith is the man of the series, but Danny Morrison doesn't seem to want to talk to him.
Glenn Maxwell is the man of the match "Wasn't going too well until the last over. Got a bit of luck at the end and it was a good win at the end. He [Bailey] was just saying don't get hit for runs. Still looking for the big scores to solidify my spot for the World Cup."
What does Shahid Afridi have to say? "First of all I want to appreciate my bowling unit, they bowled really well. In the batting, from the first T20 till the last ODI, the thing we are missing is partnerships. We are not finishing properly. This game we had to win and we missed the opportunity. The World Cup is not very far, and we have to learn quickly, it's the most important thing for us."
Brendan: "This game might see the revival of the old 'Panic-stan' nickname. "
Abhishek: "u needed a WOW.. u got a 0W000W"
Staying with the same theme, here's Vinay: "'O wooow' describes the last over and my general feelings rather well. And I thought South Africa were the chokers..."
Turrab: "Glenn Maxwell is some player!! Double wicket maiden in last over of the match is no ordinary feat... from a diehard Pakistan fan."
Abhishek: "What a game..Maxwell given 2 runs to defend. He delivers a maiden with 2 wickets..Made me remember SRT's last over against SA in 1993"
11.00pm Whew. What a game. Pakistan went into that final over with only two runs left to get. Here's what Maxwell did - 0W000W. A double-wicket maiden. Pakistan simply fluffed it, slogging away at Maxwell when some fairly sensible batting from the lower order had taken them to the cusp of victory. As it happens, Australia have wrapped up a 3-0 series win and retain their number one ranking in ODIs.
49.6;W;Maxwell to Irfan, OUT Maxwell has won it for Australia! That was on the stumps and Irfan swung hard at it. The ball took his outside edge and looped in the air and the man at cover took a simple catch;Mohammad Irfan c Faulkner b Maxwell 0 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

Maxwell ran from backward point and threw to the bowler. Both batsmen had set off, and the run simply wasn't on. When Faulkner collected, Babar was a long way from the stumps. He swished at the stumps with the ball and missed first time, and then had to go through the process again. He hit, and replays show Babar was still an inch short of his crease. But they didn't go up to the third umpire!;
46.2;?;Faulkner to Babar, no run short ball first up, and Babar ducks hurriedly under it;
46.1;W;Faulkner to Anwar Ali, OUT slants this across outside off, not quite up there to drive, and he goes after it and slices it at a catchable height to Maxwell at backward point;Anwar Ali c Maxwell b Faulkner 14 (39m 28b 0x4 1x6) SR: 50;
