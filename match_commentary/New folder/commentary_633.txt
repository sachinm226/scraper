Tossed-up, full in length, on the off stump line, Ponting skips down the track and whips it, but it goes in the air and Ross Taylor, at midwicket, jumps up to grab it.

10.4;1;Tait to Fulton, 1 run That's mighty close. It hit the pad first. Full in length, lands just outside off stump, slants in, Fulton goes for a drive, bat comes outside the line, the ball thuds into the pad in front of off stump. Hmm.. that was hitting the middle.

8.6;1nb;Tait to Styris, (no ball) No ball called. Asad Rauf gets it wrong. He had some part of the feet planted behind the line. Hmm... short of length, outside off stump, left alone. The back foot also just cleared the return crease.;

Banged in short, on the middle and off, Fleming tries to pull off the front foot, the ball bounces more than he anticipated, and thudded into his left arm before bobbing away to Ponting at second slip. They go up in appeal and Aleem Dar raises the fatal finger. No wonder Fleming was not happy, it beat the bat and went off the arm.;Stephen Fleming c Ponting b Tait 12 (18m 9b 1x4 1x6) SR: 133.33;
