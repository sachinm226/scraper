Welcome back, here come the Australian openers, West Indies taking some time to get back into the middle, they were having a discussion in a huddle, now they come.
It will be Roach bowling to Watson with two slips and a gully in place.
 Innings Start
So Australia take the series 2-0, after some sweating. They won Gabba easily, hung on to draw Adelaide, and clinched Perth by 35 runs after dominating most of the Test. Terrific effort from West Indies to get this close when few expected them to. It's been a thrilling chase.
Healy's asking Bollinger if he though Roach hit that. "Smashed it," says Bollinger, who admits they were a bit concerned with the review taking so long.
I've been flooded by emails saying that Roach should not have been given out because replays didn't show an edge. I don't think that's how it works. Bowden gave him out on the field and since replays did not prove that he didn't nick it, the on-field decision should stay. The irony is that, if Bowden had given him not out, and the Australians had asked for a review, Roach might well have been given not out after the review because replays didn't prove that he was out. It's complicated, this UDRS. I couldn't tell whether he nicked it or not. Hot Spot didn't show much, but it often doesn't pick up faint edges. This debate will rage on and on ...
They are showing Snicko now and there's a faint indication of an edge. Ever so faint, it could have been an edge, it could have been something else. I guess only Roach will really know.
Chris Gayle is the Player of the Match for an astonishing century in the first innings. How West Indies would have dearly loved a few more from him in the second. "Congrats to Ricky and his team, you guys played better cricket," says Gayle. He goes on to praise his team-mates "I'm really happy for the guys and the way they played but very disappointed as well ... I want to commend Adrian Barath on his first hundred .. Kemar Roach did really well as well." He rates his two hundreds in this series among his top five innings.
Gayle is also the Player of the Series.
"We've played in two very even Test matches," says Ponting. "I think the fans around Australia have seen some very good cricket in the last couple of weeks." Ponting says his injury is improving, he hopes to be fit for Boxing Day.
Here's Peter English's bulletin of this morning's play.
Thank you for all your emails. Do join us for our coverage of the Pakistan series, which begins on Boxing Day in Melbourne. I'm off to continue the UDRS debate with my colleagues. This is George Binoy signing off. Cheers.
On behalf of Lawrie Colliver, George Binoy and Gopi Rangarajan, this is Binoy George waving ta-ta and bye-bye, thanks for tuning in for the Test series.
94.3;W;Bollinger to Roach, OUT high drama! Australia have appealed for a caught behind and Roach has been given, he wants a review, it's so marginal, can't really tell if he nicked it or not, replays aren't conclusive and in such cases I think the on-field decision should stay, Roach fended at the ball off the back foot as it angled across him ... the Australians were extremely confident ... Hot Spot shows nothing much ... the wait is long and tense ... and he's been given ... fair call too since there was no evidence either way;Kemar Roach c ?Haddin b Bollinger 17 (41m 29b 3x4 0x6) SR: 58.62;
