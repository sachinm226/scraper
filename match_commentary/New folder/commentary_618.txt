Hodge must be wondering what it takes to score a one-day ton! He was undefeated on 99 against the same side in the CB Series recently and now he falls three short of another well deserved ton. He wouldn't mind that too much though.
He scored 10 fours and two sixes in his knock and his stand with White was worth a massive 84 off just 7.3 overs at a rate of 11.20 an over. A rude shock for the home side no doubt. The story so far has been of two of Australia's domestic warhorses who've had to wait years for the big break. Both scored at over a run a ball and exploited the short boundries to the hilt - the innings included 13 sixes. Brad Haddin began the charge with a few clean hits; he failed to connect a few but the intent was there. The pitch is still quite a belter and New Zealand can back themselves if they preserve a few early wickets.

 Innings Start
What an amazing win for the home side and with that they have taken the series 2-0 and have also managed to topple Australia from their No.1 spot in the ICC rankings. Have your say
This is quite a stunning turn of events just before the World Cup. The world champions, riding on a crest not too long ago have drifted off course and the teams they tormented - England and New Zealand - have clawed back and evened the score. It was the self belief of New Zealand which saw them through, courtesy Ross Taylor, Peter Fulton and Craig McMillan. Not for the first time in the recent past, Australia have been struck by a blizzard, just when they might have thought that a score of 330+ was safe enough.
Here's what Fleming has to say at the presentation - "McMillan does what he does best. Those big partnerships there were the setup. Ross Taylor has already arrived on the scene. He's going to be a great player for New Zealand and those types dont come along too often. These conditions were the best I've seen at Eden Park. The fact that we chased these runs just shows how difficult it is to defend such scores. To win the Chappell-Hadlee series is just terrific.
Over to Ross Taylor, the man-of-the match for his 117 - "It hasn't really sunk in to be honest! I had a lot of luck early on, got a few inside edges here and there. Fulton batted well in the middle. For me No.3 and 4 are fairly comfortable positions."
All that's left now is a dead rubber at Seddon Park in Hamilton with New Zealand aiming for a clean-sweep and Australia looking to salvage their battered pride. It will be foolish to jump to conclusions on their fortunes in the World Cup. Once their big guns return, make no mistake, they will come back hard and strive to snatch back the No.1 ranking from South Africa.
Jamie Alter will take you through the final ODI on February 20. I, Kanishkaa Balachandran, enjoyed bringing this thriller to you, despite the graveyard shift! Let me leave you with this message from Hemant Pathak, "World Cup is now wide open."
