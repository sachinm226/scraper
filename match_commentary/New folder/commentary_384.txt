5.20 pm Australia have finished with a strong total on a slowish pitch, with Clarke and Warner scoring contrasting centuries. Warner was the slower one, Clarke was quick and quite terrific. Sri Lanka were poor in the field, several fumbles, some overthrows and five dropped catches. They aren't out of this yet though, because Australia could have easily got about 300, the way Clarke was going. But it's a tough one, but Sri Lanka are playing an extra batsman today ... I'll be back in 40 minutes for the second innings.
Kaustubh: "Warner's innings will cost the Aussies today's game. Just like Dilshan's 160 against India which came of 165 deliveries." Brave call, that.

48.6;W;Kulasekara to Clarke, OUT and after that bit of sloppiness, Herath produces a direct hit to run out Clarke. Clarke played the ball straight to the fielder at midwicket and set off, he's in discomfort as he runs though and doesn't dive to try and make his crease. Herath's throw has him well short. Clarke's played a terrific innings but is in pain as he walks off, looks like an issue with his leg;Michael Clarke run out (Herath) 117 (143m 91b 5x4 4x6) SR: 128.57;
48.5;1;Kulasekara to Hussey, 1 run dropped again, how many today? Hussey backward away and swung a length ball straight to Herath at midwicket, that was an absolute sitter, shocking fielding from Herath;

46.1;3;Herath to Clarke, 3 runs what a shot that is, Clarke began to try and paddle the ball to fine leg, and then opened the face to reverse paddle the full toss through third man. He assumed it was going for four though and didn't run initially, Malinga gave chase and pulled it in, sloppy cricket from Clarke after a superb hundred;
39.6;1;Maharoof to Clarke, 1 run full ball on the pads, flicked through midwicket for a single;
39.5;4;Maharoof to Clarke, FOUR runs Clarke's been trying to do this for a while now, moving forward and towards the off just a little, to create room to whip the ball off his hips to the long leg boundary;

39.3;?;Maharoof to Warner, no run Sangakkara throws the ball up in the air in celebration and Maharoof appeals confidently, but the umpire is unmoved. Warner tried to squeeze a full ball through the off side and was beaten. I think the bat hit the ground there, and missed the ball completely;

34.4;3;Kulasekara to Clarke, 3 runs Clarke gets to his half-century by tapping a length ball off his pads towards fine leg, a horrible line from Kulasekara in this over. Clarke's adjusted beautifully to the slowness of this surface, he assessed it in no time at all.;

33.4;1;Malinga to Warner, 1 run shoddy work from Malinga, Warner played the ball back to the bowler and Malinga failed to stop it cleanly, he reacted as though he got a touch on the ball before it very close to the stumps at the non-striker's end, with Clarke out of his crease. He should have fielded it cleanly in the first place;

33.2;?;Malinga to Clarke, no run good length around off stump, Clarke stays in his crease and blocks;

32.3;1;Maharoof to Warner, 1 run a slower ball, which Warner drives to mid-off and challenges the fielder. He beats the throw at the bowler's end, the fielder missed anyway. Warner hobbled a little after completing that run, probably a little sore after that groin injury;

29.2;2;Kulasekara to Warner, 2 runs length ball angling across Warner, he slogs across the line and mis-hits the ball behind square, he was aiming more towards midwicket;

25.6;?;Dilshan to Warner, no run defended towards cover;
25.5;2;Dilshan to Warner, 2 runs that's full and on the pads, Warner turns if behind square and there's more silliness from Sri Lanka in the field. Sangakkara was chasing the ball, and Kulasekara was running in from the deep and there was a small collision between the two. Wonder how Jayawardene's blood pressure is today.;

21.2;?;Dilshan to Warner, no run bowled slowly to Warner, who plays from the crease on the leg side;
21.1;1;Dilshan to Clarke, 1 run Dilshan returns and gets an outside edge from Clarke, as the batsman was trying to play on the leg side, the ball went towards third man;
20.6;?;Herath to Warner, no run driven firmly back to the bowler, Herath slips a little as he fields, and is a little slow in getting to his feet;

19.5;1;Malinga to Clarke, 1 run short of a length outside off, Clarke taps it into the gap in front of point and runs, Dilshan picks up and throws at the bowler's end. He misses but I think Clarke was safe even if there was a direct hit;

19.3;?;Malinga to Clarke, no run Clarke cuts hard off the front foot but Dilshan dives to his left to save runs;

19.1;?;Malinga to Clarke, no run good length and straight, defended back to the bowler;
18.6;1;Kulasekara to Clarke, 1 run Clarke strides forward and drives to mid-off, fluent shot, Clarke's moving nicely in his crease, coming forward to cope with the slowness of the pitch;
18.6;1w;Kulasekara to Clarke, 1 wide that's too full and down leg side;
18.5;?;Kulasekara to Clarke, no run a loud appeal for lbw after Clarke misses the pull. The ball was slower and Clarke moved across his stumps to play the shot. The impact was a bit high, on the box;

18.3;?;Kulasekara to Warner, no run defended on the leg side;

17.5;6;Maharoof to Warner, SIX runs Warner's smashed it! He wound up and swung hard at a length ball on the front foot, clearing the wide long-on boundary comfortably. That's a long boundary at Adelaide Oval and Warner hit the ball into the stands. That was measured at 99 metres. A monster of a hit.;
17.4;?;Maharoof to Warner, no run played off the back foot towards cover;
17.3;1;Maharoof to Clarke, 1 run Clarke drives a full delivery firmly off the front foot but Mahela dives to his right at mid-off to stop the ball, saved three runs;

15.1;W;Maharoof to Warner, OUT Watson's been run out! He dived full length into the crease but has still been caught short by Maharoof's direct hit. Dilshan and Herath will be very relieved men, after they both dropped Watson. Warner pushed the ball on the leg side and ran a quick single, Maharoof sprinted to his left, picked up, turned around, and threw at the batsman's end. He could have attempted to run out Warner as well, but decided Watson had had enough let-offs. A badly judged run. Watson was watching the ball and I don't think he expected Maharoof to throw at his end because the bowler had to turn around and transfer the ball from left to right hand;Shane Watson run out (Maharoof) 15 (42m 34b 0x4 0x6) SR: 44.11;
14.6;?;Dilshan to Watson, no run Watson forces the ball towards midwicket;

13.6;?;Maharoof to Watson, no run Watson pulls but gets an inside edge on to the body;
13.5;2;Maharoof to Watson, 2 runs dropped again, by Herath at long-off. The fielder had been pushed back to long-off, and Watson played the lofted drive. Herath once again mis-judged the catch by running in too far, he then had to back pedal to get under it. In the previous game he managed to take a blinder off Wade after an initial misjudgment, this time he stretches out one hand and drops it as the ball falls behind his head. Watson's been let off twice.;
13.4;?;Maharoof to Watson, no run short of a length outside off stump, Watson throws his bat at it, aiming to hit the ball through point. The ball came slowly off the surface and beat the bat;
13.3;?;Maharoof to Watson, no run defended on the off side, that was a slower ball;

Game time in Adelaide. Warner and Wade opening for Australia, they set up that huge total in Brisbane with a strong opening partnership. Sri Lanka are opening with Tillakaratne Dilshan's spin, from round the wicket.
Toss, 1.30 pm Michael Clarke's won the toss, Australia will bat again. "David Warner is 100% fine and will open the batting today," says Clarke. Ben Hilfenhaus isn't playing though, Clint McKay is. That's the only change to Australia's XI.
Mahela Jayawardene says he would have bowled first on a "fresh wicket" and aimed to chase down the total, so he isn't too disappointed. Sri Lanka have strengthened the batting, replacing fast bowler Dammika Prasad with middle-order batsman Chamara Kapugedara. So they have lengthened the batting order, with the aim to chase. Angelo Mathews isn't fit to play yet.
Ian Chappell on Star Cricket is raising an issue of David Warner batting the whole innings in Brisbane, not fielding for a ball in Sri Lanka's chase, and playing here again. Well it's not against the laws or anything, since Warner did injure his groin, but it does raise what I believe is an issue with the laws.
The problem is this: Warner batted for 50 overs and then Australia can use a substitute for him while they field, but a Sri Lankan fielder who fielded for 50 overs but gets cramp after batting for maybe 30 overs won't be able to have a runner. It's hypothetical of course but could well happen.
John: "David Warner hasn't missed a match so far this summer in all forms of cricket, and he is still going. A testament to his fighting spirit. Only man to play this many matches this summer."
Sri Lanka have only three specialist bowlers - Malinga, Herath and Kulasekara. Maharoof is a bowling allrounder, and he'll be expected to bowl 10 overs. Mahela Jayawardene will need to get ten more out of his part-timers, Tillakaratne Dilshan's thumb has probably healed enough for him to bowl several overs.
Joab: "@John: I Would Argue that Warner has missed half a Match not fielding in the Brisbane game. He appears to have some fitness issues."
Dan: "...but gets cramp after batting for maybe 30 overs won't be able to have a runner." If the player is injured in the match, he can get a runner, isn't that the way it goes?" No, runners are a thing of the past in international cricket. No runners under any circumstances under the revised rules.
Kangon: "Re Bowlers: I think Kapugedra can bowl some medium pacers, also Lahiru "I got Hussey's wicket" Thirimanne also there."
Meety has some advice for MS Dhoni, a little too late though: "The Warner issue is a loophole that Dhoni should have exploited. He should when winning the toss, bat first, then have Sehwag, Gambhir & Sachin claim groin injuries & save 20 runs in the field!"
1.00 pm Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage of the second final of the CB Series. It may also be the final final if Sri Lanka don't win at Adelaide Oval. Australia went up 1-0 in Brisbane after overcoming a serious scare from the unlikeliest of batsmen - Nuwan Kulasekara.
We're about 20 minutes away from the toss, the questions over the XIs are whether Angelo Mathews and David Warner will be fit enough to play. Daniel Brettig has more match information in his preview.
 Innings Start
9.30 pm As far as chases of substantial totals go, this is as strong as they come. Sri Lanka, through a poor performance in the field, were faced with a target of 272 and they've gunned it down with eight wickets in hand and 34 balls to spare. It's been a memorable performance from Jayawardene, Dilshan and the rest. Dilshan is the obvious choice for Man of the Match, having opening the bowling and taken a wicket during ten economical overs, before scoring a century.
"ROAR!!!" says Dinusha.
Anton: "It's Sri Lanka 4 and Australia 2. No matter what happens on Thursday I am proud of lads performance."
The presentation is imminent ...
Clarke says he's done something to his left hamstring. "It doesn't feel great." He says he'll know more about it tomorrow. "Our bowling was poor, our fielding let us down. On good wickets you need to maximise your Powerplay, you need to make 300 on that wicket. The boys are working hard, we are just not executing against quality opposition. We've got to find a way."
Mahela: "We were dropping catches like hot potatoes. Disappointed. We bowled well up front, but gave them about 20 runs extra."
Mahela says he had no issues about the full toss no-ball, he just had an issue about the late call and Clarke having a word with the umpire. He says he thinks he's been fined for that outburst, and if he gets paid he'll cough up. Hilarious. "No one gave us a chance when we came to Australia, we've done a lot of hard work, we just need to do that on Thursday, execute our game plan."
Dilshan is the Man of the Match: "I'm really enjoying my batsman at the moment ... It doesn't matter I'm captain or not ...if the ball is there, I'm going to hit. When we came here everyone thought we are not that good, but we've shown how good we are."
So the CB Series finals is level at 1-1, with the decider on Thursday. Do join us for that game. That's all I've got for you today, thank you for all your emails. Cheers.
