So New Zealand are set a funny old target of 226.These middle of the road targets can sometimes be tricky. I don't think Australia will be too thrilled with this but at least it's an improvement from the previous game. Hussey and Clarke consolidated for a long period and looked to set a platform for a bigger score but New Zealand deserve credit for bowling intelligently. The fielding was also impressive and the body language was positive too. Having said that, Clarke and Hussey did well for themselves.
This is going to be an interesting chase. Let's see if McCullum can fire today. Taking you through the second half is Siddhartha Talya. Join us in around half an hour. Cheers for now! And by the way, there's the IPL auction to give you company...

 Innings Start
Australia have slid to their fifth consecutive defeat, that too at home. 226 was a competitive target on a slow pitch but New Zealand paced their innings brilliantly. They started patiently and McCullum was involved in two 40-plus partnerships with Fulton and Taylor to ensure his team didn;t lose early wickets. Taylor then added 72 with Elliot, but despite his dismissal, New Zealand were always in the hunt. Broom gave good support to Elliot, who made an unbeaten 61, and helped see his team through to a victory and a 2-0 lead.
Michael Clarke is the Man of the Match for his 98.
Clarke: "We fell a few runs short. The wicket was a little slow, and the spinners bowled pretty well, and I think I could have scored a little bit quicker. Our bowlers did a pretty good job, but we couldn't tighten them up in the middle overs. We need to close these games off, and be a little more positive and go for wickets than just try to contain them."
Vettori gets a huge cheer. "We've bowled exceptionally, especially Kyle Mills. Ross Taylor and Elliot batted superbly, so did Neil Broom and the fact that the youngsters are doing well shapes up really well for New Zealand cricket."
I know its Broom and not Warner. Sorry for the typo there, and thanks for pointing it out. Anyway, its been an exciting match and hopefully the next one in Sydney, on February 8, will be just as good. Australia have to win that to stay in the series. Until then, it's goodbye from all of us here at Cricinfo. Adios!

Welcome back to the run chase. Kanishkaa has returned to his desk, and it's Siddhartha Talya taking over.
Australia made New Zealand work hard for what seemed like a paltry 181 in the first ODI, so getting 226 will not be all that easy. The visitors will hope for a better display from their top order, particularly McCullum, who hasn't scored a fifty in nine innings.
The latest from the IPL auction is that Mashrafe Mortaza, the Bangladesh fast bowler, has been bought for a whopping $600,000 by Kolkata Knight Riders.
All set for the start here, Bracken to bowl to McCullum
