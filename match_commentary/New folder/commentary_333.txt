4.25pm: So, around 25 minutes late, the England innings ends (expect a potential fine for Australia due to the over rate) - and both sides will probably talk up their respective positions. England might have made more, given the start their top three gave them, but will feel that total is defendable. Australia pulled it back with some disciplined bowling in the last 15 overs - can the batsmen produce something equally doughty? Join us again shortly to find out

15.3;1;Watson to Bell, 1 run dragged down short, Bell is coming forward then rocks back to pull through square leg;

12.6;1lb;McKay to Bell, 1 leg bye hit on the pad walking across his stumps, McKay lets out a lone gargle of an appeal - probably sliding down leg, though the replay shows it to have been a pretty close call, maybe tickling the top of the stump;

12.4;?;McKay to Bell, no run pitched up outside the line of off, defended;

11.5;?;Watson to Trott, no run length ball in the corridor outside off stump, gets across to defend;
11.4;W;Watson to Cook, OUT he's done it, Watson makes the breakthrough, drawing Cook into a drive to be caught behind! Cook will feel he should have pinged that through the covers, it was a little wide, on a good length but they've not had any problems hitting on the up this morning - just a thin snick of bat and Cook trudges off having made another solid start but failed to go on;Alastair Cook c ?Wade b Watson 30 (55m 42b 3x4 0x6) SR: 71.42;
11.3;?;Watson to Cook, no run stays in the crease and plays towards point;

9.2;?;Watson to Bell, no run better length, comes forward and defends around off;
9.1;4;Watson to Bell, FOUR runs woof, there's nothing too dazzling about that from the bowler's point of view, wide half-volley and Bell spanks it straight back past Watson for a howdy-do-dee four;
8.6;?;McKay to Cook, no run line and length outside off, stands tall and taps square;
8.5;?;McKay to Cook, no run length ball, angled across but offering Cook width, he scythes the bat through a meaty cut but Warner pulls off a terrific diving stop to take the ball on the bounce and save his side a boundary;
8.4;?;McKay to Cook, no run pushed across, again probably a touch full, Cook doesn't time his drive towards the man at extra cover;
8.3;?;McKay to Cook, no run pitched up around the line of off, punched back towards mid-off;

7.4;1;Johnson to Cook, 1 run gets across and tucks one through square leg;
7.3;4;Johnson to Cook, FOUR runs Johnson gets the boundary treatment now, full and wide of the stumps, the ball isn't doing anything threatening through the air or off the pitch and Cook confidently punches another four through the covers;
7.2;1lb;Johnson to Bell, 1 leg bye straighter, attempts to tuck off his pads but doesn't get any bat on it;
7.1;?;Johnson to Bell, no run that's an excellent line from Johnson to Bell, speared across and lifting sharply, the batsman has his off stump covered but is drawn into a bit of a flirt anyway;

5.5;?;Johnson to Bell, no run fired across on a good length, going on with the arm, Bell lets it through;

5.3;2;Johnson to Cook, 2 runs full, veering towards leg stump, glanced in front of square by Cook and the back on the boundary covers good ground to prevent a boundary;
5.2;?;Johnson to Cook, no run tighter line and blocked into the leg side;
5.1;?;Johnson to Cook, no run back of a length, outside off and flayed off the back foot, picks out point though;

4.5;?;McKay to Bell, no run length delivery in the channel, not doing much off the straight and Bell shoulders arms;
4.4;4;McKay to Bell, FOUR runs overpitched again, Bell drives uppishly but into a gap, this has more middle about it and beats the chasing fielder to the extra cover boundary;

4.2;?;McKay to Bell, no run nipping back off the surface, wide of the stumps and Bell is happy to leave;
4.1;?;McKay to Bell, no run gets his radar functioning, homing in around off stump and blocked;
4.1;1w;McKay to Bell, 1 wide well, if anything that's a worse start - "we've had Defreitas at the Gabba, now it's Harmison," mutters Gnasher to my right - as a length ball just about lands on the cut strip and swings towards first slip;
3.6;?;Johnson to Cook, no run pitched up outside the line of off, textbook front-foot drive from Cook but he picks mid-off;
3.5;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run sharp bouncer from Johnson, he's working up decent pace and this gets big on Bell, who thrusts his hands at it and does well to keep it down towards gully;
3.4;1;Johnson to Cook, 1 run pitched up a foot or so outside off, Cook chops down on it and the ball squirts through midwicket;
3.3;2;Johnson to Cook, 2 runs Cook gets forward and clips firmly off his front pad through midwicket, touch too full and straight again from Johnson;
3.2;?;Johnson to Cook, no run cracked off the back foot towards point, plenty of power on the shot but David Warner makes a customarily smart stop;
3.1;?;Johnson to Cook, no run full and wide and beats Cook driving, it swung a touch though it was probably one to be leaving at this stage, even in one-day mode;
2.6;?;Starc to Bell, no run short of a length, on the stumps and defended from the crease;
2.5;4;Starc to Bell, FOUR runs full and wide, angled across Bell who steps out and elegantly laces four through the covers, super timing;
2.4;?;Starc to Bell, no run goes back and across to defend a shortish ball outside off;
2.3;1;Starc to Cook, 1 run edged, Cook pushes with hard hands but gets enough bat on it to take it wide of second slip for a single to third man;
2.2;2;Starc to Cook, 2 runs pitched up, Cook goes for a heave straight out of the farmyard, so agricultural was it, more air than distance but it clears mid-off for a couple;
2.2;3nb;Starc to Cook, (no ball) 2 runs confusion, appeals, overthrows, chaos! Starc oversteps to concede a no-ball and Cook then has to scramble back to just beat a direct hit from point, Bell had gone charging down the pitch anyway, the ball deflects through midwicket after clipping the bails and they pick up a couple anyway;
2.1;?;Starc to Cook, no run on the pads, slightly full but Cook can't tuck it away this time;
1.6;1;Johnson to Cook, 1 run back of a length and wide, opens the arms and cracks a cut shot down to third man for a single to deny Mitch a maiden;
1.5;?;Johnson to Cook, no run lovely delivery from Johnson, angled in on a testing length and nipping away as Cook prods at it and is beaten;
1.4;?;Johnson to Cook, no run full and holding its line on off stump, again Cook gets his bat down in time;

1.2;?;Johnson to Cook, no run slightly overpitched, again a little leg side, shovelled towards backward square;
1.1;?;Johnson to Cook, no run in the channel outside off, better first ball from this Mitch, Cook leaves;

0.5;?;Starc to Bell, no run back of a length and at the body, tapped short into the leg side;
0.4;?;Starc to Bell, no run angled across on a good length outside off stump, good carry through to the keeper as Bell leaves;
0.3;1;Starc to Cook, 1 run full and sliding on to the pads again, worked finer, towards long leg, Cook wants two but they decide against doing anything silly;
0.2;?;Starc to Cook, no run good length, in the channel outside off stump, much better line and Cook shoulders arms as it shapes away;
0.1;4;Starc to Cook, FOUR runs overpitched on leg stump, nice juicy volley to begin with from Starc and Cook clumps it through backward square with relish, to raucous cheering from around the ground;

Mitchell Starc has the ball in hand, Alastair Cook standing tall... are you ready for this? Hang on, Cook isn't, there's someone moving behind the bowler's arm. Tum-ti-tum. Let's try again...
10.27am: It's a little cloudy over Edgbaston but the pitch is expected to be pretty hard and dry. "An absolute belter," is Shane Warne's verdict. Remember, India and Sri Lanka scored over 600 on this track in a warm-up fixture during the week...
By the way, you can also follow the match with Gnasher on our social scorecard. It's got graphs, tweets and whizzy stuff like that.
10.25am: The teams are strolling out for the anthems, a few sparklers having just gone off on the outfield. For apple types, at this juncture I'd like to point you in the direction of our new iPhone app, available from the iTunes store. Click, click, click.
10.20am: Australia, it should be remembered, have won their last six ODIs, including a whitewash of West Indies; they'll be hoping to chip away at England's still-fragile confidence in this format, as New Zealand did to good effect over the last week. As far as Ashes omens go, if Bailey and co can engineer a surprise victory, it may well carry echoes of the meeting between these two in the 2004 Champions Trophy, also at Edgbaston, ahead of the epic 2005 series.
"I love how warm-ups seem to only be relevant to form when Australia lose," grumbles James, trying to spoil everyone's fun. "We beat West Indies in the other warm-up and they went all right yesterday."
Ashif, meanwhile, thinks England are up to something... "No Swann and Finn? I smell a conspiracy theory."
And here's Ian: "It would be nice if the young Aussie bowling attack could fire collectively at last today. There's a lot of talent there, I wonder if Starc, Faulkner and Mckay have the composure to threaten the English top order?"
10.10am: Okay, have you updated your Ashes swingometer, then? An injury to Swann (though we don't know how serious it is) will cause a shiver down the spine of many England fans but Tredwell is a very capable deputy, as he showed against New Zealand the other day, as well as in the fifth Australia ODI last summer.
"Here we go!" chirps Mark "The phoney war before the great battle. Both sides will claim that this is a meaningless game and will have no influence on anything. Both sides are sporting a cauliflower ear from their previous battle. It might be meaningless (especially to the neutrals), but there is a lot of pride at stake."
Ryan, meanwhile, think Australia may have overestimated English conditions in this (so far) sunny June: "Why on earth have Australia picked a team with 6 fast bowlers and no spinner? We are in England sure but haven't they seen the games so far? Spin has been king in the middle overs"
10am: England win the toss and bat, there's no - *intake of breath* - Graeme Swann or Steven Finn in their XI. Swann pulled up with a sore back, with Finn left out on grounds of form. James Tredwell plays, as does Ravi Bopara, so England have already abandoned their five batsmen, five seamers masterplan in their first game of the tournament.
Australia, meanwhile, have named the same side that lost to India but that 200-plus margin in the warm-up fixture. Stand-in captain, George Bailey, seems chipper enough and think that being underdogs might suit them. Oh, how times have changed.
England 1 Alastair Cook (capt), 2 Ian Bell, 3 Jonathan Trott, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Jos Buttler (wk) 8 Tim Bresnan, 9 Stuart Broad, 10 James Tredwell, 11 James Anderson
Australia 1 Shane Watson, 2 David Warner, 3 Phil Hughes, 4 George Bailey (capt), 5 Adam Voges, 6 Mitchell Marsh, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 James Faulkner, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Mitchell Starc, 11 Clint McKay
9.50am: Good morning, welcome, step inside - we're having a pre-Ashes party. Not that anyone's calling it that, despite this being the first skirmish in an eight-month war. Today is all about the Champions Trophy, the last trinket on Australia's mantelpiece. The last time Australia arrived on an Ashes tour, they held the World Cup and Champions Trophy - they're after a "three-peat" in this competition - as well as the urn but, as Brydon Coverdale points out in his preview, a bit of form ahead of you-know-what might be the best they can ask for. England know a fair bit about about crumbling empires but they go into this tournament, in home conditions, with a blueprint that has made them among the favourites, despite the series defeat to New Zealand. Australia, without their captain, Michael Clarke, and with 65 on their mind, will still fancy their chances of landing a couple of psychological blows... David Hopps' preview is the final piece of today's pre-match jigsaw and we'll have news of the toss shortly.
 Innings Start
That's it from Edgbaston, England underway with a win and now have a few days to take stock, their next game comes on Thursday against Sri Lanka in Cardiff. A day before that fixture, Australia play their next game, that's against New Zealand back in Birmingham again. Tomorrow it's down to Cardiff for the second match in Group A, Sri Lanka and New Zealand getting underway at 10.30 BST so tune in then but from Gnasher, Monty and myself, Alex Winter, it's goodbye for now.

Here's the Presentation. "We were a partnership short with the bat we couldn't get anything going," stand-in losing captain George Bailey says. "From 1 for 170 we did a really job to pull it back wit the ball, it looked a very good batting deck. But if it's going to be that dry then we probably need a spinner."

"It was a good performances all-round, the pitch got slower and lower after 30 overs," Alastair Cook said. "We should have got around 300 from where we were 180 for 2 but i thought 270 was good enough. When they were 30 off 10 I thought Jimmy and Broady were exceptional."

Man of the Match goes to Ian Bell for his top-score of the day, 91 in 115 balls. He led England's innings very well.

For Australia, that was a very disappointing second innings. They started very quietly and then lost wickets, the worst of the worst. Thereafter only George Bailey got stuck in and made a score and by the time James Faulkner knocked it around down the order it was too late. It looked an out-of-form order lacking in quality. They have a real job on their hands to give Sri Lanka and New Zealand a game. Saying that, they were facing an exceptionally disciplined bowling attack, England gave them nothing.

Fine performance with the ball from England and they have won by 48 runs, a very comfortable victory in the end. They would have been nervous after a sluggish effort with the bat that saw them fall 20 or 30 runs short of what many though was par in good batting conditions. England lost their power hitters cheaply and Ravi Bopara was needed to prop up their total. But it was more than good enough because with the ball, England have strangled Australia, they never got going and were never really in the chase.

42.4;W;Bopara to Johnson, OUT full toss comes off high on the bat and loops to point. Oh dear Mitchell, a waist-high full toss, he's tried to slug it over the off side but is too late on the stroke and chipped up an easy catch to Morgan, they umpires had a quick check for the height of the delivery but concurred that it was fine;Mitchell Johnson c Morgan b Bopara 8 (18m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80;

39.3;1;Tredwell to Faulkner, 1 run flicked to midwicket and they take a quick run, there's a dive back in as the throw comes in from Morgan at midwicket, Buttler takes it very well and turns with his gloves backwards to the stumps having dived past the timbers and I think Johnson is short of his ground, the bat is over the line but in the air and I reckon the bail is out of its groove. Apparently not! Not out given, well the third umpire, Billy Bowden, wanted to be 100% sure and he obviously wasn't;

35.6;W;Anderson to Wade, OUT full and sliding past the outside edge, taken by the keeper and given out! Umpire Dharmasena nodded his head for the edge, they're going to check whether it carried to Buttler. There was no hesitation from Buttler who threw it up straight away, Hot Spot confirms a thin edge too, there was a nervy look behind by Wade as it went past the bat, definitely out, no idea why Wade his hanging around for, he's gone;Matthew Wade c ?Buttler b Anderson 1 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;

32.4;W;Bresnan to Voges, OUT Voges swings, misses and is bowled, Bresnan strikes for England! Looked like a little offcutter, rolling his fingers over the ball and it jinked back just enough off the pitch as Voges tried to hit down the ground, beat the bat on the inside and clattered into the top of middle and off stump;Adam Voges b Bresnan 15 (27m 23b 1x4 0x6) SR: 65.21;

25.4;W;Root to Hughes, OUT skids on, Hughes plays an ugly swipe across the line and is hit in front - Dharmasena gives it! That was a horrible shot from Hughes, he was getting tied down by Root's gentle offies, he tried to pull the ball off a length and was struck in front of middle and leg; the question was whether it would clip leg but Dharmasena was happy enough and Hughes decides against reviewing;Phillip Hughes lbw b Root 30 (78m 55b 3x4 0x6) SR: 54.54;

12.4;1;Bresnan to Hughes, 1 run played a bit firmer into the gully and is this another tough chance to Cook? It went ever so quickly to him from a flashing blade and it carried again to his diving left-hand but again he couldn't cling on to what would have been a pearler;
