12.50pm We have hardly recovered from the IPL, and the World Twenty20 is already upon us. And before the real event, we start off our live coverage with warm-up games today.
It's a gloriously hot day in Nottingham and we are set to have full practice matches, starting with Australia against Bangladesh at 1.30pm. Team news and toss to follow.
 Innings Start
So Australia have come out with their full might for the warm-up game. They played full-strength, hit the ground running, and got a big total. Bangaldesh had some merry time in the initial overs, but the high-risk game they played it was never going to come off. Both teams will be pleased with their batting, but will have identified issues with their bowling.
From the TV viewers' point of view, big news: Paul Allott is back, Bob Willis is not. Thanks for joining us. Okay bye
