Data
9.05pm: After a blistering opening stand of 75, South Africa managed just 29 runs from the last five overs, as Australia set up a very effective roadblock. Pat Cummins again looked the business - now the batsmen must try to seal the deal. The consensus seems to be that 145 is short of par but SA at least had an excellent tutorial in how to bowl on this pitch in the second half of the innings. We'll go a-chasing together in 15.
Here's Dr. Haroon with some wisdom at the interval: "A while ago everyone was questioning the tactics of Finch and now, as the course of innings has changed, everyone has started to praise the 'brilliant' tactics of Australia. Cricket is a funny game and life is funnier where no one owns a failure and even a bad tactic is praised if it delivers."
19.6;2;Cummins to Peterson, 2 runs short, again taking the pace off, Peterson shovels it awkwardly into the leg side, deep midwicket has a lot of ground to cover and they come scrambling back for the second - still, a magnificent over from Cummins at the last;
19.5;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run banged in halfway down and pulled forcefully but too close to deep midwicket, Peterson half-heartedly sets off for a second but has to go back;
19.4;1;Cummins to Peterson, 1 run slower ball, Peterson drops right back in the crease and deflects it to point, Miller was already halfway down;
19.3;?;Cummins to Peterson, no run back of a length, cutting his fingers over it, Peterson swipes and misses;
19.2;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run another bumper, connects with this one, swatted into the deep but they're kept to a single;
19.1;?;Cummins to Miller, no run dug in short and there's a big appeal as Miller aims a pull, deflects through to the keeper - well spotted, ump, that came off the shoulder;
18.6;1;Faulkner to Miller, 1 run uses the feet and swings hard at a length ball, big top edge but it sails safely out towards deep cover to keep Miller on strike;
18.5;4;Faulkner to Miller, FOUR runs HEADS! Faulkner has to take evasive action here, slightly too full and Miller nearly turns killer with a scud missile of a drive straight back down the pitch. Phwoar;
18.4;1;Faulkner to Peterson, 1 run shortish, Peterson comes forward and slices a single to backward point;
18.3;W;Faulkner to Wiese, OUT gone first ball, edging a pull through to the keeper! Two in three balls for Faulkner, the slump continues. It was another back-of-a-length delivery, Wiese hadn't got his eye in and succeeded only in feathering it through to Dunk;David Wiese c ?Dunk b Faulkner 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
18.2;1;Faulkner to Miller, 1 run back of a length, Miller steps away and drags one down the ground to long-on;
18.1;W;Faulkner to Duminy, OUT tries to get to the pitch, Duminy lifts a length ball to deep midwicket! Another one goes, the SA innings is dribbling to a close... He was hitting across the line and didn't really get hold of it;Jean-Paul Duminy c Maxwell b Faulkner 2 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40;
17.6;1;Cummins to Duminy, 1 run Cummins continues to hit the middle of the pitch and limit the pace the batsman has to use again him, swatted into the midwicket region, they think about two but the fielder is quickly in;
17.5;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run short, another cutter, pulled flat out towards deep midwicket;
17.4;1b;Cummins to Duminy, 1 bye another slower-ball bumper, down the leg side - maybe lucky not to be a wide - Duminy swings and misses but the low bounce foxes Dunk and they take a bye;
17.3;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run slower ball from Cummins, short again and cross-batted through the leg side;
17.2;1;Cummins to Duminy, 1 run short again, Duminy swats a pull away into the midwicket region;

16.6;4;Faulkner to Miller, FOUR runs too full and Miller scorches a drive down the ground, wide of long-off, a powerful counterpunch to finish the over;
16.5;2;Faulkner to Miller, 2 runs short again, Faulkner making the batsmen go square of the wicket, pulled into the deep for a couple;
16.4;W;Faulkner to Behardien, OUT shortish and taken on... only to pick out deep midwicket! Behardien's brief, painful sally is brought to a close, slogging across the line but never had to the distance to that part of the ground;Farhaan Behardien c Abbott b Faulkner 1 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;

15.4;1lb;Bollinger to Behardien, 1 leg bye leg-stump line again, aims to leg and the ball rolls away off the pad;
15.3;?;Bollinger to Behardien, no run skips down the pitch and tries to heave a length ball over midwicket, swings and misses;
15.2;W;Bollinger to Hendricks, OUT Dougie does it, Hendricks drags on! The ball was short and there to pull but maybe Bollinger had rolled his fingers over it, the batsman misjudged the stroke, bottom-edged the ball on to his body and then down to shiver leg stump. Falls just short of the fifty mark, like his opening partner;Reeza Hendricks b Bollinger 49 (48b 5x4 0x6) SR: 102.08;

11.1;W;Boyce to Rossouw, OUT tossed up, Rossouw charges... and picks out long-on! Success for Boyce, he keeps tossing it up, Rossouw was trying to clear the short, straight boundary - the ball was a little wide, he wasn't to the pitch and dragged it straight to the fielder;Rilee Rossouw c Abbott b Boyce 4 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
10.6;?;Cummins to Hendricks, no run slightly fuller, Hendricks closes the face and again works the ball to midwicket - another dot and an excellent over from Cummins, having been hit for four second ball;

8.4;W;Cummins to de Kock, OUT got him, Cummins makes the breakthrough with a fast short ball! Banged in, little bit of cut on the ball and de Kock was hurried trying to pull, just a tickle of glove and it's safely pouched by Dunk;Quinton de Kock c ?Dunk b Cummins 48 (27b 5x4 2x6) SR: 177.77;
8.3;6;Cummins to de Kock, SIX runs slower ball, de Kock hasn't picked this... but he's still hit it for six! He was aiming down the ground and that's where it ended up, just managing to clear the rope despite the miscue;

Doug Bollinger to Quinton de Kock. Here we go!
Here come the teams, the stadium slowly filling up. The pitch looks hard and porridge coloured; watch out for the straight boundaries here...
7.30pm: We've had two mismatches in the series so far - here's hoping for a genuinely competitive match to decide things. We'll be cracking on at Sydney's Olympic Stadium in five.
"Why leave out Tahir???" chunters Peter. "He's one of the top limited overs spinners in the world and should be in every T20 and ODI match that SA play. The more he plays the better he bowls. Can't see us fielding two spinners in the World Cup so what's the point? Peterson's better batting is not worth it."
Kevin, however, thinks Immy has earned some feet-up time: "It's great that McLaren and Tahir were rested. They're both regulars for the ODI side and could use a break. Also good to see Wiese finally get a go. He is a great striker of the ball and a handy medium pacer."
7.20pm: Is it me or do Australia have a lot of openers in their line-up? I assume Ben Dunk will keep his favoured spot at the top of the order... but Maddinson (or White, or Watson) could also join Finch. Anyway, it is Quinny de Kock and Reeza Hendricks we will be seeing first. SA will be hoping to put the slow-motion car crash of Friday behind them straight away.
Chris Nugent is first out of the postbag today: "Someone please explain why there has been no Marchant de Lange?" Kagiso Rabada was the young buck given a run-out in the first two games... but Marchant is included today, Chris. This will be his first T20 international since February 2012.
7.05pm: Australia have won the toss and will field, they have made one change to their side: Nic Maddinson coming in for Nathan Reardon. South Africa have shaken things up after being hammered in Melbourne, with David Wiese, Robbie Peterson and Marchant de Lange all coming into the XI.
Australia: 1 Aaron Finch (capt), 2 Ben Dunk (wk), 3 Shane Watson, 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Cameron White, 6 Nic Maddinson, 7 James Faulkner, 8 Sean Abbott, 9 Pat Cummins, 10 Cameron Boyce, 11 Doug Bollinger
South Africa: 1 Quinton de Kock (wk), 2 Reeza Hendricks, 3 Rilee Rossouw, 4 JP Duminy (capt), 5 David Miller, 6 Farhaan Behardien, 7 David Wiese, 8 Robin Peterson, 9 Wayne Parnell, 10 Kyle Abbott, 11 Marchant de Lange
7.04pm: Evening all, welcome to the game that's being billed almost nowhere as The Decider. Australia and South Africa are level at 1-1 with the final T20 to play - you can gen up with Daniel Brettig's match preview and then get ready for the live, typey-tappy action with me, Alan Gardner.
 Innings Start
11.20pm: Think that's it from the Sydney Olympic Stadium, we had a few snatched quotes from the players to win gongs. Thanks for your comments, as ever, we'll be back for more white-ball high jinks when the one-dayers begin on Friday. If you haven't already had enough, you can follow India's chase against Sri Lanka - they've been set 243 to win the series in Hyderabad - or pick up a different rhythm with Pakistan's batsmen in the Abu Dhabi Test. From me, for now, it's goodbye and good luck. Ta ra
Man of the Match is that man, the man, Cameron White: "Got a little bit twitchy there. It was set up by the bowlers, chasing 140 should be pretty comfortable most times, we got there in the end. I thought we bowled really well at the back end, used the conditions well and pressured them after a good start. It's nice to be making runs, that's my job, so hopefully keep doing it."
James Faulkner is named Man of the Series: "To say the least, it was very tense. I've been in that position before, stuffed it up - it was nerve-wracking, Cam played really well. He's pure class and good to see him perform. [Boyce, Cummins progress] I've been impressed with him showcasing his skills in T20 and it's exciting to see a legspinner doing well. Pat Cummins as well, bowling fast and taking wickets. We're ready for the summer, hopefully go well over the next few months, both personally and the team."
11pm: Well, that was the sort of finish we were after, a zinger of a T20 that see-sawed back and forth throughout. Australia take the series 2-1 and they have the cool head and steady of hands of Cameron White to thank. South Africa fought for the whole nine yards but really paid for stumbling through the second half of their innings, when they were 61 for 5. Glenn Maxwell should go and have a chat with White about how to finish a run chase, by the way... But no harm done in the end, the teams can now move on and prepare for five ODIs in the next two weeks.
19.5;1;Abbott to White, 1 run full bunger in the blockhole, White chops it away to midwicket, it's not taken cleanly and he's off, charging through for the winning run - Australia win by two wickets with one last itty-bitty ball to spare!;

15.2;?;de Lange to White, no run back of a length, turned short to the on side;

12.5;W;Peterson to Maxwell, OUT Maxwell whirls the arms but this is a huge top edge... superbly taken on the run by deep midwicket!

12.1;1;Peterson to White, 1 run on the stumps, reverse sweep and de Kock anticipates it, taking some of the pace off;
11.6;4;Wiese to Maxwell, FOUR runs impudent, super flicked four from Maxwell, waiting to play the pull shot really late and directing it fine of the boundary rider;

11.4;?;Wiese to White, no run length ball, punched into the ground and Wiese snatches it reaching to his right, then throws down the stumps as White regains his ground... Wiese makes sure the ricochet doesn't cost a run, either. Good work;
11.3;1;Wiese to Maxwell, 1 run another cutter, worked away through the leg side;

8.1;W;Peterson to Watson, OUT a wicket follows a wide again, Watson ballooning a drive to extra cover running back!

8.1;1w;Peterson to Watson, 1 wide fired through, down the leg side as Watson attempts to sweep;
7.6;W;Wiese to Maddinson, OUT or maybe that was a bit of luck, as Maddinson plays on!

7.6;2w;Wiese to Watson, 2 wide Wiese might be a bit unfortunate here, short, slower ball, over the ducking Watson, the bounce defeats de Kock and they run an extra on the wide;

6.5;?;Peterson to Maddinson, no run over the wicket, flat and outside off, punched into the covers;
6.4;W;Peterson to Dunk, OUT on the attack again - but he's hit it straight into Peterson's bread basket! Really sharp catch and he squeals in celebration... Dunk didn't get to the pitch this time, the ball maybe gripped a little and hit higher up the bat, still flew pretty quickly but Peterson was alert to grab the chance;Ben Dunk c & b Peterson 14 (8b 0x4 1x6) SR: 175;

4.5;?;Wiese to Watson, no run slightly full outside off, Watson comes forward and opens the face towards point;
4.4;W;Wiese to Finch, OUT oh, gone, shovelled to backward square leg! Finch knew what he'd done as soon as he hit it, pulling a genuine short ball straight to the fielder.

4.3;?;Wiese to Finch, no run cutter from Wiese, rolls the fingers over it, Finch defends;

3.6;?;Parnell to Dunk, no run better length, skids on and deflects off the body towards backward point;

2.1;1;Abbott to Dunk, 1 run squirts a single towards point;
