Data
Australia, stung by the defeat to Zimbabwe, have been clinical here today. Excellent bowling all round, particularly from Nathan Bracken and Mitchell Johnson, who proclaims himself "quite happy with who we've performed". Australia, if they put their minds to it and finish the job quickly, could dump England out of the competition here. "People are now scurrying around," reports Gnasher McGlashan, "trying to work out the final calculations to see what the cut-off is for England to get knocked-out on net run-rate." (Several minutes elapse) "According to the tournament stats man, Australia have to knock-off the runs in 9.3 overs for England to go out. That's unlikely." Join Martin in a few minutes for the chase.

0.5;1;Lee to Prior, 1 run dropped into the leg side, a quick single, Maddy, the non striker, ran in a straight line and Lee swerved across the pitch and the two collided ... Maddy got home safely and it was Lee who was left on the turf;
0.4;?;Lee to Prior, no run wider, 85mph, no shot offered;
0.3;?;Lee to Prior, no run fuller, driven but not timed, his top hand comes off the bat as he plays the stroke and it dribbles to mid-off;
0.2;?;Lee to Prior, no run back of a length, on off stump, Prior half forward and defends to point;
0.1;1;Lee to Maddy, 1 run forward defensive to a slow loosener, drops into the on side, no more than a few yards, and a scurried single to loud cheers;

2.00pm Out they all come, and if the man on the PA ever shuts up then we might get going ... Brett Lee with the new ball ...
1.55pm It's bright and sunny and we are ready to go. A reminder ... if Australia lose then they are out and England and Zimbabwe are through to the Super Eights. If Australia win then all three sides are level on points and it comes down to Net Run Rate, but Australia will be through as they will have a better NRR and it will between England and Zimbabwe. All clear?
1.45pm Ponting again: "It's a fine line in this game, you've got to back yourself and take your chances."
Pietersen spoke overnight of wanting to "humiliate" Australia, to which a beaming Ponting responds: "First time for everything, we'll wait and see how we go today."
In his column he wrote of the Zimbabwe match earlier this week: "I didn't say a whole lot to the players after the game, but I had a few words about it being a real wake-up for us. We were totally on for the match. Or we talked as if we were. We just didn't play like it. We have to start respecting the game more and thinking of what we have to do."
1.40pm England have won the toss and will bat. "Slightly strange decision from England, in that batting second would have allowed them to be control of the chase and know exactly what they need to go through," says Dr Andrew McGlashan from pitchside.
"It's a good pitch, nice sunny day and hopefully we can get some runs on the board," explains Paul Collingwood who adds that he is looking for improvements in the way England field and bowl. "Our fielding generally wasn't up to our usual standards, hopefully we can improve on that today. It would be nice today to win the game and go through, it doesn't matter who we knock out."
"I was actually going to have a bowl today anyway," says Ricky Ponting. Of course.
1.35pm Only the one change for either side, Australia bring in Michael Clarke for Brad Haddin, while for England James Kirtley comes in for Jimmy Anderson.
Australia Adam Gilchrist (wk), Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting (capt), Andrew Symonds, Mike Hussey, Brad Hodge, Michael Clarke, Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clark.
England Darren Maddy, Matt Prior (wk), Luke Wright, Kevin Pietersen, Paul Collingwood (capt), Andrew Flintoff, Owais Shah, Dimitri Mascarenhas, Chris Schofield, Stuart Broad, James Kirtley.
12.55pm Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's ball-by-ball commentary of the ninth match of the ICC World Twenty20 - and it's a biggie today. England take on Australia in a match that has taken on extra significance after Zimbabwe's shock victory in the opening rubber of Group B. If Australia fail to secure a victory today, they are on their way home - and Kevin Pietersen, for one, is gleeful at the prospect of inflicting some "humiliation" on Ricky Ponting's men.
Andrew McGlashan, our man on the spot, reports that the weather is glorious in the Western Cape today: "still a little chilly, but blue skies." Both teams are out in the middle warming up. More news as we get it
 Innings Start
This has been a different Australia today to the one which lost to Zimbabwe the other day. And, ominously for the rest of the teams in this tournament, they look like their old serves: dominant and clinical. Hayden finishes with 67 not out; he remained unruffled throughout. Emphatic is the word, and Ponting and his men have certainly started to take this tournament seriously. So, England and Australia through to the Super Eights, then, and Zimbabwe are out - on an inferior run rate.
Ponting states the obvious: "We're a fair bit happier today. Today was a pretty comprehensive win. We did the job with the bat today." Collingwood ends how he started - by admitting there are areas that England need to improve on, particularly the batting. True enough. Bracken picks up the Man of the Match award for an intelligent, controlled spell of bowling that helped to knock over England.
Thanks for joining us today. Next up will be India's tussle with Pakistan so do switch over to the live scorecard for that match coming up shortly.
From me, Jenny Thompson and Martin Williamson (with Andrew Miller on bulletin duty), it's goodbye.

2.1;4;Broad to Gilchrist, FOUR runs short and wide, Gilchrist slashes and a thick top edge flies over the grasp of the leaping Prior;
1.6;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run driven hard back to the bowler, the ball bounces kindly allowing Flintoff to collect in his follow through;

0.1;?;Broad to Gilchrist, no run inswinging and full, dug out into the leg side;

We are ready ... England huddle and cuddle and exchange morale-boosting words as Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden pass them. Simple equation. Australia have to win to go through, and if they knock off the runs in under 9.3 overs then England are eliminated. If they don't but still win then Zimbabwe take the short journey home. Stuart Broad at the Kelvin Grove End.
