8.40pm This innings has taken 100 minutes. That tells you how much retrieving people have had to do from the stands. It's a good job they let Gayle face only 41 balls. Imagine if he had got about 60. Then again, they were so scared of Gayle they didn't seem to execute against the others. Have Gayle and his big-hitting friends killed this off? You will find out soon enough, when Alex Winter brings you the second innings. This is Sidharth Monga, and his nephew, singing off...

19.6;W;Doherty to Pollard, OUT oh finally a mis-hit finds a fielder. Pollard is looking for a fourth straight six, but this time he slices it high, high, high, and Warner takes a safe catch at long-off. Warner will have to do much more with the bat if we are going to have a match tonight;Kieron Pollard c Warner b Doherty 38 (22m 15b 3x4 3x6) SR: 253.33;
19.5;6;Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs Gayle is dancing already. First 200 of the tournament. Full, middle and leg, smoked straight for yet another six. Gayle can't wait for after the match;
19.4;6;Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs low full toss, wide outside off, Pollard clears the front leg and hits it for a six over long-off. This is carnage. Call the ambulance. It's a car wreck, this over;
19.3;6;Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs that's a flat slog-sweep that doesn't seem to have much elevation on it, but it is enough to clear a leaping Hogg at deep midwicket who gets a hand on it;
19.2;1;Doherty to Gayle, 1 run full, on leg, misses out, takes one to short fine leg. He looks in pain when running;
19.1;6;Doherty to Gayle, SIX runs full toss first ball. Gayle stands tall and pulls this over midwicket for his 16th six of the tournament;
18.6;2;Starc to Pollard, 2 runs yorker, angling in from round the stumps, still place wide of long-on for two. Gayle will be on strike for the first ball of the last over;
18.5;4;Starc to Pollard, FOUR runs who'dathunk it? Pollard down on a knee, under the full ball, and guiding it over the keeper's head. Gayle is so impressed he practises that shot at the non-striker's end;
18.4;4;Starc to Pollard, FOUR runs full toss, into the pads, flicked away, Michael Hussey over-runs this at deep midwicket. That's a rare rare error from Hussey. That kind of night for Australia;
18.3;1;Starc to Gayle, 1 run nice again. Full, swinging in to him, can't get under it. The inside edge onto the pad yields just the one;
18.2;?;Starc to Gayle, no run yorker, swinging in, squeezes under his bat. Rare dot;
18.1;6;Starc to Gayle, SIX runs Length ball, into the pads, gone. Can't bowl length to him. Gayle has flicked this, merely flicked this, into the West Indies dugout around the midwicket area;
17.6;4;Cummins to Pollard, FOUR runs what do you do with these batsmen and these bats? It's almost a yorker, cramping him, but Pollard has flicked it so well he has bisected long-on and deep midwicket;
17.5;?;Cummins to Pollard, no run slower offcutter, turning down leg, lucky that Pollard has found short fine. Gayle not running any tight singles now;
17.4;1;Cummins to Gayle, 1 run Bailey has saved three here. This was smashed with some force to his left at extra cover, and he put a full-length dive in;
17.3;4;Cummins to Gayle, FOUR runs "You can tell he is gone now, he is hitting only fours." Classic commentary from David Lloyd. Gayle premeditated a front-foot movement, Cummins bowled short, and he still managed to pull it wide of deep midwicket;
17.3;1w;Cummins to Gayle, 1 wide called a wide. Cummins bowls the bouncer, Gayle ducks under it. Too high it is;
17.2;1;Cummins to Pollard, 1 run low full toss, can't get under it, hit to long-on. Gayle almost walks the single;

16.2;?;Watson to Gayle, no run slower ball, late-cuts it, finds short third man;
16.1;4;Watson to Gayle, FOUR runs thick inside edge. Four. No country for bowlers. Length ball, on leg, Gayle clears the front leg and swings. That beats the diving deep square;
13.6;1;Hogg to Bravo, 1 run down the wicket, Hogg bowls short, Bravo gets a single to long-off;
13.5;1;Hogg to Gayle, 1 run quicker lebreak, Gayle waits for it, and opens the face to take a single;
13.4;1;Hogg to Bravo, 1 run tries the big drive, never mind reading the spin, gets an edge to short third man;
13.3;?;Hogg to Bravo, no run Bravo is not picking them. Pushes tentatively to this full delivery, and defends it back;
13.2;?;Hogg to Bravo, no run full, turning in, beats him in the fight, gets a dot;
13.1;6;Hogg to Bravo, SIX runs wrong'un but too short, and Bravo goes right back into the crease to smack this for a flat six. Not too wide of deep midwicket, but you only have to miss them by a few feet if you hit so powerfully;
12.6;4;Watson to Gayle, FOUR runs No it isn't. It's short of a length, has pitched outside leg, and Gayle has glanced this fine of the diving short fine leg;
12.5;1;Watson to Bravo, 1 run driven straight of midwicket for a single;
12.4;6;Watson to Bravo, SIX runs and Bravo starts hitting sixes now. Length ball, middle and leg, and he moves forward to loft this over long-on: six sixes and three fours off the bat so far;

12.1;?;Watson to Bravo, no run length ball, angling into the pads, and he misses on that;
15.6;2;Cummins to Pollard, 2 runs full, middle and off, pushed into the on side with soft hands, and they have made a belated decision to take the second, but so huge are their strides they make it easily;
15.5;W;Cummins to Bravo, OUT good field placement. It's Bailey himself at straight extra cover and Bravo has hit this length ball straight to him. Some relief for Australia, but West Indies keep coming at you with their big hitters: Pollard, Russell and Sammy to follow;Dwayne Bravo c Bailey b Cummins 37 (37m 31b 1x4 3x6) SR: 119.35;
15.4;6;Cummins to Bravo, SIX runs this is unfair on the bowlers. Somebody has to regulate these bats. Slower ball, a clear mis-hit, it seems to have gone up into the orbit, but it clears long-off;
15.3;1;Cummins to Gayle, 1 run another slower ball, on a length, pitched outside leg, turning towards the stumps, worked away for a single;
15.2;?;Cummins to Gayle, no run well bowled, slower short one at 110ks, Gayle pulls out of the shot. Cummins gives him the stare too;
15.1;1;Cummins to Bravo, 1 run slow ball, short of a length, and punched away to deep cover;
14.6;4;Hussey to Gayle, FOUR runs what do you do Jack? You have bowled a yorker, you have not allowed Gayle to get under the ball, and he still squeezes it fine of short third man. Fifty for Gayle. The dugout is having a ball;
14.5;2lb;Hussey to Gayle, 2 leg byes;
14.4;2;Hussey to Gayle, 2 runs brave attempt by Starc He has taken it on the chin. Gayle goes across the line, mis-hits, deep midwicket is interested but it is not carrying. Starc, though, goes for the catch, falls well short, is hit on the chin, but shows no pain;
14.3;6;Hussey to Gayle, SIX runs quick, 104ks, and finally Hussey lets Gayle get under the ball. And where has it gone? Second tier. Over the straight boundary, which is the long boundary. Joint-biggest six of the tournament;
14.2;4;Hussey to Gayle, FOUR runs that was a good ball. Hussey again managed to not let him get under the ball. Full, straight, low, Gayle gets an inside edge, and it hurtles across, wide of long-on. How badly do you make Gayle to mis-hit to get him out or keep him down to one?;
14.1;1;Hussey to Bravo, 1 run full, on off, driven to deep cover for one;
11.6;1;Starc to Bravo, 1 run driven with an open face, gets a single to third man;

11.3;1;Starc to Gayle, 1 run full, swinging in, pushed to long-on for one;

11.2;5w;Starc to Gayle, 5 wide you can't swing it from there. Full, well down leg, five wides;
11.1;1;Starc to Bravo, 1 run full, angling in, driven to long-on;
10.6;1;Hussey to Bravo, 1 run driven down the ground for another single;
10.5;4b;Hussey to Bravo, 4 byes is that a difficult difficult drop?. No it's byes. A real toughie. A high full toss from Hussey, which Bravo misses, and it is really asking for too much for a keeper to collect it;
10.4;1;Hussey to Gayle, 1 run stays full, straight and low again. Not letting him get under it. Another single to long-on;
10.3;1;Hussey to Bravo, 1 run short, outside off, punched away for another single;
10.2;1;Hussey to Gayle, 1 run full, straight and quick, dug out for a single to deep midwicket;

9.6;1;Doherty to Bravo, 1 run full, on off, pushed towards long-on for one;

9.4;1;Doherty to Bravo, 1 run X man slows it down now, cut away for an easy single;
9.3;1;Doherty to Gayle, 1 run swept away for a single. Doherty will be relieved;
9.2;6;Doherty to Gayle, SIX runs full, on off, in his swinging arc, and it goes for a flat six over long-on. Not surprising. Caught well by a policeman in front of the sight screen;
9.1;?;Doherty to Gayle, no run short of a length, not in his swinging arc, and Gayle defends;
8.6;?;Hogg to Bravo, no run quicker delivery, and if not a googly it at least went on with the angle. Beats the Bravo cut;
8.5;?;Hogg to Bravo, no run flighted nicely, defended;
8.4;4;Hogg to Bravo, FOUR runs David Hussey's first touch in this tournament is a no-touch. And what a shot he has had to field first up. An inside-out loft from Bravo that bounces just short of him at long-off and then bursts through the hands;
8.3;?;Hogg to Bravo, no run it's a googly first up, Bravo stays back and pushes it to Watson at point;
8.2;1;Hogg to Gayle, 1 run nice delivery, pitches on leg, just short of driving length, turning sharply towards off, swept away softly;
8.1;?;Hogg to Gayle, no run full, really full, don't know which way it is turning because it is a yorker. Hit back to him;

7.4;1;Cummins to Gayle, 1 run slower ball, short of a length, punched square for a single;
7.3;1;Cummins to Bravo, 1 run full, outside off, stylishly driven to sweeper-cover;
7.2;W;Cummins to Samuels, OUT Timbahhh. Slower ball at 116ks, and the middle stump lays flat. Samuels plays the odd ungainly slog this time, and is comprehensively deceived by the slower one;Marlon Samuels b Cummins 26 (23m 20b 2x4 2x6) SR: 130;
7.1;4;Cummins to Samuels, FOUR runs no, he bowls full, and pays the price. Sameuls moves half-forward, makes room by opening the front leg a bit, and then smacks it over extra cover. Split seconds later, it hits the advertising boards;
6.6;1;Hogg to Samuels, 1 run they had Gayle where they wanted him, taking a tight single as Samuels dabbed it to backward point, but those strides are big enough to get him in in time;
6.5;?;Hogg to Samuels, no run wrong'un again. The line outside leg seems to be a giveaway, but he draws another defensive shot out of Samuels;
6.4;?;Hogg to Samuels, no run the legbreak now, but a bit too short. Samuels, though, finds point with the cut;
6.3;?;Hogg to Samuels, no run googly, Samuels seems to have picked it off the pitch, but has recovered well to defend;
6.2;?;Hogg to Samuels, no run a grubber. Samuels is beaten by the low bounce, Wade does well to collect it and attempt a stumping. When he played the cut, Samuels was outside the crease, but got the back foot back in time;
6.1;6;Hogg to Samuels, SIX runs never mind the bat's thickness. This one was played so well he could have hit a six with a ruler. Right down to the pitch of the ball, dead straight, and off the middle of the bat;
5.6;6;Doherty to Gayle, SIX runs this was on the cards, but to the first ball he aces from regulation left-arm spin? Doherty stays round the stumps to cut the angle, but he still lands it in Gayle's swinging zone, and Gayle sends it rows behind deep midwicket;
5.5;1;Doherty to Samuels, 1 run cut away in front of square;
5.4;6;Doherty to Samuels, SIX runs Samuels gets into the six-hitting act. Full, middle and leg, pretty similar to the leg-before delivery, but he has lofted it clean over long-on;
5.3;?;Doherty to Samuels, no run short, gets a bottom edge on the cut;
5.2;?;Doherty to Samuels, no run Samuels is lucky again. This was dead plumb. Umpire Dar has had a slip. This is full, pitches middle, straightens, and is missing both the leg and off stumps. Samuels has got away with one here;
5.1;?;Doherty to Samuels, no run and edge first up. Samuels is lucky it has not carries to slip as he opens the face;
4.6;6;Watson to Gayle, SIX runs Gayle 1, Watson 0. Deep deep into the stands. Length ball, outside off, Gayle goes straight now, and makes a sweet connection. And it sails over long-off;
4.5;1;Watson to Samuels, 1 run full and straight, pushed wide of mid-on for one;
4.4;1lb;Watson to Gayle, 1 leg bye appeal for leg-before, but this is short of a length, not swinging, and hitting middle and leg, so it has to be pitched outside leg;
4.3;?;Watson to Gayle, no run Watson slips in the bouncer, and Gayle ducks under it;
4.2;?;Watson to Gayle, no run Gayle swings and misses. Watson nearly gets his man. He clears the front leg and goes over cow corner, but all he connects is thin air;
4.1;1lb;Watson to Samuels, 1 leg bye length ball, into the pads, that was a freebie, but he concedes just the leg-bye;
3.6;?;Cummins to Gayle, no run short of a length, just outside off, punched to cover-point;
3.5;1;Cummins to Samuels, 1 run short, 148ks, hurries him into the pull, but the mis-hit lands safe and yields a single;
3.4;4;Cummins to Samuels, FOUR runs that's silken. End of edges for Samuels. Just stands tall and meets a length ball with a slightly open face, placing it wide of mid-off;
3.3;?;Cummins to Samuels, no run Samuels is dealing in edges at the moment. Drives at a wide length ball without getting close to it, and gets a bottom edge that's safe;
3.2;1;Cummins to Gayle, 1 run short of a length, pitching outside leg, angling towards leg, worked away for another single;
3.1;1;Cummins to Samuels, 1 run short of a length, angling in, dropped into the leg side for one;
2.6;1;Starc to Samuels, 1 run and he produces a thick inside edge right away, which goes for a single to fine leg;
2.5;W;Starc to Charles, OUT Charles is gone. Starc has struck. Perhaps this attack is too good for him. Starc has been swinging the ball back in, but this is short of a length, and goes with the angle. All Charles manages is an edge through to Wade;Johnson Charles c ?Wade b Starc 10 (14m 13b 2x4 0x6) SR: 76.92;
2.4;1;Starc to Gayle, 1 run thick edge again. Two moral victories for Starc. Gayle gets a second single to third man;
2.4;1w;Starc to Gayle, 1 wide dug in again, looking to tuck him up, but strays too far down leg;
2.3;?;Starc to Gayle, no run dug in short, 137ks, Gayle plays the defensive shot off the front foot;
2.2;1;Starc to Charles, 1 run full and wide, driven without getting close to it, gets a soft edge on it, which falls well short of slip, but White is superb at slip;
2.1;1;Starc to Gayle, 1 run full, swinging away as expected, gets a thick outside edge of the defensive bat for a single to third man;
1.6;4;Watson to Charles, FOUR runs that's a swipe. Good-old Twenty20 swipe. Clears the front leg, and goes right across the line, hoping for the best as he does so. And it goes uppishly, but wide of mid-on;
1.5;?;Watson to Charles, no run plays a tentative defensive shot now, gets an inside edge to a full delivery;
1.4;4;Watson to Charles, FOUR runs Charles opens up. First boundary of the second semi-final. Fullish, into the pads, he opens up front leg, and lofts this over midwicket. It meets the boundary cushions on a half-volley;
1.3;?;Watson to Charles, no run full, on off, pushed to mid-on;
1.2;1;Watson to Gayle, 1 run and the big man steals a quick single. Pushed straight to mid-off, who is sitting back because of the Gayle force, and they run a single;
1.1;1lb;Watson to Charles, 1 leg bye Charles moves well across to a full delivery, and lucky the ball is too straight, otherwise he would have been lbw;
0.6;1;Starc to Charles, 1 run full, middle and leg, driven wide of mid-on, takes the single. Gayle kept away from the strike for some more;
0.5;?;Starc to Charles, no run full, widish, driven square, to cover-point;
0.4;?;Starc to Charles, no run full and straight now, nearly a yorker, dug out to mid-on;
0.4;1w;Starc to Charles, 1 wide this one swings away. Really full, and starts wide too, and called wide;
0.3;?;Starc to Charles, no run nice, straighter and swinging in, Charles has to hurry lest he be called dead plumb;
0.2;?;Starc to Charles, no run fuller, nearly a half-volley, driven square to cover-point;
0.1;?;Starc to Charles, no run nice swing first up, 136ks, on a length well outside off, then shaping back in. Charles leaves it alone;
19.6;W;Doherty to Pollard, OUT oh finally a mis-hit finds a fielder. Pollard is looking for a fourth straight six, but this time he slices it high, high, high, and Warner takes a safe catch at long-off. Warner will have to do much more with the bat if we are going to have a match tonight;Kieron Pollard c Warner b Doherty 38 (22m 15b 3x4 3x6) SR: 253.33;

10.5;4b;Hussey to Bravo, 4 byes is that a difficult difficult drop?. No it's byes. A real toughie. A high full toss from Hussey, which Bravo misses, and it is really asking for too much for a keeper to collect it;
10.4;1;Hussey to Gayle, 1 run stays full, straight and low again. Not letting him get under it. Another single to long-on;
10.3;1;Hussey to Bravo, 1 run short, outside off, punched away for another single;
10.2;1;Hussey to Gayle, 1 run full, straight and quick, dug out for a single to deep midwicket;
10.1;1;Hussey to Bravo, 1 run short of a length, dabbed to short third man;
9.6;1;Doherty to Bravo, 1 run full, on off, pushed towards long-on for one;
9.5;1;Doherty to Gayle, 1 run shorter than Gayle expects it, Gayle sweeps, is beaten by the turn, but takes the leg-bye;
9.4;1;Doherty to Bravo, 1 run X man slows it down now, cut away for an easy single;
9.3;1;Doherty to Gayle, 1 run swept away for a single. Doherty will be relieved;
9.2;6;Doherty to Gayle, SIX runs full, on off, in his swinging arc, and it goes for a flat six over long-on. Not surprising. Caught well by a policeman in front of the sight screen;
9.1;?;Doherty to Gayle, no run short of a length, not in his swinging arc, and Gayle defends;
8.6;?;Hogg to Bravo, no run quicker delivery, and if not a googly it at least went on with the angle. Beats the Bravo cut;
8.5;?;Hogg to Bravo, no run flighted nicely, defended;
8.4;4;Hogg to Bravo, FOUR runs David Hussey's first touch in this tournament is a no-touch. And what a shot he has had to field first up. An inside-out loft from Bravo that bounces just short of him at long-off and then bursts through the hands;
8.3;?;Hogg to Bravo, no run it's a googly first up, Bravo stays back and pushes it to Watson at point;
8.2;1;Hogg to Gayle, 1 run nice delivery, pitches on leg, just short of driving length, turning sharply towards off, swept away softly;
8.1;?;Hogg to Gayle, no run full, really full, don't know which way it is turning because it is a yorker. Hit back to him;
7.6;?;Cummins to Bravo, no run another slower ball, defended off the front foot. Top over from Cummins;
7.5;?;Cummins to Bravo, no run full and straight, defended by Bravo;
7.4;1;Cummins to Gayle, 1 run slower ball, short of a length, punched square for a single;
7.3;1;Cummins to Bravo, 1 run full, outside off, stylishly driven to sweeper-cover;
7.2;W;Cummins to Samuels, OUT Timbahhh. Slower ball at 116ks, and the middle stump lays flat. Samuels plays the odd ungainly slog this time, and is comprehensively deceived by the slower one;Marlon Samuels b Cummins 26 (23m 20b 2x4 2x6) SR: 130;
7.1;4;Cummins to Samuels, FOUR runs no, he bowls full, and pays the price. Sameuls moves half-forward, makes room by opening the front leg a bit, and then smacks it over extra cover. Split seconds later, it hits the advertising boards;
6.6;1;Hogg to Samuels, 1 run they had Gayle where they wanted him, taking a tight single as Samuels dabbed it to backward point, but those strides are big enough to get him in in time;
6.5;?;Hogg to Samuels, no run wrong'un again. The line outside leg seems to be a giveaway, but he draws another defensive shot out of Samuels;
6.4;?;Hogg to Samuels, no run the legbreak now, but a bit too short. Samuels, though, finds point with the cut;
6.3;?;Hogg to Samuels, no run googly, Samuels seems to have picked it off the pitch, but has recovered well to defend;
6.2;?;Hogg to Samuels, no run a grubber. Samuels is beaten by the low bounce, Wade does well to collect it and attempt a stumping. When he played the cut, Samuels was outside the crease, but got the back foot back in time;
6.1;6;Hogg to Samuels, SIX runs never mind the bat's thickness. This one was played so well he could have hit a six with a ruler. Right down to the pitch of the ball, dead straight, and off the middle of the bat;
5.6;6;Doherty to Gayle, SIX runs this was on the cards, but to the first ball he aces from regulation left-arm spin? Doherty stays round the stumps to cut the angle, but he still lands it in Gayle's swinging zone, and Gayle sends it rows behind deep midwicket;
5.5;1;Doherty to Samuels, 1 run cut away in front of square;
5.4;6;Doherty to Samuels, SIX runs Samuels gets into the six-hitting act. Full, middle and leg, pretty similar to the leg-before delivery, but he has lofted it clean over long-on;
5.3;?;Doherty to Samuels, no run short, gets a bottom edge on the cut;
5.2;?;Doherty to Samuels, no run Samuels is lucky again. This was dead plumb. Umpire Dar has had a slip. This is full, pitches middle, straightens, and is missing both the leg and off stumps. Samuels has got away with one here;
5.1;?;Doherty to Samuels, no run and edge first up. Samuels is lucky it has not carries to slip as he opens the face;
4.6;6;Watson to Gayle, SIX runs Gayle 1, Watson 0. Deep deep into the stands. Length ball, outside off, Gayle goes straight now, and makes a sweet connection. And it sails over long-off;
4.5;1;Watson to Samuels, 1 run full and straight, pushed wide of mid-on for one;
4.4;1lb;Watson to Gayle, 1 leg bye appeal for leg-before, but this is short of a length, not swinging, and hitting middle and leg, so it has to be pitched outside leg;
4.3;?;Watson to Gayle, no run Watson slips in the bouncer, and Gayle ducks under it;
4.2;?;Watson to Gayle, no run Gayle swings and misses. Watson nearly gets his man. He clears the front leg and goes over cow corner, but all he connects is thin air;
4.1;1lb;Watson to Samuels, 1 leg bye length ball, into the pads, that was a freebie, but he concedes just the leg-bye;
3.6;?;Cummins to Gayle, no run short of a length, just outside off, punched to cover-point;
3.5;1;Cummins to Samuels, 1 run short, 148ks, hurries him into the pull, but the mis-hit lands safe and yields a single;
3.4;4;Cummins to Samuels, FOUR runs that's silken. End of edges for Samuels. Just stands tall and meets a length ball with a slightly open face, placing it wide of mid-off;
3.3;?;Cummins to Samuels, no run Samuels is dealing in edges at the moment. Drives at a wide length ball without getting close to it, and gets a bottom edge that's safe;
3.2;1;Cummins to Gayle, 1 run short of a length, pitching outside leg, angling towards leg, worked away for another single;
3.1;1;Cummins to Samuels, 1 run short of a length, angling in, dropped into the leg side for one;
2.6;1;Starc to Samuels, 1 run and he produces a thick inside edge right away, which goes for a single to fine leg;
2.5;W;Starc to Charles, OUT Charles is gone. Starc has struck. Perhaps this attack is too good for him. Starc has been swinging the ball back in, but this is short of a length, and goes with the angle. All Charles manages is an edge through to Wade;Johnson Charles c ?Wade b Starc 10 (14m 13b 2x4 0x6) SR: 76.92;
2.4;1;Starc to Gayle, 1 run thick edge again. Two moral victories for Starc. Gayle gets a second single to third man;
2.4;1w;Starc to Gayle, 1 wide dug in again, looking to tuck him up, but strays too far down leg;
2.3;?;Starc to Gayle, no run dug in short, 137ks, Gayle plays the defensive shot off the front foot;
2.2;1;Starc to Charles, 1 run full and wide, driven without getting close to it, gets a soft edge on it, which falls well short of slip, but White is superb at slip;
2.1;1;Starc to Gayle, 1 run full, swinging away as expected, gets a thick outside edge of the defensive bat for a single to third man;
1.6;4;Watson to Charles, FOUR runs that's a swipe. Good-old Twenty20 swipe. Clears the front leg, and goes right across the line, hoping for the best as he does so. And it goes uppishly, but wide of mid-on;
1.5;?;Watson to Charles, no run plays a tentative defensive shot now, gets an inside edge to a full delivery;
1.4;4;Watson to Charles, FOUR runs Charles opens up. First boundary of the second semi-final. Fullish, into the pads, he opens up front leg, and lofts this over midwicket. It meets the boundary cushions on a half-volley;
1.3;?;Watson to Charles, no run full, on off, pushed to mid-on;
1.2;1;Watson to Gayle, 1 run and the big man steals a quick single. Pushed straight to mid-off, who is sitting back because of the Gayle force, and they run a single;
1.1;1lb;Watson to Charles, 1 leg bye Charles moves well across to a full delivery, and lucky the ball is too straight, otherwise he would have been lbw;
0.6;1;Starc to Charles, 1 run full, middle and leg, driven wide of mid-on, takes the single. Gayle kept away from the strike for some more;
0.5;?;Starc to Charles, no run full, widish, driven square, to cover-point;
0.4;?;Starc to Charles, no run full and straight now, nearly a yorker, dug out to mid-on;
0.4;1w;Starc to Charles, 1 wide this one swings away. Really full, and starts wide too, and called wide;
0.3;?;Starc to Charles, no run nice, straighter and swinging in, Charles has to hurry lest he be called dead plumb;
0.2;?;Starc to Charles, no run fuller, nearly a half-volley, driven square to cover-point;
0.1;?;Starc to Charles, no run nice swing first up, 136ks, on a length well outside off, then shaping back in. Charles leaves it alone;

6pm "Australia can't play spin," sumps up pundit Kevin Pietersen. "Neither can the West Indies." That is why Pietersen is not calling any favourites in this match. Nor are we. Welcome to part two of Australia v West Indies on the semi-final night. The toss is in 30 minutes
The pitch is now a matter of big debate. Pietersen, and many others, don't like that it is helping spinners so much. The argument from that side is that such turners lead to unpredictability, and one-sided matches. They say Twenty20 was not meant to be this. Twenty20 was meant to produce close matches, and was a batsman's game. Sambit Bal makes a fair point here when he says that crumbling wickets play tricks with players' minds that are best left out of Twenty20 cricket.
Me, I grant you all that, but I prefer T20 on pitches that test the batsmen. On normal flat tracks the bowler is completely out of the game. He might get wickets, but that's often because the batsman has played a bad shot that is hard to explain. Here the batsmen is made to work hard. And I will any day take Mahela Jayawardene's 42 the other night over Richard Levi's 117

6.05pm Ian Chappell thinks the pitch for tonight will hold much better than it did last night. He says it will still help spinners and quicks who bowl cutters, but the batsmen will enjoy it much more than they did last night. There are still a couple of patches on the pitch that are a bit powdery

6.15 It is unpredictable all right, but there is no harm predicting which team will win this match. Because if you that accurately, you stand to win a beach cricket set and shirt from Gray Nicolls. And, if you're in the UK, enter our special comp to win your own custom bat and watch it being made in the factory

6.20pm We are pretty close to the toss now. David Hussey is the name almost every Australian fan wants to see in that XI. I presume they will retain Xavier Doherty ahead of Daniel Christian. So there's only three men D Hussey can replace: Glenn Maxwell, Cameron white and George Bailey. Let me be mildly controversial by saying these two happen to be teams with captains who will struggle to find a place in the XI if they were not captains, which is not to say I am undermining their contribution as leaders.
On a more practical note then, if D Hussey is to play, either Maxwell or white will have to sit out. Australia don't like to change their combination so deep into a competition, so it will be interesting to see what they do.
For West Indies, Dwayne Bravo - pending fitness - should replace Darren Bravo. It will be a toss-up between D Smith and Johnson Charles, but Charles is the favourite between the two. I really do hope they play four specialist bowlers, but they have only four in the squad, and one of them - Fidel Edwards - is having an ordinary tournament. So you'll have three specialists plus Sammy and friends

6.40pm As we approach the anthems, let me repeat what I said just before the previous match. What's with the national-anthemisation of Rally Round The West Indies at the grounds? The original is such a nice Calypso, the one being rendered at the grounds is boring and dull and too much of a national anthem, when the West Indies cricket doesn't have a national anthem but a cricket anthem. Listen to the real one here before they assault it at the Premadasa Satdium
"I think you'll find most Australian fans are happy with Maxwell, it's guys like Cameron White who are underperforming." Andrew, I meant the Aussies have been wanting D Hussey in, not necessarily in Maxwell's place
Out come Darren Sammy and George Bailey along with Ranjan Madugalle, the match referee. Bailey spins the coin, Sammy calls heads and heads it is. So Sammy has won the toss and West Indies are batting first. Sammy says this pitch looks like a Trinidad wicket. Just the one expected change for West Indies: Dwayne Bravo in for his brother. He is not fit enough to bowl, though. One change for Australia too, and one their fans have been clamouring for. David Hussey replaces Glenn Maxwell

6.55pmThe Australia ladies, already in the finals after the win earlier in the day, are there to cheer the men. Both the teams are out for the anthems. Rally Round The West Indies first, and then Advance Australia Fair
"I think these two teams are the only teams that have had specialist keeper and specialist captain.The rest of the side is pretty impressive.Why not have a world class player as a captain?" Mahip, just for people like you and I, Sammy is going to take a four-for today and Bailey will score a 25-ball 50

Chris Gayle and Johnson Charles walk out to open. Gayle has one left-arm quick and two left-arm spinners lined up. Mitch Starc will bowl the first over. Charles is on strike. Two slips in...
 Innings Start
So now we know, 12 teams whittled down to two and it will be Sri Lanka v West Indies in the final on Sunday, 7pm IST, once again in Colombo. And shortly beforehand the Women's final takes place between England and Australia, 2.30pm start for that one. We'll be here as per usual bringing you all the best coverage, reaction and analysis. So make sure you join us then. From Sid Monga and myself, Alex Winter, see you Sunday...

So to the Presentation and George Bailey: "We were absolutely outplayed," he says. "Gayle was subdued for a while but while he's at the crease he's always in your mind. But we set ourselves to get to the semi-finals and I don't think there's one area specifically where we can improve on. But from tonight you can probably say all three!"

"We did what we had to do, everybody turned up. Chris and Marlon set it up for us and then the bowling turned up too," he says with a smile. "If you look at the quality in the dressing room, if we go out on the field and execute we can beat any team." Man of the Match for his 75 from 41 balls is Chris Gayle, the big man came good today for his side, can he do it in the big one on Sunday...

Start the Gangnam Style, West Indies have won by 74 runs and qualify for the World T20 final against Sri Lanka on Sunday. Congratulations to all in the Caribbean, their first final since 2006 Champions Trophy. They have been totally dominant today. Their big hitters fired with the bat, Chris Gayle in particular, as they posted a wonderfully entertaining score of over 200, the highest total in this year's competition. Australia also needed their big bashers to come off but Warner and Watson were removed in a hurry and the rest fell away but for a fine counterattack from George Bailey though the captain's knock was in vain.

16.4;W;Rampaul to Starc, OUT swing and miss, bowled him and it's all over. A length ball, clips the off bail, perfect delivery to end the game, aimed for the leg side and was a long way off;Mitchell Starc b Rampaul 2 (17m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40;
16.3;3;Rampaul to Doherty, 3 runs goes to play to leg, comes off the pad into the gully, slip fields again, and again the silly throw gives away an overthrow, in fact two of them;

16.1;1;Rampaul to Starc, 1 run full just outside off, slapped down to long on;

15.4;2;Narine to Doherty, 2 runs cut into the covers where there's a misfield so they take two;

15.2;?;Narine to Doherty, no run back to a wrong'un, defends it on the crease;
15.1;W;Narine to Hogg, OUT goes down the wicket, misses with a cut, the keeper whips off the bails, did Hogg get back? No he did not, sharp work from the keeper, had the bails off in a flash and Hogg didn't get back in time;Brad Hogg st ?Ramdin b Narine 7 (8m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
14.6;1;Rampaul to Hogg, 1 run full on leg stump, flicked down to long on;
14.5;2;Rampaul to Hogg, 2 runs dabbed into the gully from outside off, slip goes across to field, a stupid throw at the non-striker's end brings two;
14.5;1w;Rampaul to Hogg, 1 wide back of a length down the leg side;
14.4;2;Rampaul to Hogg, 2 runs leg stump, turned into midwicket, two as the deep midwicket has to come a long way in;

13.4;?;Pollard to Starc, no run full and well wide, missed on the drive;
13.3;W;Pollard to Cummins, OUT first ball, steps away, goes to slap it miles but gets it straight up in the air and it's taken at extra cover. Can't blame Cummins for trying but didn't get this at all after giving himself room, straight up of a big top edge and extra cover took it simply on the edge of the circle;Pat Cummins c Charles b Pollard 13 (28m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 86.66;
13.2;W;Pollard to Bailey, OUT another step to leg and goes for the leg side fence taking on the deep fielder but this time picks him out. That's a very brave effort from Bailey but this time he doesn't quite time it and the man on the rope doesn't have to move to take the catch;George Bailey c Russell b Pollard 63 (41m 29b 6x4 4x6) SR: 217.24;
13.1;4;Pollard to Bailey, FOUR runs step to leg, goes to swing down the ground, gets a top edge over the keeper, four to the backstop;

12.2;1;Sammy to Cummins, 1 run nice shot, timed down the ground for a quick single;
12.1;1;Sammy to Bailey, 1 run length on middle and leg, Bailey is down to paddle it and doesn't quite get it past the deep fielder;

11.5;2;Narine to Cummins, 2 runs nicely played, dropped past slip from a length outside off, well played;
11.4;2lb;Narine to Cummins, 2 leg byes too straight this, comes off the pad down the leg side, a couple with hard running;

10.6;4;Russell to Cummins, FOUR runs full and too full, flicked away fine, no long leg, that's four more;
10.5;1;Russell to Bailey, 1 run short this time, that's well timed too, only a single though, finds the fielder at deep square, that should have gone again;
10.4;6;Russell to Bailey, SIX runs smash! Gone again, clear the front leg and wallop it into the stands, timed superbly again, three out of four timed to perfection this over;
10.3;4;Russell to Bailey, FOUR runs goes again, gets it off the toe though and this should be easily caught but no! The fielder slips and lets it through his hands for four! Whoops;
10.2;4;Russell to Bailey, FOUR runs and again, this time wide of long off and one bounce for four, timed again, very nice;
10.1;6;Russell to Bailey, SIX runs another lovely strike from the skipper...where has this boy been...smashed a full ball just outside off over long off, lovely timing;
9.6;1;Badree to Bailey, 1 run quicker ball, back of a length, clipped to long on;
9.5;2;Badree to Bailey, 2 runs shorter outside off, slapped down to long off where there's a fumble and they can get back for two;

9.3;1;Badree to Cummins, 1 run full on the leg stump, strikes the pad, runs into the covers, was going down;
9.2;?;Badree to Cummins, no run outside off, skids on and Cummins misses with a back foot drive aimed at extra cover;

8.6;?;Rampaul to Cummins, no run banged in again, cut at and missed outside off;

7.3;4;Narine to Bailey, FOUR runs Bailey has a swing here, pulling and gets it past square leg to the rope, powerfully struck;
7.2;W;Narine to Wade, OUT swept at and a top edge to short long leg. He had trouble against Narine in the Windies did Wade and he's lasted two balls here. Goes to sweep just outside leg stump and gets a top edge that flies straight to the fielder on the 45, simple catch;Matthew Wade c Badree b Narine 1 (4m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
7.1;?;Narine to Wade, no run forward on off stump, played towards cover;

6.4;?;Rampaul to Wade, no run bumper again, too high this time;
6.3;W;Rampaul to Hussey, OUT short ball into the body, the batsman gets into a total tangle and chips a catch back to the bowler. A disgusting dismissal. Got into a complete mess trying to defend it back to the bowler or turn it to leg, in the end, stood squared up and turned the face, it looped off a leading edge providing a simple chance to Rampaul who ran forward three yards to take it;David Hussey c & b Rampaul 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
6.2;?;Rampaul to Hussey, no run bumper, well directed, a goodun, swing and a miss;
6.1;W;Rampaul to White, OUT full and sliding now leg, Ramdin takes it and goes up for a huge appeal and up goes the finger! Rampaul strikes first ball with a strangle down the leg side, complete luck that is, White went to flick it to leg and must have got a thin touch on it, Ramdin was convinced and so was the umpire;Cameron White c ?Ramdin b Rampaul 5 (12m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33;
5.6;4;Samuels to Bailey, FOUR runs four more down the ground, stepping back and slapping it past the bowler, a straight pull almost past mid off, another excellent strike;
5.5;4;Samuels to Bailey, FOUR runs tossed up outside off, slugged down the ground and over mid off, good strike;
5.4;?;Samuels to Bailey, no run goes to late cut again but it turns in from outside off, cramps him up and he keeps it out on the crease;
5.3;?;Samuels to Bailey, no run forward this time playing towards point, no run;
5.2;1;Samuels to White, 1 run waited for and late cut into the covers;
5.1;2;Samuels to White, 2 runs played from off stump towards long on, good running produces the error from the fielder and they take two;
4.6;2;Badree to Bailey, 2 runs back and played into the leg side for a single past point;
4.5;?;Badree to Bailey, no run forward and blocking into the leg side;
4.4;?;Badree to Bailey, no run first ball tries to pull, it's nowhere near short enough to pull and goes under the stroke and thankfully for the batsman past off stump;
4.3;W;Badree to Watson, OUT goes for the shame stroke, again it skips on but this is straight and out goes leg stump. Right call to keep Badree going because he's slid one past the big man. That is a massive, massive blow. It was dragged down but skidded on to Watson and he was too late with the stroke;Shane Watson b Badree 7 (19m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 77.77;
4.2;?;Badree to Watson, no run steps back quickly to pull hard but misses, skipped on a touched quicker;
4.1;1;Badree to White, 1 run leg stump and full, played into the on side for just a single;
3.6;4;Samuels to Watson, FOUR runs step back to cut and slaps it past extra cover, super timing, it was just fractionally short and Watson was on to it in a flash;
3.5;?;Samuels to Watson, no run outside off, goes to sweep and misses completely, god job it was wide;
3.4;1;Samuels to White, 1 run dropped into midwicket off a length;
3.3;?;Samuels to White, no run awkward push forward on off stump, gets it off an outside edge into the off side, tentative;
3.2;1;Samuels to Watson, 1 run bit of turn here, played off the hip towards short long leg from a length;
3.1;W;Samuels to Hussey, OUT oh swept straight up in the air and taken by the bowler in typically nonplussed fashion. Kicks the ball away, is that how one celebrates getting rid of Hussey in a semi-final? It is if you're Marlon Samuels. It was just outside off and Hussey swung hard at it aiming over the leg side but got it off a huge top edge and it went nowhere;Michael Hussey c & b Samuels 18 (8m 12b 3x4 0x6) SR: 150;
2.6;1;Badree to Hussey, 1 run driven hard again, well timed again, mid off just gets round and saves four;
2.5;2;Badree to Hussey, 2 runs leg stump again, flicked into the on-side, two as midwicket has to chase round quite a distance;
2.4;?;Badree to Hussey, no run pushed into the off side again, only finds extra cover;
2.3;?;Badree to Hussey, no run outside off, driven again, this time only finds cover point;
2.2;4;Badree to Hussey, FOUR runs four more, behind square on the leg side this time, full on leg stump and flicked away using the pace, nicely played;
2.1;4;Badree to Hussey, FOUR runs quite flat outside off, chopped away behind square on the off side, this is timed well and away for four;
1.6;3;Samuels to Hussey, 3 runs this time gets the square drive away, past point, not timed well enough to get four;
1.5;?;Samuels to Hussey, no run skips through quicker and beats Hussey's push forward, close to off stump again;
1.4;?;Samuels to Hussey, no run goes to square drive outside off and gets a bottom edge into the turf;
1.3;4;Samuels to Hussey, FOUR runs lifted up and over mid off, nice stroke that from a full length on off stump, struck well;
1.2;?;Samuels to Hussey, no run back of a length again, this time cut to backward point;
1.2;1w;Samuels to Hussey, 1 wide fired wide of off stump, left alone;
1.1;1;Samuels to Watson, 1 run swept hard from outside off, fielded well by deep midwicket running round, collects on the second bounce;
0.6;W;Badree to Warner, OUT back and it skips past the cut stroke and narrowly avoids off stump, Ramdin had the bails off and they're going the check for the stumping, surely Warner didn't leave his ground here...oh it's not for the stumping it's bowled him! Who would have thought that, it nicked the off stump on the way through to the keeper and has bowled Warner. What a blow for West Indies, another great start from Badree;David Warner b Badree 1 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
0.5;1;Badree to Watson, 1 run back once more, cut hard but Charles dives a cover point and saves four, fine save, good work;

0.1;?;Badree to Warner, no run tossed up outside off, firm punch to mid off;
16.4;W;Rampaul to Starc, OUT swing and miss, bowled him and it's all over. A length ball, clips the off bail, perfect delivery to end the game, aimed for the leg side and was a long way off;Mitchell Starc b Rampaul 2 (17m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40;
16.3;3;Rampaul to Doherty, 3 runs goes to play to leg, comes off the pad into the gully, slip fields again, and again the silly throw gives away an overthrow, in fact two of them;
16.2;?;Rampaul to Doherty, no run bumper, good line, ducked under;
16.1;1;Rampaul to Starc, 1 run full just outside off, slapped down to long on;
15.6;4;Narine to Doherty, FOUR runs floated up and lifted over mid off, fine strike this is, timed really well, gave himself room and struck through the line;
15.5;?;Narine to Doherty, no run goes for the reverse sweep again, this time off the stumps, misses again and the turn takes it past off stump;
15.4;2;Narine to Doherty, 2 runs cut into the covers where there's a misfield so they take two;
15.3;?;Narine to Doherty, no run goes for a reverse sweep from outside leg stump, struck on the pad;
15.2;?;Narine to Doherty, no run back to a wrong'un, defends it on the crease;
15.1;W;Narine to Hogg, OUT goes down the wicket, misses with a cut, the keeper whips off the bails, did Hogg get back? No he did not, sharp work from the keeper, had the bails off in a flash and Hogg didn't get back in time;Brad Hogg st ?Ramdin b Narine 7 (8m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
14.6;1;Rampaul to Hogg, 1 run full on leg stump, flicked down to long on;
14.5;2;Rampaul to Hogg, 2 runs dabbed into the gully from outside off, slip goes across to field, a stupid throw at the non-striker's end brings two;
14.5;1w;Rampaul to Hogg, 1 wide back of a length down the leg side;
14.4;2;Rampaul to Hogg, 2 runs leg stump, turned into midwicket, two as the deep midwicket has to come a long way in;
14.3;?;Rampaul to Hogg, no run bumper, Hogg steps away, bowler follows him and ducks and falls over;
14.2;1lb;Rampaul to Starc, 1 leg bye length ball, strikes the pad, they go for the run as the ball runs back up the wicket;
14.1;1;Rampaul to Hogg, 1 run length outside off, angled down to third man;
13.6;1;Pollard to Hogg, 1 run around the wicket, angled in, played half-forward and gets an inside edge from off stump down to long leg;
13.5;1;Pollard to Starc, 1 run back of a length and pulled to deep square leg, well struck but finds the man;
13.4;?;Pollard to Starc, no run full and well wide, missed on the drive;
13.3;W;Pollard to Cummins, OUT first ball, steps away, goes to slap it miles but gets it straight up in the air and it's taken at extra cover. Can't blame Cummins for trying but didn't get this at all after giving himself room, straight up of a big top edge and extra cover took it simply on the edge of the circle;Pat Cummins c Charles b Pollard 13 (28m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 86.66;
13.2;W;Pollard to Bailey, OUT another step to leg and goes for the leg side fence taking on the deep fielder but this time picks him out. That's a very brave effort from Bailey but this time he doesn't quite time it and the man on the rope doesn't have to move to take the catch;George Bailey c Russell b Pollard 63 (41m 29b 6x4 4x6) SR: 217.24;
13.1;4;Pollard to Bailey, FOUR runs step to leg, goes to swing down the ground, gets a top edge over the keeper, four to the backstop;

12.2;1;Sammy to Cummins, 1 run nice shot, timed down the ground for a quick single;
12.1;1;Sammy to Bailey, 1 run length on middle and leg, Bailey is down to paddle it and doesn't quite get it past the deep fielder;

11.5;2;Narine to Cummins, 2 runs nicely played, dropped past slip from a length outside off, well played;
11.4;2lb;Narine to Cummins, 2 leg byes too straight this, comes off the pad down the leg side, a couple with hard running;

11.1;1;Narine to Bailey, 1 run outside off, goes across his stumps and works it into midwicket;
10.6;4;Russell to Cummins, FOUR runs full and too full, flicked away fine, no long leg, that's four more;
10.5;1;Russell to Bailey, 1 run short this time, that's well timed too, only a single though, finds the fielder at deep square, that should have gone again;
10.4;6;Russell to Bailey, SIX runs smash! Gone again, clear the front leg and wallop it into the stands, timed superbly again, three out of four timed to perfection this over;
10.3;4;Russell to Bailey, FOUR runs goes again, gets it off the toe though and this should be easily caught but no! The fielder slips and lets it through his hands for four! Whoops;
10.2;4;Russell to Bailey, FOUR runs and again, this time wide of long off and one bounce for four, timed again, very nice;
10.1;6;Russell to Bailey, SIX runs another lovely strike from the skipper...where has this boy been...smashed a full ball just outside off over long off, lovely timing;
9.6;1;Badree to Bailey, 1 run quicker ball, back of a length, clipped to long on;
9.5;2;Badree to Bailey, 2 runs shorter outside off, slapped down to long off where there's a fumble and they can get back for two;
9.4;6;Badree to Bailey, SIX runs ah lovely, go on the skipper...slog swept over midwicket, picked up fabulously into the terraces;
9.3;1;Badree to Cummins, 1 run full on the leg stump, strikes the pad, runs into the covers, was going down;
9.2;?;Badree to Cummins, no run outside off, skids on and Cummins misses with a back foot drive aimed at extra cover;
9.1;1;Badree to Bailey, 1 run outside off, pushed towards cover point;
8.6;?;Rampaul to Cummins, no run banged in again, cut at and missed outside off;
8.5;?;Rampaul to Cummins, no run banged in, played very awkwardly, nearly like David Hussey chips a catch back to the bowler, came of a leading edge;

7.4;?;Narine to Bailey, no run forward on off stump, played back towards the bowler;
7.3;4;Narine to Bailey, FOUR runs Bailey has a swing here, pulling and gets it past square leg to the rope, powerfully struck;
7.2;W;Narine to Wade, OUT swept at and a top edge to short long leg. He had trouble against Narine in the Windies did Wade and he's lasted two balls here. Goes to sweep just outside leg stump and gets a top edge that flies straight to the fielder on the 45, simple catch;Matthew Wade c Badree b Narine 1 (4m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
7.1;?;Narine to Wade, no run forward on off stump, played towards cover;

6.5;?;Rampaul to Wade, no run back of a length outside off, punched to cover point;
6.4;?;Rampaul to Wade, no run bumper again, too high this time;
6.3;W;Rampaul to Hussey, OUT short ball into the body, the batsman gets into a total tangle and chips a catch back to the bowler. A disgusting dismissal. Got into a complete mess trying to defend it back to the bowler or turn it to leg, in the end, stood squared up and turned the face, it looped off a leading edge providing a simple chance to Rampaul who ran forward three yards to take it;David Hussey c & b Rampaul 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
6.2;?;Rampaul to Hussey, no run bumper, well directed, a goodun, swing and a miss;
6.1;W;Rampaul to White, OUT full and sliding now leg, Ramdin takes it and goes up for a huge appeal and up goes the finger! Rampaul strikes first ball with a strangle down the leg side, complete luck that is, White went to flick it to leg and must have got a thin touch on it, Ramdin was convinced and so was the umpire;Cameron White c ?Ramdin b Rampaul 5 (12m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33;
5.6;4;Samuels to Bailey, FOUR runs four more down the ground, stepping back and slapping it past the bowler, a straight pull almost past mid off, another excellent strike;
5.5;4;Samuels to Bailey, FOUR runs tossed up outside off, slugged down the ground and over mid off, good strike;
5.4;?;Samuels to Bailey, no run goes to late cut again but it turns in from outside off, cramps him up and he keeps it out on the crease;
5.3;?;Samuels to Bailey, no run forward this time playing towards point, no run;
5.2;1;Samuels to White, 1 run waited for and late cut into the covers;
5.1;2;Samuels to White, 2 runs played from off stump towards long on, good running produces the error from the fielder and they take two;
4.6;2;Badree to Bailey, 2 runs back and played into the leg side for a single past point;
4.5;?;Badree to Bailey, no run forward and blocking into the leg side;
4.4;?;Badree to Bailey, no run first ball tries to pull, it's nowhere near short enough to pull and goes under the stroke and thankfully for the batsman past off stump;
4.3;W;Badree to Watson, OUT goes for the shame stroke, again it skips on but this is straight and out goes leg stump. Right call to keep Badree going because he's slid one past the big man. That is a massive, massive blow. It was dragged down but skidded on to Watson and he was too late with the stroke;Shane Watson b Badree 7 (19m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 77.77;
4.2;?;Badree to Watson, no run steps back quickly to pull hard but misses, skipped on a touched quicker;
4.1;1;Badree to White, 1 run leg stump and full, played into the on side for just a single;
3.6;4;Samuels to Watson, FOUR runs step back to cut and slaps it past extra cover, super timing, it was just fractionally short and Watson was on to it in a flash;

3.4;1;Samuels to White, 1 run dropped into midwicket off a length;
3.3;?;Samuels to White, no run awkward push forward on off stump, gets it off an outside edge into the off side, tentative;
3.2;1;Samuels to Watson, 1 run bit of turn here, played off the hip towards short long leg from a length;
3.1;W;Samuels to Hussey, OUT oh swept straight up in the air and taken by the bowler in typically nonplussed fashion. Kicks the ball away, is that how one celebrates getting rid of Hussey in a semi-final? It is if you're Marlon Samuels. It was just outside off and Hussey swung hard at it aiming over the leg side but got it off a huge top edge and it went nowhere;Michael Hussey c & b Samuels 18 (8m 12b 3x4 0x6) SR: 150;
2.6;1;Badree to Hussey, 1 run driven hard again, well timed again, mid off just gets round and saves four;
2.5;2;Badree to Hussey, 2 runs leg stump again, flicked into the on-side, two as midwicket has to chase round quite a distance;
2.4;?;Badree to Hussey, no run pushed into the off side again, only finds extra cover;
2.3;?;Badree to Hussey, no run outside off, driven again, this time only finds cover point;
2.2;4;Badree to Hussey, FOUR runs four more, behind square on the leg side this time, full on leg stump and flicked away using the pace, nicely played;
2.1;4;Badree to Hussey, FOUR runs quite flat outside off, chopped away behind square on the off side, this is timed well and away for four;
1.6;3;Samuels to Hussey, 3 runs this time gets the square drive away, past point, not timed well enough to get four;

1.4;?;Samuels to Hussey, no run goes to square drive outside off and gets a bottom edge into the turf;
1.3;4;Samuels to Hussey, FOUR runs lifted up and over mid off, nice stroke that from a full length on off stump, struck well;
1.2;?;Samuels to Hussey, no run back of a length again, this time cut to backward point;
1.2;1w;Samuels to Hussey, 1 wide fired wide of off stump, left alone;
1.1;1;Samuels to Watson, 1 run swept hard from outside off, fielded well by deep midwicket running round, collects on the second bounce;
0.6;W;Badree to Warner, OUT back and it skips past the cut stroke and narrowly avoids off stump, Ramdin had the bails off and they're going the check for the stumping, surely Warner didn't leave his ground here...oh it's not for the stumping it's bowled him! Who would have thought that, it nicked the off stump on the way through to the keeper and has bowled Warner. What a blow for West Indies, another great start from Badree;David Warner b Badree 1 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;

0.2;1;Badree to Warner, 1 run dragged down, mistimed pull to square leg, missed out really;
0.1;?;Badree to Warner, no run tossed up outside off, firm punch to mid off;

Warner and Watson simply have to go big for Australia to have a chance here...but already there's some chat between Warner and Marlon Samuels, looked quite heated that; that shall add to the atmosphere here as Samuel Badree prepares to open the bowling...

Well that's more like it! Hello everyone, Alex Winter here, hope you enjoyed some proper T20 action there, I bloody loved it. T20 is not about subtly or careful accumulation, nor nurdling or nudging. It is about whacking the thing miles and that's just what the Windies have given us, true Gangam Style if you like! And hopefully we get a bit more in the second half, what a game it would be if the Wallabies chased these down...
