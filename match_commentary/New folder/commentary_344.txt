Data
11.10am 238 is what England have managed here without scoring a run today. Australia will be happy with that after Anderson and Bresnan teased them with their 24-run partnership yesterday. Australia's openers should be walking out in a few minutes. Any guesses on who they will be?
91.6;W;Bird to Anderson, OUT it's all over! England have been wrapped up for 238. This one pitched on middle and Anderson slashed hard at it, but the late movement got him and the ball crashed into the middle stump. Excellent variation form Bird. Started with outswing, threw in a bouncer and got the wicket with one that came back in;James Anderson b Bird 16 (22m 16b 4x4 0x6) SR: 100;
91.5;?;Bird to Anderson, no run good length again outside off, Anderson drives without much footwork and can't connect;
91.4;?;Bird to Anderson, no run that's got him on the helmet! It wasn't that short on the off stump but Anderson ducked, taking his eyes off the ball, and it hit him near the logo on his helmet. He's asking for a new one now, bit of a delay because of that;

91.2;?;Bird to Anderson, no run full and towards the pads, Anderson fails to connect;

90.6;?;Siddle to Bresnan, no run length ball outside off with a bit of extra bounce, Bresnan leaves it alone;
90.5;?;Siddle to Bresnan, no run slightly short outside off, Bresnan swings his arms and Khawaja does well to stop it at cover;

64.2;?;Harris to Bairstow, no run angled in towards the stumps, pushed back to mid-on;
64.1;?;Harris to Bairstow, no run good length, tight around off stump but Bairstow is confident enough in his judgement to leave;

A change to the attack, with Harris replacing Bird
 Innings Start
12.15 So Australia have sneaked a lead of 32 but England will be delighted with that comeback from 205 for 4. Pretty even stevens and all will depend on how England bat second time around, that's coming up in 10 minutes...

89.3;W;Broad to Harris, OUT full length, batsman caught on the crease, it looked straight, did he nick this, not out given, England review. Harris got across his stumps, it looks very straight, any edge? Nope, Harris is already walking off. I think there were too pads which might have deceived the umpire. Good review from England, Hawk Eye has it dead plumb on middle stump. Tony Hill gives it out but everyone is already half-way back to the pavilion, five wickets for Broad, a very good display, yesterday especially;Ryan Harris lbw b Broad 28 (51m 33b 5x4 0x6) SR: 84.84;
89.2;?;Broad to Harris, no run length ball just outside off, Harris pushes carefully to Root again and a classically-British sarcastic cheer goes up as Root fields successfully this time;
89.1;?;Broad to Harris, no run full length on off stump, driven firmly to extra cover where Root fumbles but Harris had no interest in the single;
88.6;?;Anderson to Bird, no run bumper that Bird doesn't do much to but the ball avoids him;
88.5;?;Anderson to Bird, no run Bird keeps this out on the crease around off stump;
88.4;?;Anderson to Bird, no run caught on the crease, large appeal for lbw, England have a review left if they want to gamble, it looked close, perhaps it was high, or maybe sliding down a touch;
88.3;?;Anderson to Bird, no run pokes outside off and gets beaten again;
88.2;?;Anderson to Bird, no run just back in length but wide enough for Bird to ignore;
88.1;?;Anderson to Bird, no run probing line just outside off stump, Bird forward to poke at it, plays and misses;
87.6;?;Broad to Harris, no run full length outside off, a wild, wild swing outside off stump, connects with nowt but fresh air;
87.5;?;Broad to Harris, no run better length just outside off stump, dabbed into the covers from the crease;
87.4;4;Broad to Harris, FOUR runs and another! Full on off stump and slapped down the ground past mid-off, lovely timing again, excellent little knock this;
87.3;4;Broad to Harris, FOUR runs another goodun, full on the stumps and flicked past mid-on, well timed and four more;
87.2;4;Broad to Harris, FOUR runs pulled from just outside off, good connection, Bresnan comes round at deep midwicket and almost runs around it, slides and can't get there, curious bit of fielding, good shot though;
87.1;?;Broad to Harris, no run just back of a length around off stump, Harris blocks into the covers;
86.6;?;Anderson to Bird, no run super nut, full and swinging away a little to beat the drive outside off, cracker for anyone first up;
86.5;W;Anderson to Lyon, OUT full length at the stumps, Lyon plays right across it and is given out lbw got too far across his stumps and is caught in front of middle and leg. Anderson fired it in fuller and straighter and it deceived Lyon who planted his front foot on off stump, swung across the front pad but missed and when that happened, Aleem Dar was in no doubt that it was out;Nathan Lyon lbw b Anderson 4 (10m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;
86.4;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run touch wider so Lyon able to shoulder arms;

86.1;?;Anderson to Harris, no run just back of a length on off stump, Harris defends solidly up the wicket;
85.6;?;Broad to Lyon, no run full ball just outside off and Lyon walks towards it and then plays a funny flicky drive at it and misses;
85.5;3;Broad to Harris, 3 runs even better stroke, steered away off the back foot and runs it past point for three, very controlled, poor line from Broad;
85.4;?;Broad to Harris, no run goes again, this time there's a smart save at point, some hesitation whether to run on the misfield but they eventually decide against it;
85.3;4;Broad to Harris, FOUR runs overpitched outside off and nicely driven through cover for four, poor ball put away well, every run vital of course;
85.2;?;Broad to Harris, no run full length at the stumps, a jabby push played toward mid-on;

Morning everyone, good start for England, now can they use the new ball effectively?
 Innings Start
Superlative effort from Ryan Harris as he leads Australia off to a standing ovation from the crowd. The second new ball was always going to be crucial, and Harris stunned England, shattering the stumps of Bell and Prior in successive deliveries. But again, the England lower order has stood up, 45 for Bresnan, 30 for Swann, Broad hitting a few boundaries. England have been bowled out, but not before adding 96 in just over 20 overs. They knew survival against the new ball was a bit of a lottery, so they've fallen swinging.
What about Harris? His body has held up, beyond many expectations, and he's given it everything. The new ball misbehaved as if on the worst of hangovers, but it had to be put in the right place, and Harris did that
95.1;W;Lyon to Anderson, OUT that will be it, Haddin goes up immediately as Anderson pushes forward, HotSpot shows a faint mark on the outside edge, Aleem Dar's finger goes up immediately, and Anderson is off and jogging back to the dressing room;James Anderson c ?Haddin b Lyon 0 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
94.6;4;Harris to Swann, FOUR runs the lead is two short of 300 now as Swann continues to back away to leg, this time slices a back of a length ball, and it flies too fine for third man;
94.5;?;Harris to Swann, no run there is third man in place, and Swann has gone to the leg side again to steer a shotish one in the air, but it has fallen well short;
94.4;?;Harris to Swann, no run comes in to off stump after pitching good length, but Swann has no issues in blocking it;
94.3;?;Harris to Swann, no run uh oh, Harris lets loose a waist-high full toss to the backing-away Swann, who manages to get bat on it;
94.2;4;Harris to Swann, FOUR runs more authority, against Harris too, he goes way outside leg stump, Harris follows him with a full one on leg, and Swann slaughters it over extra cover;
94.1;4;Harris to Swann, FOUR runs hello, Swann is all authority as he opens the face off the front foot to send a length delivery purring between extra cover and mid off;
93.6;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run Anderson survives the over, pushes forward to extra cover;
93.5;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run pushed down the track;
93.4;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run comes forward, bat in front of pad to block;
93.3;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run;

93.1;?;Lyon to Swann, no run defended off the front foot;
92.6;W;Harris to Bresnan, OUT oh well, as soft as you get, and Harris has his best figures, Bresnan was playing from the crease, he's tried to work a pitched up delivery to the leg side but has just popped it back tamely to the bowler, he is getting a standing ovation as he walks off, well-earned too, he's put England within sight of a lead of 300;Tim Bresnan c & b Harris 45 (103m 90b 6x4 0x6) SR: 50;

92.2;?;Harris to Bresnan, no run moves in past Bresnan's flail to hit the pad, going down leg;
92.1;3;Harris to Swann, 3 runs overpitched, on off stump, Swann sends it straight down the ground with a neat forward step;

Morning, all. Bresnan hitting boundaries, Harris hitting stumps and gloves. More of the same coming up?
 Innings Start
So another fabulous Test match, the longest form of the game yet again proving why it's by far and away the best. And in the long evening sun of the north east, on debut for an Ashes Test, England have won the Urn. All the best reaction and analysis coming up form our guys in Durham so stay tuned and also have a look out our fancy new photo gallery. But that's all from Chester-le-Street, thanks to Monty and Gnasher and my colleagues in India for the commentary this week, we'll all be back for the fifth Test at The Oval, a week break before we reconvene on August 21, see you then and from me, Alex Winter, bye for now.

Presentation time...another sombre interview with Michael Clarke: "At the end of the day to only lose by 74 runs, we can take positives but our middle order wasn't good enough today. Clusters of wickets happen unfortunately. In the first innings we couldn't capitalise either. But Chris Rogers and Davey Warner played really well today. They might have found it easy but we certainly didn't in the middle. Ryan Harris was outstanding too. We've still got a lot to play for, The Oval's very important and we'll look to improve there."

And now a man who can add his name to an illustrious list of Ashes winning captains, Alastair Cook: "That noise in that last session was fantastic. The support we get on around the world is superb and we thank all our supporters. It was a fantastic wicket to play on. It was a great spell from Broad, words don't do it justice. The character and skills to turn it around after tea. We talk about bowling in partnerships and Bresnan banging away going at one an over was very important. Broad gets on those runs time and time again and when he gets it right he's very hard to play. Ian Bell played another oustanding innings, he's in great form and great to watch and has had a fantastic series."

Stuart Broad is the Man of the Match for his 11 wickets in the match. That really was something, an irresistible force when he gets it going.

Almost forgotten to mention Ian Bell, he made another vital century that put England in a strong position. His third Ashes ton, just the 10th time an England player has made three centuries in an Ashes series. But he might be shaded by Broad for the Man of the Match award.

For Australia, well, oh dear they've lost again but once again have given England a real shock. And when David Warner and Chris Rogers put on a century opening stand it was the tourists in the box seat to chase down this target. They will be very annoyed they couldn't capitalise on that great start. Ryan Harris will be especially annoyed because he's put in another great shift, 7 for 117 in the second innings, that set up a very good chance of victory but it wasn't to be and now there's only pride to play for at The Oval.

Broad's a funny character isn't he? Just gets on these miraculous sparks of form, rolls his sleeves up, tears in and rips out wicket after wicket. That's what he's produced this afternoon, steamrolling Australia who couldn't make the most of a superb start. But Tim Bresnan's dismissal of David Warner, a beauty that bounced a little to take the outside edge, shook England into life and Broad took it from there.

What a day of Test cricket, it ebbed and flowed, bobbed and weaved but England have come through thanks to an inspirational spell of bowling from Stuart Broad. Australia were in great shape at 109 for 0 chasing 299 to win but Broad ripped into the Australians and his 6 for 50 has given England victory by 74 runs and an unassailable 3-0 lead in the Ashes. They have won the Urn for the third series in a row, congratulations to Alastair Cook and his team.
