Wow, 91 runs from the last seven overs. Australia show again that it's not enough to get rid of their top-order, that they can fight back from really tough situations. They haven't won the game yet though, Sri Lanka's batsmen have a tough ask ahead of them though. Remains to be seen whether they opt to open with Jayasuriya or Dilshan.

The Sri Lankans are huddled up, waiting for the Australian openers to make their way. Watson and Warner, the two Ws, delivered an excellent start for Australia in their previous game against India, helping post a score that proved well beyond their opponents' reach. It's Watson to take strike.

Time for the toss: Australia have won the toss and will bat. They are unchanged. Sangakkara says he would have batted first. Three changes for Sri Lanka. Dinesh Chandimal, Chanaka Welegedera and Suraj Randiv come in. No Kulasekara or Perera, and of course no Murali, for he's gone back home after aggravating his groin injury.
Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the Group F game between Australia and Sri Lanka at the Kensington Oval. We've just witnessed the hosts upstaging India by 14 runs, to send them to the brink of elimination. A Sri Lankan win today will knock India out.
 Innings Start
Australia, looking unstoppable this tournament, have more or less qualified for the semis with this comprehensive win. Their top order had been blown away during their innings but Cameron White stepped to score an unbeaten 85 to revive his team. Their bowlers were ruthless, chipping away constantly to ensure there remained no hope for Sri Lanka. We'll get you the details from the presentation in a bit.
Sangakkara: "We started off well but we missed one crucial catch which probably took them to 160. We were dismal with the bat. They grabbed this match from us. The stand between White and Michael Hussey put it beyond us. Suraj Randiv stepped in very well, and created an opportunity with Cameron that went begging. We put ourselves in a hole and we hope to win our next game."
Clarke: "We're doing well. We take a lot of confidence out of today. White and Hussey were superb, and we bowled and fielded well. We've done well in these conditions, there is a bit more pace and bounce here."
White is the Man of the Match
White: "When someone misses out, someone stands up. In all facets of our game we are playing pretty well. St Lucia will throw up different conditions for us. We need to adapt and win."
That's all we have from here folks. Thanks for tuning in and sending us your feedback. It's goodbye from all of us here at Cricinfo. And oh by the way, exciting news for cricket fans in the USA - the first ever Twenty20 internationals on American soil will take place in Florida on May 20, 22 and 23rd when Sri Lanka will play New Zealand in three Twenty20 matches.

6.2;W;Johnson to Dilshan, OUT outstanding catch by Cameron White!

Jayasuriya will open and with him is the in-form Jayawardene. Sri Lanka have a tough task ahead, after squandering the early advantage with the ball to be left chasing a challenging target. Dirk Nannes has the ball; he troubled India aplenty with his nippy short deliveries. Two slips.
