Innings break Australia post 389 just days after scoring 374. All of Australia's top five posted half-centuries for just the second time in ODI history and Smith made another magnificent 104 off just 64 balls. Although in a good omen for India, they won the last time Australia did that with Virat Kohli making a 52-ball century.
They will need something similar from the skipper tonight to chase this down. India were 22 minutes over in bowling their 50 overs. But they were 37 minutes over in game one and only got fined for being one over down.
Saurabh will be back soon for the start of the chase.
Elsewhere, India's top athletes, who've traveled for tournaments since the coronavirus pandemic arrived, have their own unique stories to tell. Read more here.

25.4;1;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run length on the stumps, goes back and pushes through square;
25.3;W;Jadeja to Smith, 1 run, OUT Warner might be run out here. He pushed hard for two, it was his call, and he made the dive too, but the man at long-off scored a superb direct hit. And he's out. That's a bit of luck, there was no need to push for that second. Shreyas Iyer the fielder, who's done really well running in quickly and releasing the ball fast. The ball was on a length, held up a bit and Smith was into his chip a bit early. That meant the ball went in the air slowly before bouncing to Iyer. That made Warner think of the second, he pushed Smith for it. Costly call.;David Warner run out (Iyer) 83 (77b 7x4 3x6) SR: 107.79;

22.1;?;Shami to Finch, no run good length outside off, punched towards extra cover;
21.6;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run looked to launch that over long-on but doesn't time it that well and it bounces to the man on the boundary there;

2.37pm The umpires head to the middle. India walk out to a huge roar. Warner and Finch follow them out.
2.35pm For the India fans out there, Hardik Pandya did suggest in an interview on Fox Cricket a few minutes ago that he might be ready to bowl in the T20s. But he said "we will have to wait and see on that."
2.32pm Hello everyone. Looking forward to today. Should be another high-scoring encounter.
Vignesh: "I think asking the Gills and Pandeys to spend time on bowling might end up sending a wrong message, as they might end up concentrating too much on it.. remember kedar jadhav was once a WK , but almost ended up being a regular in the playing XI at once simply becoz he could bowl some extra overs.. but his batting never really clicked and he is out of the team now"
Vangmay: "The issue of balance to the Indian team can't really be solved much within this squad. I keep looking at IPL and Domestic top run getters and literally nobody bowls, and our long tail has always been an issue plugged in by players like Bhuvi. "
2.29 pm: India copped a 20% fine on their match fee in the first ODI due to their slow over-rate. I'm thinking of starting a joint petition alongside Alex and Thilak to distribute some of that 20% to us since they made our working hours (a lot) longer? anyone care to join? On which note, here's Alex to take you through the first bit of play.

Henriques has been around for more than a decade. Sometimes we tend to forget that. This was his debut. Gnasher remembers that one.


Playing XIs:
Australia: 1 David Warner, 2 Aaron Finch (capt), 3 Steven Smith, 4 Marnus Labuschagne, 5 Moises Henriques, 6 Alex Carey (wk), 7 Glenn Maxwell, 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood.
India: 1 Shikhar Dhawan, 2 Mayank Agarwal, 3 Virat Kohli (capt), 4 Shreyas Iyer, 5 KL Rahul (wk), 6 Hardik Pandya, 7 Ravindra Jadeja, 8 Navdeep Saini, 9 Mohammed Shami, 10 Jasprit Bumrah, 11 Yuzvendra Chahal.
Only the one change for Australia with Henriques in for Stoinis. India unchanged.
2.12 pm: Australia have won the toss and chosen to bat.
Virat Kohli: A bit rusty in the first half. No excuses there, we've played 50-over cricket in the past too. But we did see that after the 30-over mark the bodies started to slip because we haven't played in a while. I think the second half was very encouraging, we kept going despite losing four wickets. You don't want your bowlers to not have time to think, especially at the death, last 10 overs. (We need) Intensity in the field, having the right fielders in the right places.
Aaron Finch: There's a little niggle in his side (Stoinis), don't want to push him too early. Moises Henriques replaces him. (Cam Green) was in consideration, but it's about the number of overs Moises can give us. The pitch got better as it went on in the last game.
2.07 pm: Glenn McGrath says the pitch for this game does look a bit used, but it has a decent covering of grass. Some bare patches too, which might take turn later, especially given the heat.
Meanwhile, for now, India can't count Hardik Pandya as an all-round option, because Hardik is still not match-ready with bowling. "The World Cups are coming. More crucial series are coming. Whenever it is required," was what he said about resuming bowling.
Sameer: "While the sixth bowling option is a concern, a bigger concern for India, in my opinion, is its fielding. Too many dropped catches and midfields in first ODI. Hope they can shrug off the cobwebs today. "
Vignesh R: "Vijay Shankar looked promising in few opportunities given to him, Imdia should give few more chances for him to establish as batting allrounder"
1.58 pm: Sid Monga has elaborated on the 1d problem India is wrestling with in some fine detail. His proposition? "A message has to go out to the Gills, the Iyers, the Pandeys: if you want to bat for India, you have to bowl five overs in every List A game and spend a lot of time on it in the nets."
Abhijato: "India needs to back its players rather than tinkering with the combination too much. This a young side, surely they deserve a bit of backing after just one bad day at the office?"
- Absolutely Abhijato. But it's a question of the team structure that people are pointing to, rather than backing or not backing players.
Pranay: "What a master class going on from Philips in the other match. "
Indeed Pranay. Glenn Phillips is batting on 77 off 34, which might well change by the time I type this.
Ranodeep Dutta: "Hope Natarajan gets and opportunity today instead of Saini. I am really excited to see him bowl to Warner. Hopefully he gets a chance either today or in 3rd odi. "
1.51 pm: India will be pondering their balance issues, but it isn't as if they have a swathe of allrounders to call on in their squad, as I say in my preview to this second ODI.
Thinkbig : "Hope Shubman Gill, finds a spot today. Too good a talent to remain on the sidelines"
- He's a fabulous talent, but I don't see him replacing any of the top five. And what India need now are batsmen who can turn their arms over.
Henry : "Are they playing on the same pitch as Friday?"
- No, it's a new pitch, Gnasher tells me.
There were some interesting figures thrown by the high-scoring first ODI, from Steven Smith's speed of scoring to the Indian bowlers' ballooning economy rates. Our stats whiz Bharat Seervi has gathered all the numbers.
1.46 pm: Australia are going to have one change. Marcus Stoinis went off injured in the first ODI, so someone will have to replace him. Who will it be? The in-form Sean Abbott? The exciting young Cameron Green? The like-for-like Moises Henriques?
We've got Andrew McGlashan at the venue, and this is what Gnasher says: "Afternoon from the SCG. It's a scorcher of a day - 40 degrees at the moment - and while the players will be used to such conditions it's probably not an afternoon to be bowling first. There is due to be a cool change to come through in a few hours, so the evening should be more comfortable. We are awaiting news on who comes in for Marcus Stoinis in the Australia side."
1.40 pm: Hello and welcome to our live ball by ball coverage of this second Australia v India ODI. I am Saurabh Somani and will be joined by Alex Malcolm, with Thilak manning the scoring.
 Innings Start
11.04 pm: Well that's a wrap on this game from us. Australia have taken the series at the first opportunity. They've been the clearly superior team in both games. It's goodbye from Alex, Thilak and me for now, but make sure you tune in for the third ODI after a couple of days.
Moises Henriques: It is the most I've bowled for a little while so I was starting to get a bit sore there towards the end. Just tried to bowl as straight as possible. If you could hit the right length, it worked. I just tried to smack that length with changes of pace. (on his catch off Kohli) Yeah it was a really big wicket. I wouldn't be out of place in saying I'm pretty sure after we got Virat that a lot of guys were a lot calmer on the field. Thankfully he didn't hit it as well as he wanted to and I was able to get across without thinking too much. Those two innings from Steve... I've been lucky enough to play a lot of cricket with him and the timing he's showed in both games is extraordinary. You look up and he's 40 off 30 and you've not realised it. He's able to accelerate and score all around the field. I haven't seen him time the ball as well as he has in those two innings. The boys keep taking the mickey out of him because he says to anyone who'll listen 'he's found his hands' but maybe there is something in it!
Aaron Finch: It was I guess (perfect perfomance with the bat). Anytime you get in the high 300s is good. Very pleased to wrap it up in two wins. No idea (on Warner's fitness). We've got to reshuffle it around, I don't think he'll be available. Bit quicker would have been nice (on his own batting) but laid the foundation for the guys at the back end to come and play free cricket. The way Davey played up front was unbelievable. Then Smithy played out of his skin for two matches in a row. Henriques bowled to a simple plan and changed his pace a lot. As Virat said, we probably got a blueprint with Hardik's bowling, he was really hard to hit with pace off deliveries.
Virat Kohli: Completely outplayed. I think with the ball we were not that effective. Didn't hit the areas we wanted to consistently. They've got a strong batting lineup and know the angles. Their total was a bit too steep, if you see we got 340 and still lost by 51 runs. With the areas they bowled, they were in a position to create chances and with those chances taken, they were on top. (on Hardik bowling) I think he gave away a bit of a bowling plan on this pitch, a lot of them bowled cutters (smiles). His bowling was out of nowhere I just asked him. KL and I thought even 100 in the last ten overs with Hardik to come was achievable. If KL and me had stuck around till the 40th over, we could have put them under pressure. The wicket was beautiful to bat on.
Steve Smith is Man of the Match again: I think last innings I probably could have been caught at long on, a close lbw. I didn't give any chances today and I just felt good from ball one. I was able to get myself in and go hard. Another great foundation set by Finchy and Davey. Let me go hard at the back end. The last two games, the boys have got us off to terrific starts. We know India have a good batting line-up so we needed big totals. I tried to whack the ball too hard in the IPL but I've started hitting it with more finesse I should say, which is working for me. Nice to score some runs again for the team and get us to a good total. I thought the boys were outstanding in the field as well.

10.46 pm Australia take the series with an unbeatable 2-0 lead. Two comprehensive wins, driven by their batting. Both times they put up totals that were just beyond what could be achieved. India's batting was solid enough but they had too much to chase. The bowling will cause some worries. Australia's batting is looking very robust indeed. David Warner back to his attacking best, Steven Smith batting like a dream, and Glenn Maxwell scoring at two runs per ball for fun. The only bowling worry for Australia is Starc being off-colour. His figures might not reflect it, but he bowled better than in the first game. There was that no-ball wicket, and if he can sort out the extras, it will automatically improve things.
Better over-rates in this game incidentally. Australia are 16 minutes over time, India were 22. Much better than the first ODI.

He's standing fairly deep too, and struck below the knee roll so it's as plumb as it gets. Crashing into middle stump;Jasprit Bumrah lbw b Zampa 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

45.1;6;Starc to Jadeja, SIX runs boom. This is the Jadeja who was in prime IPL hitting form. Full toss, low outside off, a yorker gone wrong. Those are not so easy to hit but Jadeja has the room to baseball slug it over midwicket. well over.;
45.1;1nb;Starc to Hardik, (no ball) holes out to deep midwicket. He had to go for the big hits, but Australia have strangled him. This was dug into the pitch back of a length and he was cramped for room, tried to pull. Couldn't control it. oh wait a minute, it's a no ball. He's overstepped. Pandya stays;
44.6;2;Cummins to Jadeja, 2 runs back of a length on leg stump, slows it up again, Jadeja pats it towards square leg and they sprint two;

43.4;W;Zampa to Rahul, OUT and he's finally caught. Hazlewood at short third man has a very easy take. After being nearly caught for two balls in a row, Rahul goes off the third, a routine top edge lobbing up to the fielder. Was swiping across the line again but this was nicely flighted and dipped, got the bounce too which ended up taking the top edge;KL Rahul c Hazlewood b Zampa 76 (66b 4x4 5x6) SR: 115.15;
43.3;2;Zampa to Rahul, 2 runs dropped by Finch running backwards from point. Went down on his knee to crash this through the offside, gets a top edge that swirls over point. The wind wouldn't have made it easy as Finch running back can't even lay hand on it;
43.2;6;Zampa to Rahul, SIX runs down the track and clears long-off. Wasn't hit cleanly, but had enough on it to go just over the long arms of Mitchell Starc at long-off.;

42.6;1;Cummins to Hardik, 1 run length outside off, cuts to cover;
42.5;1;Cummins to Rahul, 1 run chipped in the air but not in Finch's reach at point. that seemed to really stick in the pitch, on a length outside off, he was too early into his cut, it ballooned off the upper edge. Finch opts to be safe rather than try a difficult catch with the game all but sewn up;
42.4;1;Cummins to Hardik, 1 run full outside off, gets low and drives to deep point;
42.3;4;Cummins to Hardik, FOUR runs back of length on the stumps, Pandya doesn't try to hit it too hard this time, so even though he's not hit it very fluently, he's timed it well enough to find the deep square leg boundary with his pull;
42.2;1;Cummins to Rahul, 1 run back of a length outside off, slashed to deep point;
42.1;1;Cummins to Hardik, 1 run yorker length outside off, he gets bat down horizontal to steer it. Flies to Zampa's right at short third man but he puts in a dive and gets a palm to it. can't really call it a drop;

41.5;6;Hazlewood to Rahul, SIX runs nails it this time. Another full toss, Rahul backs away this time and flashes a powerful cover drive that travels flat and hard. Ashton Agar at the cover boundary dives to his right but the ball's too quick for him and actually goes all the way;
41.4;?;Hazlewood to Rahul, no run full toss in the channel again. Rahul's turn to be surprised by that and miss connecting. Aimed a big drive at it;

41.1;1;Hazlewood to Rahul, 1 run full outside off, driven to deep cover;
40.6;?;Cummins to Hardik, no run and that is a sensational end to the over by Cummins. Slips in a full toss that's dipping a tad, I don't think Pandya was expecting that at all, ends up beaten once again while trying to punch it. Reacted late to the full toss;
40.5;?;Cummins to Hardik, no run length well wide of off stump, moving across again, throws his bat at it to crash through offside but he hasn't nailed a single shot this over. This one takes the under edge and bounces to Carey;
40.4;?;Cummins to Hardik, no run fuller and still wide of off. Pandya stays still that time and launches into a booming drive, but only connects with air. This is superb from Cummins to a big-hitter like Pandya who is in form;
40.3;?;Cummins to Hardik, no run and this one doesn't bounce as much as Hardik thought. Moving across, covers the line well to pull this, but the ball goes under the bat;
40.3;1w;Cummins to Hardik, 1 wide full toss, this one is just beyond the line of control, so to speak, and it's a wide;
40.2;?;Cummins to Hardik, no run great bowling. He was moving across but the bowler still kept it wide outside off, and just inside the tramline. Pandya decides again reaching for it and potentially mis-hitting;

38.3;1;Cummins to Rahul, 1 run moves across and tries to smack a pull shot to the boundary but doesn't get the timing or placement quite right. Bounces down to deep midwicket;

37.6;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run fuller on the stumps, driven to deep cover;

37.3;?;Starc to Rahul, no run yorker on middle and off, mis-times his drive to mid-off;

37.1;?;Starc to Rahul, no run angling into him on a length, pushed back down the pitch;
36.6;6;Hazlewood to Hardik, SIX runs Pandya power. That's not such a bad ball but when he nails his shots, there's no stopping them. A touch too short and he swats it across the line - goes flat and hard, all the way over deep midwicket;

34.5;W;Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT Super catch by Henriques at midwicket. Kohli got out in a similar manner in the first ODI and Hazlewood has provided a huge breakthrough.
