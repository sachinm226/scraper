Data
1610hrs From 2 for 0, and 3 for 16, Pakistan have done well to reach 212, thanks again to Umar Akmal and Fawad Alam, and Shoaib Malik. Will this be enough to prevent a whitewash? Seems unlikely, but the pitch is cracking up, so can't completely count Pakistan out. Join us for the chase in half an hour.

49.2;W;McKay to Iftikhar, OUT Ponting picks this one late, and then virtually flies across to hold onto this one.

47.6;?;Johnson to Iftikhar, no run backs a way a touch, Johnson bowls full and wide, Rao misses;
47.5;?;Johnson to Iftikhar, no run another one takes it in the helmet - Rao, after Malik and Sarfraz - this is a sharp bouncer, Rao gets in line to fend, but realises it has got big, and takes his eye off and presents it the helmet;

46.6;W;Harris to Naved-ul-Hasan, OUT that's No. 3 for Harris, the third five-for is still on! Rana is expecting a yorker and stays in the crease, Harris doesn't go for the yorker, instead a fast and straight length delivery, aimed for the off stump, Rana pushes at it away from his body, and loses his off stump;Naved-ul-Hasan b Harris 8 (5m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33;

44.5;?;McKay to Fawad Alam, no run incredible slower ball, this is the slow slower delivery, 109ks, has no idea about this legcutter as he shuts his eyes and prays this one doesn't hit the stumps - it doesn't;
44.4;1;McKay to Sarfaraz, 1 run slower ball, this team he can lean back and get a single to third man;
44.3;?;McKay to Sarfaraz, no run looks to run this down to third man, and nearly plays it on;

43.5;?;Harris to Sarfaraz, no run stays back and looks to cut, and plays all over it;

41.2;1;Harris to Afridi, 1 run length ball, doesn't go for the big shot but for the single, Ponting dives full length to his left from midwicket, back-hand-flicks it as he is diving, doesn't find the stumps, would have been tight had he hit direct;

16.4;1;McKay to Malik, 1 run close to off stump, but manges to run it down to third man;
16.3;?;McKay to Malik, no run back of a length, no room, Malik goes back and across and defends;
16.2;1;McKay to Umar Akmal, 1 run this time he gets across again, covers the line of the ball, and then opens his face on it for a single to third man;
16.1;?;McKay to Umar Akmal, no run moves across, misses out on his attempt to work this fine, can't be given lbw as it is headed down the leg side;
15.6;1;Hopes to Umar Akmal, 1 run steered away to third man for the fifth single in the over;
15.5;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run hit back to the left of Hopes, but he fields well;
15.4;1;Hopes to Malik, 1 run yes and no with this single to backward point, Umar is quick so Ponting has to go to the non-striker's end, but Malik has made it easily;
15.3;1;Hopes to Umar Akmal, 1 run and good running again, soft hands, and the ball has hardly even crossed the stumps at the non-striker's end by the time Akmal makes the single;
15.2;1;Hopes to Malik, 1 run moves across the stumps, and works this one towards square leg for a single;
15.1;1;Hopes to Umar Akmal, 1 run good running, plays this one with soft hands towards mid-on, and comes through for one;

14.5;1;McKay to Malik, 1 run shimmies down the pitch, plays with soft hands, and gets a single to wide of backward point;
14.4;?;McKay to Malik, no run gets back to off line, and Malik defends towards cover;
14.3;4;McKay to Malik, FOUR runs opens up this time, and not much risk in this shot, it's a length ball, wide of off, comes forward, opens the face and goes over cover;
14.2;?;McKay to Malik, no run wide of off, Malik comes forward and defends;
14.1;?;McKay to Malik, no run clipped away off the pads, but a diving Shaun Marsh means McKay is yet to be scored off;
13.6;4b;Hopes to Umar Akmal, 4 byes how did he miss that one? this is as close to off stump as you can get without actually hitting it, and Umar ends up playing inside the line of it, Haddin is blinded by the bat, and concedes four byes - don't forget Haddin is standing up to the stumps;
13.5;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run and another legcutter outside off, and once again he is stuck on the crease and pokes at it, and once again he misses the edge;
13.4;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run stuck in the crease and pushing at a fullish delivery outside off, and is beaten again;
13.3;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run legcutter, goes past the tentative poke outside off;
13.2;2;Hopes to Umar Akmal, 2 runs clears the front leg and farms this one from outside off to wide of fine leg - first runs in 24 deliveries;
13.1;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run can't get it off the square, stays back and defends an accurate delivery that is just short of a good length;
12.6;?;McKay to Malik, no run slashes outside off, misses it by light years, plays way outside its line - anyway, three maidens in a row for McKay, and three maidens in a row for Australia. One run has been scored in last five overs!;
12.5;?;McKay to Malik, no run and again, back of a length, no room, and all he can do is defend;
12.4;?;McKay to Malik, no run stays back and plays with a straight bat this time, back to the bowler;
12.3;?;McKay to Malik, no run looks to cut, but it is too full for the shot, gets a bottom edge but is safe;
12.2;?;McKay to Malik, no run beaten outside off, almost trying to edge it, looks to run it past the keeper but there are two slips in place, good thing he couldn't play the intended shot;
12.1;?;McKay to Malik, no run back of a length, just outside off, and defended towards cover;
11.6;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run fuller, beats him outside off, Haddin doesn't collect it cleanly - Hopes may not have got a wicket, but all four bowlers have begun with maidens so far;
11.5;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run not this time, he gets a big stride forward and defends towards cover;
11.4;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run shorter, just outside off, can't do much with that;
11.3;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run back of a length, outside off, gets the outside half of the bat, but is safe;
11.2;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run length delivery, comes forward and defends this one back to the bowler;
11.1;?;Hopes to Umar Akmal, no run starts on target, just off and around, Umar defends off the back foot;

10.4;?;McKay to Malik, no run fuller, closer to off, presses half-forward and defends;
10.3;?;McKay to Malik, no run leaves this one alone outside off;
10.2;?;McKay to Malik, no run just back of a length, around middle and leg, pushed towards midwicket;
10.1;?;McKay to Malik, no run accurate, just around off, defended off the back foot;
9.6;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run sure signs of dual bounce, hits a crack at back of a length, and bounces another time before reaching Haddin;
9.5;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run fuller, wider, and left alone this time;
9.4;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run beats him outside off, short of a length, close to off, makes him play, and then the angle beats him;
9.3;?;Johnson to Umar Akmal, no run another edge, and this one falls way short of White at second slip. Good sharp delivery, just outside off, has to play at it;
9.2;1;Johnson to Malik, 1 run makes him jump around in the crease, and he has no clue when the ball bounced and took the leading edge and went over gully;
9.1;?;Johnson to Malik, no run short, sharp, just outside off, gets on top of it and defends;
8.6;?;McKay to Umar Akmal, no run three bowlers tried so far, and all three have started with wicket-maidens! Akmal stays on the crease and defends this length delivery;
8.5;W;McKay to Younis, OUT another Aussie bowler gets a wicket in his first over - actually all three have struck with their fifth deliveries! And another soft dismissal here, this is a length delivery fairly wide of off, Younis gets half a move forward and pushes at it away from his body, the edge is snapped by Haddin;Younis Khan c ?Haddin b McKay 3 (34m 22b 0x4 0x6) SR: 13.63;
8.4;?;McKay to Younis, no run angling in to Younis this time, he presses forward and defends it to leg;
8.3;?;McKay to Younis, no run half-volley outside off, hit powerfully, but straight to mid-off;
8.2;?;McKay to Younis, no run gets a stride in this time, and defends towards cover - all those loose drives have been the ones that he has played in front of his body;
8.1;?;McKay to Younis, no run Younis drives again, and the bat turns in his hand early again, and instead of mid-off, the shot goes towards mid-on;

Time for the post-match presentation
Ricky Ponting: "It's been a good series, and we have been a very good one-day team in the last few series. We have got a lot of belief in the team, when you have got that belief, it's easy for the guys coming in to do well. Looking back, that bad run of injuries in India gave these young guys chances, and they have taken them with both chances."
Mohammad Yousuf: "They were better than us in all areas, they were the better team. We played really well today, came close, but Ponting and Hussey batted well. They are a really professional side, they don't take pressure, they make good plans, and execute them."
The Man of the Series is Ryan Harris, who wouldn't even have played but for an injury or three. "A month ago I was doing rehab for my knee injury, so I am pretty surprised. I am pretty close to being my best. It's good to be around with the guys. The move to Gabba has helped me, but it's not the sole reason for my being picked. It's pretty hard to break into this side, and I saw the first two match, and though, 'Gee it's good to be out here.'" Man of the Series, and had played just three games. Good on ya Ryan
The Man of the Match is Clint McKay for his 4 for 35. He says: "Definitely representing your country is what you grow up dreaming about. So I am enjoying being with the team, and hope it lasts for a bit."
What a match we have had, the best of the lot in this series. One of the best ODIs of late, just goes on to prove what fun a low-scoring close ODI can be. Better than a 414 v 411 for me. And as usual Hussey saw Australia home here, despite Pakistan putting up their best 50 overs of the series in the defence of 212. They were aggressive, they were positive, they were hustling, they were clear-headed. And cheers to Australia, who absorbed it all, and still crossed the line to hand Pakistan a 5-0 drubbing.
Adam Gilchrist hands over the winners' trophy to Ricky Ponting and delighted Australia team. Time for me, Sidharth Monga, to say good bye.
49.3;1nb;Iftikhar to Harris, (no ball) it's a beamer, what drama, surely yorker gone wrong, lobs straight to mid-off, Afridi catches and appeals, but Asoka calls it a no-ball, just above waist, so fair call. Just wondering if the modern fashion of wearing trousers low would help getting such calls in your favour;
49.2;2;Iftikhar to Harris, 2 runs Harris can't do no wrong, don't shake his hand if you are in Perth, you might just turn to gold. He just saw a length ball, and swiped it over midwicket, gets two, scores level;
49.1;W;Iftikhar to Hauritz, OUT oh is there another twist in here? Hauritz looks to work it to leg, moves too far across, the ball seams in, catches him on the crease, in front of middle, Rao you beauty;Nathan Hauritz lbw b Iftikhar Anjum 18 (26m 20b 2x4 0x6) SR: 90;
48.6;4;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hussey, FOUR runs he can't, he just drops it short. And he hates being called Mr Cricket, that's what he has been tonight, gets under the short delivery, pulls it between fine leg and deep square leg, and pumps his fist;
48.5;1;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, 1 run lovely delivery, rises from back of a length, Hauritz rises with it, gets on top of it, and gets a single down to third man;
48.4;1;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hussey, 1 run another swipe across the line, gets a single to wide of mid-on;
48.3;?;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hussey, no run swats this cross-batted, length ball, goes for the on side, hits one bounce to short midwicket;
48.2;1;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, 1 run full, gets a single to midwicket, helped by a fumble by Butt;
48.1;2;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, 2 runs Pakistan could have done without the overthrow, Alam - who has been fantastic in the field today - shies from backward point but Hauritz has made it, and there is nobody backing up either;
47.6;1;Iftikhar to Hauritz, 1 run slower short delivery, gets on top of it, runs it down to third man;
47.5;2;Iftikhar to Hauritz, 2 runs inswinging yorker, digs it out, Hussey is always going for two as it limps towards long-on, and comes back easily, helped by a wide throw from Alam;
47.4;?;Iftikhar to Hauritz, no run Hauritz back away, Rao follows him with a short delivery, cramps him, Hauritz has to get the glove in the way to protect his ribs, priceless dot;
47.3;1;Iftikhar to Hussey, 1 run full, on off, pushed down the ground to long-off, gets a single;
47.2;4;Iftikhar to Hussey, FOUR runs the rare poor delivery in the last 10 overs, short, leg side, fine leg up, Hussey accepts it with gratitude and pulls it past the lone fielder;
47.1;1;Iftikhar to Hauritz, 1 run fulltoss, yorker goes wrong, hit down to mid-off for a single;
46.6;1;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, 1 run slower ball, too straight, helped away to short fine for a single;
46.5;4;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, FOUR runs smart shot, third man is square, and he deliberately opens the face on a length delivery, all along the ground it goes, and bisects the slip and the third man;
46.4;?;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, no run superb delivery, back of a length, bounces extra, holds its line, beats him;
46.3;1;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hussey, 1 run Hussey steps down again, doesn't get any room, Hussey drops and runs, Butt at short third misses again, Hauritz was a goner had he hit;
46.2;1;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, 1 run back of a length, punched away crisply, takes off for a single, Afridi at extra cover has one stump to aim at, and misses with Hauritz not even in the frame;
46.1;1;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hussey, 1 run Hussey jumps out of the crease, pushes it down the ground, gets a single;
45.6;?;Iftikhar to Hauritz, no run not much, just the one run, as Rao finishes off with a sharp delivery, on target, Hauritz defends it back to him;
45.6;1w;Iftikhar to Hauritz, 1 wide slower bouncer goes wrong, down the leg side;
45.5;?;Iftikhar to Hauritz, no run superbly bowled, yorker, around off and middle, played back to Rao;
45.4;?;Iftikhar to Hauritz, no run slower ball, early into the shot, uppishly hit, but wide of Rao, mid-off keeps them in their creases;
45.3;4;Iftikhar to Hauritz, FOUR runs Rao bowls short and wide, and Hauritz has cut it absolutely smack off the middle of the bat, wide of cover-point, what a shot for a No. 9 to be playing in this situation;
45.2;?;Iftikhar to Hauritz, no run short, outside off, bouncer, Hauritz lets it through to Sarfraz;
45.1;1;Iftikhar to Hussey, 1 run shape away from Hussey, hit towards cover, off the front foot, gets a single;
44.6;?;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, no run inswing, late inswing, length ball, tails in from outside off, pushed to midwicket;
44.5;?;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, no run nice inswinging yorker, that's the delivery that pays most of his bills, Hauritz can't do much with that;
44.4;?;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, no run good delivery first up, back of a length, around off, defended off the back foot;
44.3;W;Naved-ul-Hasan to Johnson, OUT and what a time for Rana to strike, loose shot really, shortish, angled across him, Johnson cuts without getting close to it, the edge is snapped by Sarfraz, and Pakistan are in a huddle, they can feel it, they can sense a win around the corner;Mitchell Johnson c ?Sarfaraz Ahmed b Naved-ul-Hasan 13 (26m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 68.42;
44.2;1;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hussey, 1 run length ball, pushed across Hussey, he gets a thick edge towards third man;
44.1;1;Naved-ul-Hasan to Johnson, 1 run slightly short of yorker, Johnson gets a single wide of mid-on;

Three overs each left for Rana and Rao, will they prove to be the weak link for Pakistan, or will they stand up here and surprise Australia? Rana to bowl - 37 off 36. Mid-on and mid-off up
