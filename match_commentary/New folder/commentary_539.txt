Data
Australia have recovered superbly, thanks to David Hussey's stellar 88 off 44 balls. They were reeling at 71 for 5, but Hussey's crucial partnerships with White and Johnson have got them to a challenging total. South Africa will be a little disappointed , especially after the start they got, but they have the wherewithal to scale down this score.
We are in for some entertainment tonight, so join us in about ten minutes for the run-chase.
Paul Taylor: "Dave is brilliant. I love him, if he's not in the Ashes squad it's a disgrace."

Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the first Twenty20 international between South Africa and Australia being played in Johannesburg. The Tests are over, and the focus now shifts to the limited-overs format and both teams will be looking for some handy preparation ahead of the IPL - for those who are involved - and the World Twenty20 scheduled for June in England.
Johan Botha, who led the Twenty20 and ODI side well in Australia, will captain South Africa. There's no Peter Siddle or Ben Hilfenhaus for the visitors - both have gone home - so Johnson and limited-overs specialist Nathan Bracken could lead the attack.
There's still a while before the start, so read Peter English's preview to the game in the meantime. We'll get you the toss result and the teams shortly.
The news from the Wanderers is that South Africa have won the toss and opted to field.
Here are the teams:
South Africa: Gibbs, HM Amla, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, VB van Jaarsveld, MV Boucher, JA Morkel, J Botha, RJ Peterson, WD Parnell, DW Steyn .
So Herschelle Gibbs, Robyn Peterson and Wayne Parnell are the new inclusions. They didn't play a part in the Tests.
Australia: Warner, BJ Haddin, RT Ponting, CL White, MEK Hussey, DJ Hussey, MJ Clarke, JR Hopes, SM Harwood, MG Johnson, B Geeves
Three new names for Australia as well: Brett Geeves, David Hussey and fast bowler Shane Harwood.
Michael Clarke will open with David Warner, who is facing Dale Steyn. All set.
 Innings Start
South Africa were in deep trouble at one stage - they were 83 for 5 - but Boucher and Morkel sparked a revival with a stand of 58 for the sixth wicket. Morkel fell for a superb 19-ball 37 but Boucher stayed till the end, repeating his feat in that famous chase of 434, to guide his team to a thrilling four-wicket win.
Thanks for tuning in, folks, and sending us all your feedback. Do join us again on the 29th for the second Twenty20 international between these two teams at Centurion. Until then, it's goodbye from all of us here at Cricinfo.

Vineet: "Australia have achieved the total of 166, so as per Ananth Narayanan 90%+ chances of winning as only 4 times this much total is acheived in T20 matches."
Good spot, Vineet. Ananth Narayanan, who regularly blogs for us on It Figures, according to his analysis, feels 165 is a highly competitive first innings score in Twenty20 cricket. Can South Africa surpass it?
Hashim Amla and Gibbs to open. Mitchell Johnson to start proceedings for Australia. Two slips in place.
