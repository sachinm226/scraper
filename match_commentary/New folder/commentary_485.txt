Data
West Indies have been dismissed for 170 in the 40th over - 62 balls have been left unused. You're always going to struggle to win ODIs if you waste those many resources. Bollinger was brilliant, his first-ball dismissal of Gayle began the slide.
"Sad to see WI crumble. They are so heavily dependent on Gayle to give them a good start. That hasn't happened in the last couple of matches. Batting order needs to be re-jigged. Pollard should be given a chance up the order at 4 so he can face more overs. Hinds should replace Morton," says Ram.

1.55pm:Quite a few of you have questioned Harris' omission.
1.30pm: Good day and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the second ODI between Australia and West Indies in Adelaide. The early news is that Chris Gayle has won the toss again and this time he has decided to bat. He had put Australia in at the MCG ...
I'll have the team news for you in just a little bit. Meanwhile, check out out latest Time Out show with Harsha Bhogle, Peter Roebuck and Sanjay Manjrekar. It's about ball tampering.
West Indies are unchanged ... while Australia have replaced Ryan Harris, the fifer expert, with Clint McKay.
The teams will be up shortly. I'm told it's 38 degrees at the Adelaide Oval. You wouldn't want to be fielding first out there.
Chris: "Why would Australia dump their best bowler for this match? Harris deserves to keep his spot."
Travis: "Hi guys! Can you please explain the new "Hawkeye" feature and how to use it?"
Good you asked, Travis. I was just coming to that. Here's the explainer.
Phil: "Pressure on Shaun Marsh to get a big score tonight. He's had more starts than a car battery lately but too often out in 20's - 30's."
 Innings Start
So that makes it 2-0 in Australia's favour. Ponting seals the win with a pull over square leg to a long hop. Bollinger is the Man of the Match. Thanks for tuning in today. Do come back and see us for game three on February 12. Bye for now!

Welcome back. Hardly a target for Australia. Lets see how West Indies defend it. "We'll beat them 4-1," said Gayle before the series. Umm, yeah. On TV during the break they were showing replays of an old West Indies ODI in Australia and Lara strode out to bat. How this side could do with him. Anyhow, that's a discussion for a different day. For now, its Roach to Watson.
