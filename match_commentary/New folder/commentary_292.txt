Data
Australia have taken 147 off the last ten overs. Maxwell and Marsh's partnership was worth 109 in nine overs. Marsh making it count after a nervy start at No 3, Finch looking solid before he picked the fielder, Haddin unfortunate to fall short of his fifty, Bailey missing out, but the standout was Glenn Maxwell, with 93 off 46. This is the highest total on this ground, and Australia's 76th total of 300-plus, next only to India's 78.
Sean Williams says it is a slow surface and the spinners should not have gone for as many as they did. He says Australia's total is too much. We will be back shortly with the chase

Time for the presentation:
Elton Chigumbura: Outplayed, as simple as that. We have to keep working hard and play a different game next time. The main focus is on our batting but we keep losing wickets, we have two more games so have to keep working hard. Need to lift our spirits up and hopefully things will change in the next game.
George Bailey: Outstanding stand from Finch and Haddin and great innings from Mitch and Maxi took us to a huge total. And great work from our bowlers too. Plenty of things to improve on - no hundreds within our group. It was a good one-day wicket and there was a bit there with new ball, slowed in the middle and the ball got soft later. Maxi' shots showed the quality of hitting, it wasn't so easy to bat on.
Man of the Match is Mitchell Marsh: I didn't start slow on purpose, it took time to adjust to the wicket and we had wickets in hand so that helped. I like the No. 3 position, it was a great opportunity and hopefully I can play there more. When the wickets are flat, I'm definitely a batter.
That's all we have from the tri-series opener. Join us for the second match between Australia and South Africa on Wednesday. Hope you enjoyed our coverage, until the next game it's goodbye on behalf of Abhishek Purohit and Vishal Dikshit. Ciao!
4.45pm Australia have started the tri-series with a massive win and hence a bonus point. 198 runs is the margin after Australia piled on 350. It was always going to be tough for Zimbabwe even though Raza and Masakadza resisted with a stand of 82. But once that was broken, many soft dismissals led to an easy win for Australia. Masakadza fought till the 34th over but was running out of partners. There's not much you can do when Maxwell hammers you for a 46-ball 93.
Mitchell Johnson: The pitch was a bit slow and they bowled really well early on. It was toughish wicket and Maxi played the way he's been playing for the last 12 months. I felt good and happy, there was a soft outfield. I had five weeks at home to get ready and that played a role, I was anxious to get out there and play.
I was very happy with that [six] because I tried to hit it as straight as possible. I'm not going to apologise for that (laughs).
