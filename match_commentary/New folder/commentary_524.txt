So South Africa do well to dismiss Australia inside 50 overs. Still, a target of 270 is not easy under lights. There has been a good crowd in and they are looking at a competitive total. The spinners, especially Botha, bowled very well and tied down runs as well as taking wickets. Duminy did well under pressure. South Africa will back themselves to chase this.
We'll be back for the chase in roughly 35 minutes. You could spend the break checking got a special edition Australia-South Africa quiz, or subscribing to the

 Innings Start
The winning runs, once again, come off the captain's bat. A rather comfortable win in the end, largely due to Boucher's patience and that frenzied cameo from who else but ... Albie "I'll be there for you" Morkel. It got tight in the middle there when Australia hit back with big wickets, but Albie and Boucher changed all that.
Just a quick recap for anyone who was late to join in. Australia batted first and set a target of 270. Despite a quick start, they were bowled out for 269 in 49.s overs. Botha was in the thick of things, taking 3 for 32 in his 10 overs and two smart catches. In reply for South Africa, Gibbs found some forms in the way he knows best, belting the cover off the ball. Australia were fairly bad with their catching, dropping two in the first over and then allowing the dangerous Albie a chance during the batting Powerplay. Gibbs had some fun, Kallis propped up the innings with a fifty, crossing 10,000 ODI runs today, and then Boucher and Albie played good hands. South Africa lead by 2-1 with two games to go. Those dropped catches made if fairly easy.
Not much dispute in the fact that Albie is the Man of the Match for his 22-ball 40.
We've been Jamie Alter and Sanjay Murari. Until the next game from Adelaide on Jan 26, thats it from Cricinfo.
