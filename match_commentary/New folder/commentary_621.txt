Well, when Australia were cruising at 170 for 1 in the 30th over it seemed a 300+ score was on the cards ... but they then lost their last nine wickets for 82 in 18.3 overs in a positively Englandish performance. After an indifferent start, England bowled well but Australia contributed to their own downfall. The pitch is not a belter and England have the added problem of batting under lights, so this could be a tight second half. Join us in 40 minutes ...
48.3;W;Flintoff to McGrath, OUT full and straight and McGrath's 37th birthday present from Flintoff is to have his stumps scattered;Glenn McGrath b Flintoff 0 (4m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
48.2;?;Flintoff to McGrath, no run full toss, patted to mid-off. He is looking for the yorker ...;
48.1;1;Flintoff to Bracken, 1 run edged fine to third man;
47.6;1;Mahmood to Bracken, 1 run defensive push beats the bowler and extra cover and Bracken trots through to keep the strike;
47.5;?;Mahmood to Bracken, no run prodded into the off side;
47.4;W;Mahmood to Watson, OUT another one bites the dust ... Watson is undone by a slower ball which he lamely chips to Bell at midwicket. Watson's ignominy was compounded by the fact he then headed off towards the wrong exit and had to make a sudden and big navigational correction when he realised his mistake. The crowd spotted it and gave him a few jeers ...;Shane Watson c Bell b Mahmood 9 (31m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 69.23;
47.3;1;Mahmood to Bracken, 1 run angled poke to backward point and they risk - and get - a single to Collingwood;
47.2;?;Mahmood to Bracken, no run slower ball, inside edge to midwicket and after a moment's yes-noing, they decide to stay put;
47.1;1;Mahmood to Watson, 1 run clipped to midwicket for an easy - and almost gifted - single;
46.6;W;Flintoff to Lee, OUT Collingwood is on fire! Lee, clearly frustrated, swished and missed, the ball cannoned off his pads to Collingwood at backward point and his underarm throw hit the stumps with Lee, diving full length, a yard short;Brett Lee run out (Collingwood) 0 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
46.5;?;Flintoff to Lee, no run frustration showing as Lee tries to swipe the ball over midwicket and misses;
46.4;?;Flintoff to Lee, no run mistimed drive, Dalrymple dives full length from extra cover to keep Lee on strike;
46.3;?;Flintoff to Lee, no run Lee aims an expansive swish through the covers, gets a thick inside edge and Nixon makes a good stop diving to his left;
46.2;?;Flintoff to Lee, no run Lee rather jumpily back as he jabs down on the ball;
46.1;W;Flintoff to Hogg, OUT Hogg steps back and thumps it straight to Bell at extra cover. He timed it but right into the fielder's midriff;Brad Hogg c Bell b Flintoff 10 (16m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 90.9;
45.6;1;Plunkett to Hogg, 1 run Hogg steps back, completely mistimes a cut and hammers the ball into the ground at his feet ... but it still produces a run as Watson quick to call him through;
45.5;1;Plunkett to Watson, 1 run driven to deepish extra cover;
45.4;?;Plunkett to Watson, no run Watson again steps to leg, Plunkett sees it and follows him, and Watson can only steer the ball to point;
45.3;2;Plunkett to Watson, 2 runs Watson steps to leg and cracks it through extra cover, Strauss in the deep makes good ground to field;
45.2;1;Plunkett to Hogg, 1 run full and a wristy flick down to long leg off middle-and-leg stump;
45.1;?;Plunkett to Hogg, no run Hogg turned square and the ball squirts out to gully;
44.6;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run good delivery which Watson gently plays back to Flintoff;
44.5;1;Flintoff to Hogg, 1 run driven to deep cover;
44.4;1;Flintoff to Watson, 1 run slower ball, spotted, and turned to square leg;
44.3;1;Flintoff to Hogg, 1 run slightly overpitched and driven wide of the man in saving the one and on to long-off;
44.2;1;Flintoff to Watson, 1 run same again but this time it just evades the dive by Bell;
44.1;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run checked drive to short midwicket;
43.6;1;Plunkett to Watson, 1 run firm on-drive to the man in the deep;
43.5;1;Plunkett to Hogg, 1 run ugly reach into the leg side, but effective;
43.4;1;Plunkett to Watson, 1 run into the off side, a more comfortable single this time;
43.3;1;Plunkett to Hogg, 1 run pushed square on the off side and Collingwood in quickly and had he hit at the bowler's end then Hogg wouldn't have even been in the frame;
43.3;1w;Plunkett to Hogg, 1 wide down the leg side, Hogg shimmies inside the line and then looks worriedly at the umpire in case he wasn't going to call it;
43.2;1;Plunkett to Watson, 1 run Watson back and pushes square into the off side;
43.1;?;Plunkett to Watson, no run Watson back and plays into the leg side. Uncertainty between the two over the run;
42.6;?;Flintoff to Hogg, no run similar ball to the one that got Hussey, Hogg aims a big wipe and misses;
42.5;?;Flintoff to Hogg, no run prodded to point with a loud shout of "wait, wait, wait";
42.4;4;Flintoff to Hogg, FOUR runs short and wide, slashed in the air between and slightly over men at point and gully. Flintoff gives a wry smile;
42.3;W;Flintoff to Hussey, OUT two in two! just short of a length, Hussey shapes to run the ball to third man but it's too close to him and he gets a thin nick to Nixon. Hussey doesn't even wait for the decision ...;Michael Hussey c ?Nixon b Flintoff 17 (29m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 89.47;
42.2;W;Flintoff to Clarke, OUT slower ball, played into the off side, Collingwood swoops and throws down the stumps at the non-striker's end. Clarke must have assumed he was safe as he didn't stretch and replays show that he was a couple of inches short. A big cheer as the third umpire's verdict is shown;Michael Clarke run out (Collingwood) 33 (51m 39b 0x4 1x6) SR: 84.61;
42.1;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run checked block into the off side, fielders in like bees to a honeypot;
41.6;1;Plunkett to Clarke, 1 run Clarke turns it behind square where Panesar makes a tumblings top to a few cheers;
41.5;1;Plunkett to Hussey, 1 run driven to long-on;
41.4;1;Plunkett to Clarke, 1 run flicked off the back foot to midwicket;
41.3;1;Plunkett to Hussey, 1 run dropped Hussey takes a big stride and drives in the air to Mahmood at mid-on ...he sunk to his knees and waited for it ... and then it bounced off his wrists ... poor drop;
41.2;2;Plunkett to Hussey, 2 runs driven, slightly uppishly, between cover and extra cover;
41.1;1;Plunkett to Clarke, 1 run slower ball to start with - or perhaps he is just stiff - and it's turned to long-on;
40.6;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run Hussey hurried by that one and he can do no more than push the ball to Dalrymple at short midwicket;
40.5;1;Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run checked defensive shot, almost played on the run, and a scurried single;
40.4;1;Flintoff to Hussey, 1 run a controlled edge to third man;
40.3;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run again a decent tumbling stop by Bell at short cover;
40.2;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run short outside off stump, mistimed paddle and stopped by a sprawling short cover;
40.1;1;Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run smacked an attempted drive into his feet and a well-=run single. Always hard to stop them taking one for that;
39.6;1;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run soft hands into the off side;
39.5;2;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 2 runs turned to square leg and as the batsmen saw it was Panesar they took the second;
39.4;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run forward in a measured drive, another single;
39.3;1;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run fiddled into the leg-side for another quick single;
39.2;2;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 2 runs flashed into the covers;

38.6;1;Panesar to Hussey, 1 run opened the face of the bat, steered past gully;
38.5;1;Panesar to Clarke, 1 run;
38.4;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run;
38.3;1;Panesar to Hussey, 1 run tip and run into the leg side. Half an appeal from Panesar, and that was probably closer than his lbw!;
38.2;1;Panesar to Clarke, 1 run a bit of width, and Joyce at backward point is down quickly to cut off two runs. Good fielding;
38.1;1;Panesar to Hussey, 1 run drawn forward and pushed firmly past a floundering mid-on;
37.6;1;Dalrymple to Hussey, 1 run full-toss, but Hussey doesn't make best use of it. All the same, it's two more out to deep midwicket, and nine off the over;
37.5;?;Dalrymple to Hussey, no run good flight and direction. Pushed back up the track;
37.4;4;Dalrymple to Hussey, FOUR runs outside leg, swept fine and hard, and that's Hussey's first boundary;
37.3;3;Dalrymple to Clarke, 3 runs down on one knee, and that's threaded elegantly through the covers. Bit too much width;
37.2;1;Dalrymple to Hussey, 1 run turning again into the pads, clipped to midwicket;
37.1;?;Dalrymple to Hussey, no run sharp turn from middle-and-leg. Pushed out to point;
36.6;1;Panesar to Hussey, 1 run pushed out to cover to get off the mark immediately;
36.5;W;Panesar to Hodge, OUT Panesar has his second! Hodge was down on the sweep, and umpire Harper upholds a massive appeal! That was not a clever decision, to be honest. Hodge was a long way down, and it was way outside the line of off stump. Apart from that, pretty good;Brad Hodge lbw b Panesar 5 (12m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
36.4;1;Panesar to Clarke, 1 run;
36.3;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run;
36.2;2;Panesar to Clarke, 2 runs;
36.1;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run;
35.6;1;Dalrymple to Clarke, 1 run;
35.5;?;Dalrymple to Clarke, no run;
35.4;6;Dalrymple to Clarke, SIX runs hoisted over extra-cover for a big six! Lovely strike;
35.3;1;Dalrymple to Hodge, 1 run;
35.2;?;Dalrymple to Hodge, no run;
35.1;2;Dalrymple to Hodge, 2 runs cut to deep backward point;
34.6;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run;
34.5;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run;
34.4;1;Panesar to Hodge, 1 run width again, and this time the gap is picked;
34.3;?;Panesar to Hodge, no run bit of width and carved straight to point;
34.2;?;Panesar to Hodge, no run;
34.1;?;Panesar to Hodge, no run back of a length and turned to midwicket;
33.6;1;Dalrymple to Hodge, 1 run driven firmly back at the bowler, parried to mid-off;
33.5;?;Dalrymple to Hodge, no run sharp spin, inside edge onto the pads;
33.4;1;Dalrymple to Clarke, 1 run tight, tight run, and that's gone to the third umpire ... but the replays are inconclusive. It was punched to midwicket where Collingwood threw, but Nixon couldn't quite get the bails off in time;
33.3;?;Dalrymple to Clarke, no run drawn forward in defence;
33.2;W;Dalrymple to Hayden, OUT big, big, swing, and that's an excellent catch from Mahmood on the long-on boundary! Hayden went for the big yahoo, looked to have hit it clean out of the ground but got fractionally underneath it. The ball topped out somewhere near floodlight height, but Mahmood kept his cool, and acknowledged his inevitable barrackers in the crowd;Matthew Hayden c Mahmood b Dalrymple 82 (152m 102b 7x4 0x6) SR: 80.39;
33.1;1;Dalrymple to Clarke, 1 run floated onto middle-and-leg, clipped firmly to midwicket's left. Another single;
32.6;1;Panesar to Clarke, 1 run tip and run again to midwicket. If he'd hit he was out, but the throw was wild;
32.5;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run wild slog, ugly slog. That was a quicker ball from Panesar, and nearly fizzed through to off stump;
32.4;1;Panesar to Hayden, 1 run pushed into the leg-side, and they hustle through for another quick single. Had to scamper as mid-on was swooping;
32.3;1;Panesar to Clarke, 1 run driven up to mid-on;
32.2;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run fraction shorter, and nudged down to third man;
32.1;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run bowling, Monty, bowling;
31.6;1;Dalrymple to Clarke, 1 run driven down the ground;
31.5;?;Dalrymple to Clarke, no run quicker ball, and wide outside off stump;
31.4;1;Dalrymple to Hayden, 1 run nudged into the off side for a quick single;
31.3;?;Dalrymple to Hayden, no run squared up a fraction, but clipped fine;
31.2;1;Dalrymple to Clarke, 1 run bit of tweak from a good length, played out to square leg;
31.1;1;Dalrymple to Hayden, 1 run clipped into the leg-side;
30.6;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run excellent ball-on-a-string stuff from Panesar. Tidy and successful over;
30.5;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run bat and pad firmly together as this one is defended as well;
30.4;?;Panesar to Clarke, no run solid delivery, nice flight and loop, watchful defence from the new batsman;
30.3;1;Panesar to Hayden, 1 run width for Hayden, and driven out to point;
30.2;1;Panesar to Clarke, 1 run good line and length to start, and a measured push to get off the mark;
30.1;W;Panesar to Ponting, OUT What a catch! Brilliant pluck from Collingwood at short cover - that was a bit of a filthy long-hop from Panesar, to be honest, but Ponting rocked back and clobbered it - it was in the air for too long and Collingwood dived back and across to his left, and clung onto a one-handed screamer!;Ricky Ponting c Collingwood b Panesar 75 (109m 75b 7x4 0x6) SR: 100;
29.6;3;Dalrymple to Ponting, 3 runs Ponting drives rather uppishly over extra covers, tag fielding in the deep which all goes rather wrong and to the jeers of the crowd they run an extra one;
29.5;1;Dalrymple to Hayden, 1 run Hayden back and flicks that just behind square on the leg;
29.4;1;Dalrymple to Ponting, 1 run Ponting opens his arms and smashes that past extra cover;
29.3;?;Dalrymple to Ponting, no run nothing shot, into the covers, no run;
29.2;2;Dalrymple to Ponting, 2 runs angled behind square on the off;
29.1;1;Dalrymple to Hayden, 1 run a single into the leg side;
28.6;1;Panesar to Hayden, 1 run pushed to leg for a single;
28.5;1;Panesar to Ponting, 1 run oh dear. pushed into the covers, Hayden committed to the run is stranded, Dalrymple underarms to Panesar who makes a complete mess of it, demolishing the stumps as he tries to collect the ball and there are overthrows to add insult to injury. The throw wasn't great but even so ...;
28.4;?;Panesar to Ponting, no run no run into the off side;
28.3;4;Panesar to Ponting, FOUR runs Ponting takes two big strides and makes the delivery into a half volley, thumping it over mid-on;
28.2;1;Panesar to Hayden, 1 run Hayden goes back to a slightly short one and paddles it to long-on;
28.1;1;Panesar to Ponting, 1 run placed into the covers;
27.6;?;Dalrymple to Hayden, no run driven back at the bowler who collapses in a heap to stop it;
27.5;1;Dalrymple to Ponting, 1 run more tip and run. Dalrymple has bowled well but still conceded a run-a-ball;
27.4;1;Dalrymple to Hayden, 1 run Hayden comes forward and then steps back, Dalrymple isn't fooled and in the end Hayden settles for one as he steers the ball behind square on the off;
27.3;2;Dalrymple to Hayden, 2 runs big carve over point. Plugs into the deep, and nearly a run-out as they hesitate over the second. Unusually ponderous running from this pair;
27.2;?;Dalrymple to Hayden, no run dragged down the leg-side, Hayden responds with quick feet but can't get it away;
27.1;1;Dalrymple to Ponting, 1 run pushed out to deep cover;
26.6;1;Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run leg-side, clipped to deep midwicket;

26.1;2;Flintoff to Hayden, 2 runs too leg side, clipped to deep midwicket;
25.6;1lb;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 leg bye more vim there - 89mph (143kph) which thuds into Hayden's midriff as he tries to pull it;
25.5;1;Mahmood to Ponting, 1 run a rather ugly heave through midwicket from well outside off stump, but it was short enough for him to try that even thought he didn't really get hold of it;
25.4;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run plopped into the covers but a quick shout of "no" as the fielders converge;
25.3;4;Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs short, swatted dismissively over midwicket, sweetly timed;
25.2;4;Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs ye another slower ball. Ponting waits and cracks it past extra cover;
25.1;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run slower ball, not timed into the off side;
24.6;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run pushed into the off side but this time to a man;
24.5;1;Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run Ponting drops it into the off side, no more than five yards from the crease, and comes through for one to bring up his 58th ODI fifty ... the 80th time he has passed the landmark in all;
24.4;1;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run push and run to extra cover to bring up the hundred partnership off 115 deliveries;
24.3;4;Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs super shot, full and Hayden smashes it over midwicket where it bounces a yard inside the rope. That time he did middle it;
24.2;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run pushed back to Flintoff;
24.1;4;Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs wide half-volley, Hayden frees his arms and thumps it over extra cover, not timed as well as it could have been but it still had enough gas to reach the rope;
24.1;1w;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 wide sprayed wildly down the off side;
23.6;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run another slower ball, Ponting pushes it back, Mahmood shapes to throw it back at the striker's end which would have been fine had he not completely missed picking it up;
23.5;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run into the off side which is heavily fortified;
23.4;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run Ponting turned square as he shapes to whip it through the leg side and the ball ends up squirting to extra cover;
23.3;1;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run fullish and crisply thumped straightishly to long-off;
23.2;1;Mahmood to Ponting, 1 run driven firmly to the left of mid-off where Flintoff has to slide on his knees to gather;
23.1;2;Mahmood to Ponting, 2 runs slower ball, leg side, and clipped fine where Panesar has to scuttle round from wide long leg;
22.6;1;Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run checked drive across the line and it loops a few yards short of Strauss who was charging in from deep midwicket;
22.5;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run Ponting takes a step but the ball is speared in at his feet and he can do no more than pat it back;
22.4;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run opens the face and steers into the packed off side;
22.3;1;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run full, driven to mid-off and as both batsmen set off as soon as it is hit, always a run. Mid-on is back on the 30-yard line;
22.2;1;Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run short and wide, flat batted by Ponting to deepish mid-off;
22.1;1;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run driven to deep cover;
21.6;1;Dalrymple to Hayden, 1 run clipped into the leg side and deep midwicket has to hare in to prevent the second;
21.5;?;Dalrymple to Hayden, no run a bit of a heave/sweep, hitting across the line and a loud but rather overambitious shout for leg-before;

21.3;?;Dalrymple to Hayden, no run leading edge to a flick/drive and it almost carries back to a sprawling Dalrymple;

21.1;?;Dalrymple to Hayden, no run better line, blocked;
21.1;1w;Dalrymple to Hayden, 1 wide speared down the leg side and a bemused-looking Nixon parries rather than stops;

19.5;?;PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run driven again, but not timed as sweetly and it bobbles up to extra cover;

19.2;1;PD Collingwood to Hayden, 1 run firmly pushed to long-on;
19.1;?;PD Collingwood to Hayden, no run Hayden shapes to run the ball down to third man, misses by a whisker and throws his head back in frustration;

17.4;?;PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run thumped into the covers where Strauss makes a good stop at extra cover;
17.3;?;PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run firm straight drive, Collingwood just misses touching the ball which hammers into the stumps with Hayden a long way out of his crease. Ponting then races down the pitch before being sent back himself;
17.2;?;PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run Ponting back and punches the ball into the off side;
17.1;1;PD Collingwood to Hayden, 1 run driven firmly back at - and past - Collingwood and fielded at long-on;

16.3;1;Panesar to Hayden, 1 run wide, no spin, and pushed into space in the covers;
16.2;1;Panesar to Ponting, 1 run placed into the gap in the covers for another ambled single;
16.1;?;Panesar to Ponting, no run one step, pushed firmly to mid-on, too firmly to allow the single;
15.6;2;PD Collingwood to Hayden, 2 runs same shot by this time placed wide of Joyce and a yell of "two, two" as soon as he hit it. The man in the deep had a long way to come in, so while the ball barely left the fielding circle it was easy to come back for the second;
15.5;?;PD Collingwood to Hayden, no run Hayden taps the ball into the off and thinks about a single by Joyce is in quickly at short extra cover;

14.6;2;Panesar to Hayden, 2 runs quicker delivery on leg-stump, Hayden closes the face, and that's seven effortless runs off a pretty blameless over;
14.5;1;Panesar to Ponting, 1 run one more, one more. Nothing much wrong from Panesar, but he's hampered by his field restrictions. This one was a bit shorter and wider though;
14.4;1;Panesar to Hayden, 1 run another clip through midwicket. Singles, singles, everywhere;
14.3;1;Panesar to Ponting, 1 run forward in a measured drive. One more to deep extra cover;
14.2;1;Panesar to Hayden, 1 run trading singles, as Hayden steps back and clips a gentle tweaker into the leg-side;
14.1;1;Panesar to Ponting, 1 run tidy start, floated onto a good length and pushed into the covers;
13.6;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run pushed into the covers to complete a reasonable over for England, runs-wise;
13.5;1;Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run pushed into the covers and a quick call for a single. Joyce fields well and shies, just misses at the non-striker's end. Could have been tight!;
13.4;1;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run straighter and turned into the leg-side;
13.3;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run wide half-volley, but Hayden times it too well and drives to extra cover. A let-off;
13.2;4;Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs slower ball, but that emerges as a horrid loopy full-toss. Hayden latches on immediately and thumps that down the ground!;
13.1;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run drawn forward in a defensive push.;
12.6;?;Plunkett to Ponting, no run great pounce from Panesar at deep mid-off, cuts off a certain boundary from a firm drive;
12.5;4;Plunkett to Ponting, FOUR runs ping! Right in the slot for Ponting, who swings lustily across the line and deposits an off-stump delivery over long-on!;
12.4;?;Plunkett to Ponting, no run fuller and straighter. The pitch isn't quite as fast as it might be though, and Ponting can't time his drive;
12.3;2;Plunkett to Ponting, 2 runs Plunkett's bowling on both sides of the wicket at the moment, and this time he strays onto Ponting's pads - never a good plan. Gets away with it though, as fine leg tidies up;
12.2;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run short and nudged off the hip into space on the leg-side;
12.2;1w;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 wide leg-side, poor bowling;
12.1;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run more width for the batsman, but point does well to intercept a slapped steer;
11.6;1;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run a push-and-go to mid-off. Easy run, but perhaps it shouldn't have been. Symonds, for instance, would have turned that into a run-out chance;
11.5;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run shorter and outside off stump, steered off the back foot to gully. Only 82mph so far (132kph) which is short of his usual pace;
11.4;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run forward and pushed down the ground again;
11.3;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run a double-whirl of the arms, one of Flintoff's little tricks, and a good ball too. TIghter and fuller, and defended late;
11.2;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run wide of off stump, but this time Hayden gets a bat to it in a mistimed drive;
11.2;1w;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 wide untypically untidy follow-up. Short and wide down leg side;
11.1;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run typically tidy start, on off stump and defended with a big stride;
10.6;4;Plunkett to Ponting, FOUR runs beautiful shot, just caressed on the up, all the way along the ground and past deep point. Picks the gap perfectly!;
10.5;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run driven on the walk as Hayden comes out to meet the ball. One more down to long-off;
10.4;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run good wheels from Plunkett. That was timed at 90.5mph (145kph), which is unusally sharp. Fielded in the covers, incidentally;
10.3;3;Plunkett to Ponting, 3 runs a false shot from Ponting, looking to club through the covers but instead hit all across it and out to midwicket. That was airborne for a while, but wide of the fielder;
10.2;?;Plunkett to Ponting, no run big stride outside off stump, driven without power to cover;
10.1;?;Plunkett to Ponting, no run pushed into the covers again and a loud squawk as a run is turned down;
9.6;1;Mahmood to Ponting, 1 run run down to third man to complete the first powerplay;
9.5;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run tight lines again, defended again. Australia have made a good start, but England's bowlers haven't completely surrendered the initiative;
9.4;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run drawn forward in a smothering defensive stroke. Played that almost like a spinner;
9.3;3;Mahmood to Hayden, 3 runs shovelled into the covers. Not really timed, but it is a deep and fast outfield;
9.2;1;Mahmood to Ponting, 1 run back of a length, a quick single to gully to bring up the fifty;
9.1;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run full face of the bat, tidied up by the bowler;
8.6;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run decent over, bar the wide. This one is fuller and straighter, and defended into the covers;
8.5;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run wider and left alone with a big flourish;
8.4;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run a bit of an appeal from Plunkett. Pitched in line, hit in line, and Hayden was late on it, but no-one was entirely convinced. It was going over, says Hawkeye;
8.4;1w;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 wide another wide, another one sprayed down the leg side;
8.3;1;Plunkett to Ponting, 1 run Ponting was looking to clobber that, but adjusted late and worked across the line into the leg side;
8.2;?;Plunkett to Ponting, no run fuller and maybe even a hint of late swing. Either way, short cover picks up and threatens a shy at the non-striker's end;
8.1;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run full but slightly leg-sided. Picked up at midwicket;
7.6;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run width, and that is a brilliant stop from Ian Bell in the covers. Ponting absolutely drilled that, but Bell got down quickly to his right. Good work;
7.5;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run tighter, and defended off the front foot;
7.4;1;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run carved down to third man. Too much width this time;
7.3;2;Mahmood to Hayden, 2 runs another slower delivery, misdirected this time, and turned fine;
7.2;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run slower ball, well bowled this time, and short extra tidies up;
7.1;3;Mahmood to Ponting, 3 runs you can' t bowl there to Ponting - a leg-stump half-volley is sent whistling through midwicket. Panesar at deep backward square covers great ground to save the boundary;
6.6;2;Plunkett to Hayden, 2 runs deep backward-square gets down well to save two, as Hayden clips firmly again;
6.5;1;Plunkett to Ponting, 1 run drawn forward, defended not quite off the middle of the bat. Rolls into the leg-side;
6.4;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run played through midwicket with soft hands;
6.3;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run straighter and fuller, deflected into the leg-side off the front foot;
6.2;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run a bit of a waft outside off this time from Hayden. Tried to dab it down to third man, but didn't make contact;
6.1;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run good length, defended back to the bowler;
5.6;4;Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs clattered! Two sighters and now the big yahoo through the covers! That scorched to the rope. Ponting is on a mission already, one senses;
5.5;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run pushed into the leg-side, forward to meet that one;
5.4;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run ooh, chancy! Looking to turn to leg, got a leading edge, and looped just short of cover! Lucky ...;
5.3;W;Mahmood to Gilchrist, OUT GOT HIM! And that's a big breakthrough. It was full and in Gilchrist's slot, but a touch slower, and a big swipe came straight off the toe of the bat, for Andrew Flintoff to circle beneath in the covers and take a comfortable catch. Vital wicket for England!;Adam Gilchrist c Flintoff b Mahmood 5 (28m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
5.2;1;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run a touch short but pretty straight. A neat dab to third man;
5.1;2;Mahmood to Hayden, 2 runs pushed out to point, beats the field;
4.6;?;Plunkett to Gilchrist, no run a good finish to the over. Outside off stump but not by much. No room to swing the arms into a big drive;
4.5;?;Plunkett to Gilchrist, no run fuller and better;
4.4;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run short and swivelled off the hips down to fine leg. Lucky to get away with that, as it was a bit of a long-hop again;
4.3;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run on the drive again, can't beat the field;
4.2;2lb;Plunkett to Hayden, 2 leg byes speared into the pads again. Clipped fine, but not timed;
4.1;1lb;Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 leg bye fended into the leg-side;
3.6;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run slower ball, better line and a good full length;
3.5;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run width, but not enough to work with. Cleaned up in the covers;
3.4;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run drawn forward, looking to attack, steered out to point instead;
3.4;1w;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 wide bouncer. Too short to be a danger, and a wide is called after an improbable delay from the square leg umpire;
3.3;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run back on a good length, defended;
3.3;1w;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 wide oh dear. That's not very clever. A slower ball, and it's straight down leg;
3.2;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run fuller and tighter to off stump. Defended;
3.1;1;Mahmood to Gilchrist, 1 run Collingwood at short-extra fears for his life then, but another fierce drive eludes him;
2.6;4;Plunkett to Hayden, FOUR runs poor bowling. Over-compensates with the length, bangs it in too short, and that's thumped through the covers off the back foot;
2.5;4;Plunkett to Hayden, FOUR runs fantastic strike! It's that cover-drive again, for the third time in 11 balls, and this time it's Plunkett who's bowling too full and wide;
2.4;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run better ball. A stifled appeal as Hayden is squared up, but the ball was always going over;
2.3;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run a fraction shorter, but too straight to work with for Hayden, and that's played straight to point;
2.2;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run wicket-to-wicket, turned to midwicket;
2.1;3;Plunkett to Gilchrist, 3 runs drops a touch short, and pinged off the hip and over square leg. Just helped off the hip and fielded on the boundary;
1.6;4;Mahmood to Hayden, FOUR runs and that's a carbon copy of the first ball. Full, wide, thwacked. This was more of a caress, if we are splitting hairs, but the outfield is so quick;
1.5;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run tighter to the stumps, Hayden square-drives but without much power and point tidies up;
1.4;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run steady stuff now from Mahmood, just outside off stump, Nixon takes with a flourish;
1.3;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run good line now. Hayden, with his runs already in the bag, now enjoys a few sighters;
1.2;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run better length. That one zips through;
1.1;4;Mahmood to Hayden, FOUR runs cracking shot. Too full and wide from Mahmood, and Hayden climbed into that - a juicy half-volley scuds through the covers;
0.6;?;Plunkett to Gilchrist, no run good first over. That was a bit straighter, and nudged into the leg-side;
0.5;?;Plunkett to Gilchrist, no run firm drive back down the ground. Too straight, and the stumps at the non-striker's end do the fielding;
0.5;1w;Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 wide oops, it couldn't last. A swing and a miss, and the first extra. A bit harsh, to be honest;
0.4;?;Plunkett to Gilchrist, no run tight on off stump, defended back down the pitch. Tidy stuff from Plunkett, who served up an 11-ball over against New Zealand the other night;
0.3;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run good start from Plunkett, zippy again, and a thick edge down to third man. Hayden off the mark;
0.2;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run good length on off stump, hint of drift back into the batsman, pushed into the covers off the front foot;
0.1;1;Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 run lovely start for Lee. Full, fast, inswinging onto off stump. Joyce defends cagily to point;

two slips, point, third man, cover, mid off, mid on, midwicket, fine leg
 Innings Start
Well blow me down and rewrite history. England, yes, England!, have won the first final of the CB Series by four wickets, thanks to a monumental unbeaten 120 from 133 balls from Paul Collingwood!
An unbiased view from Rick Johnson who emails: "Ned Kelly, Robert Menzies, David Campese, Kylie Minogue, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, Ian Thorpe, Yvonne Goolagong, Mel Gibson ... your boys took a hell of a beating"
The dressing-room has just spontaneously combusted, with Andrew Flintoff leading some monstrous bear-hugs. This has been a remarkable evening at Melbourne. The team that, two weeks ago, could sink no lower has just bounced back in remarkable style!
That's it from us today. No prizes for guessing the Man of the Match. I've been Andrew Miller, and from my colleagues, Martin Williamson and Andrew McGlashan, it's goodbye, and join us again on Sunday at 3.15am GMT for the second final at Sydney. It's been emotional and I need a cuppa ...
49.3;1;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run There it is! And it's Paul Collingwood with the winning runs through midwicket!;
49.2;1;Bracken to Nixon, 1 run tip and run and the scores are level! Chipped to mid-on and Nixon is too quick for the fielder;
49.1;2;Bracken to Nixon, 2 runs full-length from around the wicket, Nixon whips it fine again, and he's found space as well!;
48.6;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run full-toss, back to McGrath. A single threatened, but wisely turned down;
48.5;4;McGrath to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs drilled down the ground! That's a massive strike! Great quick feet from Collingwood, and McGrath couldn't cut it off!;
48.4;1;McGrath to Nixon, 1 run low full-toss, clipped to the mid-off fielder in the ring, but another quick single ...;
48.3;2;McGrath to Nixon, 2 runs great cricket from Nixon. Big gaps on the leg side, and he worked it expertly off his toes into the gap. England need a run a ball again ...;
48.2;?;McGrath to Nixon, no run Nixon charges, McGrath intercepts a checked drive above his head, the crowd think it's a catch, but in fact it's a dot ball!;
48.1;2;McGrath to Nixon, 2 runs full-length, whipped through the leg side, England run two to fine leg, and it's 11 off 11!;
47.6;1;Watson to Nixon, 1 run slower ball, clubbed down the ground, through long-off! 13 from 12 ...;
47.5;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run would have been out if it had hit! Collingwood looked for the sweep, played to mid-on instead and Nixon was late setting off. The shy missed by a whisker!;
47.4;1;Watson to Nixon, 1 run excellent cricket from Nixon. On off stump, tip and run into the off side. Collingwood back on strike ...;
47.3;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run wider line, and Collingwood picks the gap in the covers. England need almost a run a ball;
47.2;4;Watson to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs two fours in two balls, and that was an even better shot! Slower ball from Watson, and Collingwood scooped that up and over McGrath at fine leg!;
47.1;4;Watson to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs full-toss, and that's a vital boundary for England! Collingwood down on the sweep, picks his spot perfectly just behind square, and Brad Hodge's despairing dive can't cut it off!;
46.6;?;McGrath to Nixon, no run massive shout! But McGrath is coming around the wicket, and umpire Harper believes that's sliding down. Hawkeye doesn't agree! Lucky break for Nixon who shuffled right across his stumps;
46.5;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run wide outside off stump, pushed confidently back past the bowler, and tidied up at long-off;
46.4;1;McGrath to Nixon, 1 run a risk-free single nudged down to long-on;
46.3;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run bit of width, pushed into the covers, that's another single ...;
46.2;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run brilliant fielding by Ponting at mid-on! Dived full-stretch to cut off the run!;
46.1;W;McGrath to Dalrymple, OUT McGrath's made the difference! Inswinging low full-toss, an excellent ball in the circumstances, squirted out to point, and Clark's return to the bowler is pinpoint! Dalrymple was late setting off and was never in the frame ...;Jamie Dalrymple run out (Clarke/McGrath) 3 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60;
45.6;1;Watson to Dalrymple, 1 run played with soft hands into the covers, another sharp single completes an eventful over;
45.5;2;Watson to Dalrymple, 2 runs played out to point, hesitation in the run and Clarke's shy hits the stumps at the non-striker's end! Dalrymple is home though, and that's overthrows as well!;
45.4;?;Watson to Dalrymple, no run excellent line and length, Dalrymple gets good bat on it, but straight to point;
45.3;?;Watson to Dalrymple, no run width from Watson, but that's an air-shot first-up. It's a tough time to come to the middle ...;
45.2;W;Watson to Flintoff, OUT short, Flintoff swishes, and that's gone! It was a bit flat-footed from Flintoff, and a very, very thin graze through to Gilchrist! Watson has made the breakthrough! The end of an excellent 74-run stand, and is this a late glimmer for Australia?;Andrew Flintoff c ?Gilchrist b Watson 35 (65m 36b 0x4 1x6) SR: 97.22;
45.1;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run outside off, on a good length, but another confident swing of the bat sends the ball down to long-off;
44.6;1;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 run clubbed confidently down the ground, and Lee has been seen off. A valiant spell, but is it in vain on this occasion?;
44.6;2nb;Lee to Flintoff, (no ball) 1 run full-length again, well dug out for another quick single ... and a no-ball!;
44.5;1;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 run short, and shovelled into the leg side;
44.4;2;Lee to PD Collingwood, 2 runs top-edge loops ... safe! Lands in no-man's land at square leg, and that is Collingwood's second hundred in consecutive games, and his fourth in ODIs! Brilliant, brilliant innings, and England are inching ever closer;
44.3;1;Lee to Flintoff, 1 run shorter this time, and Flintoff has a big mow over midwicket. Decent strike brings one more;
44.2;2;Lee to Flintoff, 2 runs more frustration for Lee! Flintoff makes room and digs out another yorker with a big swing. Inside-edge to square-leg;
44.1;1;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 run fantastic ball! Speared right up in the blockhole, inswinging and ideal length. But Collingwood gets good bat on it and that's another one to the total;
43.6;?;Watson to Flintoff, no run the crowd get excited as Watson leaps to cling onto a return drive, but it's a bump-ball;
43.5;2;Watson to Flintoff, 2 runs Flintoff feigns a retreat to leg, Watson bangs it in and another two, a firm cut into the deep.;
43.4;2;Watson to Flintoff, 2 runs full length, and Flintoff gives himself a bit of room to place that firmly into the deep, wide of long-off. Picked up on the slide, but two more to the total;
43.3;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run a firm clump off the back foot into space in the covers. Short cover dives despairingly but can't cut it off;
43.2;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run slower-ball bouncer. A bit wide but Collingwood was fooled nonetheless;
43.1;1;Watson to Flintoff, 1 run down the track to meet the new bowler, picks the gap on the off-side with a measured drive;
42.6;1;Lee to Flintoff, 1 run 94mph yorker (151kph), but misdirected, and Flintoff clips a single to keep the strike;
42.5;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run banged in, but the new ball doesn't get up much and whistles harmlessly by. A precious dot ball though ...;
42.4;1;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 run crikey! Another yorker, Collingwood jabbed down late, Flintoff and Lee were in a desperate race for the line, and that is mighty, mighty tight! But not out! Flintoff's dive just beat Lee's underarm;
42.4;1w;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 wide quicker but down the leg side again! That's less good from Lee, and Gilchrist grimaces.;
42.4;1w;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 wide slower ball, but misdirected. Ironically, Australia might not mind him having another ball in this over ...;
42.3;1;Lee to Flintoff, 1 run another inswinging yorker, squirted out to point this time. Collingwood calls the single to regain the strike;
42.2;2;Lee to Flintoff, 2 runs went for the yorker, Flintoff went for the swish, and that's a thick inside-edge, squirted down to fine leg. Another single ...;
42.1;2;Lee to Flintoff, 2 runs 90mph first up (144kph) and deflected down to third man. That's the fifty stand;
41.6;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run sharp tweak, and a bit of an appeal, but always sliding down leg;
41.5;1;Hogg to Flintoff, 1 run dancing feet from Flintoff, and a smear across the line brings another run. Inelegant but effective;
41.4;?;Hogg to Flintoff, no run on the spot and respectfully played;
41.3;?;Hogg to Flintoff, no run a big swish and a miss! But Flintoff's back foot is firmly anchored as the bails come off;
41.2;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run too wide, and that's carved out to the covers, and they jog another single;
41.1;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run looped onto a length, defended back up the track;
40.6;?;Bracken to Flintoff, no run shorter and a bit of width, but Flintoff picks out point to complete the over.;
40.5;1;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run quick feet, and Collingwood is already running as this one is chipped up to long-on. Ponting looks like thunder;
40.4;1;Bracken to Flintoff, 1 run speared in on off stump. Defended with no great foot movement to point. Another single though ...;
40.3;1;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run worked into the leg side, another one notched off;
40.2;2;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 2 runs driven down the ground, excellent running brings two just as the throw comes in from the cover boundary;
40.1;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run full-length, right up in the blockhole, dug out back to the bowler;
39.6;?;Hogg to Flintoff, no run tries to give himself room to cut, misses and Gilchrist takes;
39.5;?;Hogg to Flintoff, no run full, can't force it away;
39.4;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run oops, very odd. Collingwood tries to paddle this round the corner, gets a top edge over Gilchrist's head and goes away behind the keeper;
39.3;1;Hogg to Flintoff, 1 run very full, forced down to long off;
39.2;2;Hogg to Flintoff, 2 runs down on one knee, connects well with a sweep and places it for a couple out to deep square leg;
39.1;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run short and hammered away but straight to deep midwicket;
38.6;1;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run pushed down to long off;
38.5;4;Bracken to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs slower ball chipped over midwicket, just out of his reach and away to the deep midwicket fence for a precious boundary;
38.4;2;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 2 runs short, rocks back and pulls over midwicket with enough placement to get a brace, plenty of space on the MCG outfield;
38.3;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run tries to angle it into the off side, but just finds point;
38.2;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run worked to midwicket, well fielded nothing there;
38.1;2;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 2 runs pushed forward and gets a thick outside edge which flies close to the man at backward point and down to third man;
37.6;2;Hogg to Flintoff, 2 runs close! edged just wide of slip but that's a great over for England...brings the asking rate down;
37.5;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run out to the man on the cover fence;
37.4;1;Hogg to Flintoff, 1 run pushed into the covers;
37.3;2;Hogg to Flintoff, 2 runs short this time, pulled through square leg and that makes eight off two balls;
37.2;6;Hogg to Flintoff, SIX runs bosh! that breaks the shackles somewhat, Flintoff launches this over wide long on for a maximum. That's his best shot so far by some way;
37.1;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run full and outside off stump, driven to the cover sweeper;
36.6;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run hint of reverse swing, full and into Flintoff's toes and can't get it further than midwicket. Good over from McGrath, but he's got some catching up to do;
36.5;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run punched down to long on;
36.4;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run think inside edge, into the pad and back to McGrath;
36.3;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run charges and top-edges down to third man;
36.2;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run defends, ball bounces down by his feet, Flintoff kicks it away to make sure it doesn't hit the stumps...almost thought of a single, you can't do that!;
36.1;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run well run, dropped into the off side and they both set off straight away;
35.6;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run tries to guide through point, finds the fielder;
35.5;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run;
35.4;1;Hogg to Flintoff, 1 run dropped! another leading edge from Flintoff out to cover, Mitchell Johnson is on as sub and makes a great dive but can't hold on at full stretch. What a let-off;
35.3;?;Hogg to Flintoff, no run gee, Flintoff really can't read the wrist spin. Tries to work through the leg side and almost a leading edge back to Hogg;
35.2;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run finds the gap at cover this time, out to the sweeper;
35.1;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run cut out to point;
34.6;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run along the deck this time, down the ground to keep the strike;
34.5;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run clubbed in the air down to long on, falls short of the man on the fence, not middled by Flintoff;
34.4;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run pushed out to point;
34.3;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run thick inside edge into the leg side, falls just short of Ponting at short midwicket;
34.2;2;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 2 runs wow, it's all happening. Collingwood pulls through square leg, throw goes to Gilchrist's end who throws it to Lee at the bowler's end who drops the ball and breaks the stumps with his hand...Flintoff might just have made it but another mistake from Australia. Also, if Gilchrist had broken his stumps, Collingwood was well out;
34.1;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run starts with a bumper, ducks out of the way;
33.6;?;Hogg to Flintoff, no run slammed to the man at cover;
33.5;?;Hogg to Flintoff, no run Flintoff didn't pick that, plays an ugly shot into the covers off the back foot;
33.4;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run pushed out to the man on the square-leg fence;
33.3;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run worked back to the bowler, diving save from Hogg;
33.2;1;Hogg to Flintoff, 1 run comes forward, thick inside edge dribbles way to short fine-leg;
33.1;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run worked through square leg;
32.6;W;Lee to Bell, OUT there it is! huge breakthrough for Australia. Pinpoint yorker from Lee and Bell can't get his bat down in time. Hint of reverse swing and missed it by the width of his bat;Ian Bell b Lee 65 (147m 90b 3x4 0x6) SR: 72.22;
32.5;1;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 run rides the bounce, falls by his feet, they set off and Lee charges through but can't flick the ball onto the stumps;
32.4;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run slightly cramped for room, pushed into the covers;
32.3;1;Lee to Bell, 1 run firmly driven to mid off, England notice it's McGrath there and scamper for a single. That's called picking your fielder;
32.2;?;Lee to Bell, no run behind it, into the off side;
32.1;2;Lee to Bell, 2 runs pulled out through square leg and this time it's Hayden who makes a mess of it and another couple to the total. Poor stuff from the Aussies, sorry it's been a long winter just had to squeeze that in!;
31.6;2;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 2 runs short, quicker, Collingwood latches onto it but not quite with enough power to reach the fence;
31.5;1;Hogg to Bell, 1 run pushed into the covers;
31.4;2;Hogg to Bell, 2 runs leading edge this time, loops over cover and long off is on his heels allowing two. More teapots from the Australians;
31.3;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run comes down the track, makes it into a full toss, chipped down the ground and falls short of long on;
31.2;1;Hogg to Bell, 1 run back into his crease and worked to vacant square-leg area;
31.1;?;Hogg to Bell, no run well outside off stump, but still tries to sweep. Why not drive it down to long off?;
30.6;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run bouncer, Collingwood sways underneath. Testing comeback over from Lee, he's Australia's main weapon today;
30.5;1;Lee to Bell, 1 run well bowled, hint of movement into Bell who rides it well and turns to the leg side;
30.4;1;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 run quick from Lee, 90.5mph (145kph), and an inside edge thuds into the pads and rolls out into the off side;
30.3;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run pushed into the covers, can't find the gap;
30.2;1;Lee to Bell, 1 run guided down to third man, using Lee's pace;
30.1;?;Lee to Bell, no run An 87mph (140kph) loosener from Lee and defended into the covers;
29.6;1;Hogg to Bell, 1 run and the deep square-leg man is in action again as Bell moves across the crease and works it away;
29.5;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run worked out to deep square-leg, milking the bowling with ease at the moment;
29.4;1;Hogg to Bell, 1 run edged into the gully area, they sprint through;

29.2;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run pushed to cover point for a single;
29.1;2;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 2 runs walks across his crease, turned into the leg side and another overthrow conceded;
28.6;2;McGrath to Bell, 2 runs drifting onto leg stump, turned down to fine leg and another fumble allows them back for two. The Aussies not at their best in the field today;
28.5;?;McGrath to Bell, no run turned to midwicket, but can't find the gap;
28.4;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run hit into the pad, drops by Collingwood's feet and they scamper a sharp single. Ah, here we go, McGrath's first moan of the spell...asking if Collingwood actually played a shot at that!;
28.3;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run nicely deflected down to third man;
28.2;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run worked backward of square;
28.1;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run hits the off stump line first up and Collingwood moves back and across to play from the crease;

27.1;?;Clarke to Bell, no run driven to cover;
26.6;1;Hogg to Bell, 1 run and that one is cut to backward point. Mixing things up nicely after that initial wide.;
26.5;?;Hogg to Bell, no run missed sweep;
26.4;?;Hogg to Bell, no run down the track and played back to the bowler;
26.3;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run tossed up outside off again;
26.2;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run;
26.1;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run better line and length, a bit of a leading edge but not much of a threat;
26.1;1w;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 wide that's a bit of a rank wide, to be frank. Way outside off;
25.6;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run stroked down to long-on. And England press onwards;
25.5;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run;
25.4;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run another single and that's the hundred stand from a very respectable 122 balls;
25.3;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run clipped out to leg again;
25.2;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run back on a better length;
25.2;1w;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 wide "sloppy" announces Nasser Hussain. And he's not wrong;
25.1;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run deflected past Gilchrist's gloves. Can't really call that a chance. It was played so late;
24.6;1;Hogg to Bell, 1 run glanced to backward square. Another nurdlesome over;
24.5;?;Hogg to Bell, no run full face of the bat this time;
24.4;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run singles, singles everywhere. Australia are in need of inspiration. This one is steered to gully;
24.3;1;Hogg to Bell, 1 run Bell returns the strike with another deft dab;
24.2;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run prodded out to point, and that's a very important half-century for Paul Collingwood. His 13th in ODIs, and following straight on from his hundred last week;
24.1;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run looped up and Bell is drawn into the drive. Just misses the edge;
23.6;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run slightly shorter, and punched into the gap. Ponting has a furrowed brow;
23.5;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run tossed up, and swept again;
23.4;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run good rotation of the strike. No alarms for England at the moment;

23.2;?;Clarke to Bell, no run better line;
23.2;1w;Clarke to Bell, 1 wide oops, that slipped. Another extra to the total;

22.3;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run back on a better line, delicately worked into the leg side;
22.3;1w;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 wide poor ball, down the leg side, and Hogg curses himself;
22.2;1;Hogg to Bell, 1 run big full toss, but Bell was already committed to a sweep, so rather robbed himself there;
22.1;1;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 run looped onto a good length, and swept square;
21.6;2lb;Watson to Bell, 2 leg byes too short to be a fraction off line, as that ball was. Clipped fine again;
21.5;?;Watson to Bell, no run fuller length, driven firmly to mid-on, but too firmly to get any runs out of it;
21.4;2;Watson to Bell, 2 runs short, and swung into the deep. Not much menace in the Australian attack at present. Maybe time for a bit of spin to change things?;
21.3;1lb;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 leg bye turned to leg again. The runs keep ticking over;
21.2;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run bouncer, doesn't get up much, but effective enough;
21.1;1;Watson to Bell, 1 run nipbacker, whipped fine;
20.6;2;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 2 runs fuller, probably faster and speared in at a yorker length, but Collingwood picks it early and clips through leg. Good over again for England;
20.5;6;McGrath to PD Collingwood, SIX runs walloped! Collingwood came down the track and got right underneath that, just enough legs to clear the ropes right behind the bowler's head!;
20.4;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run much better line and length. Nothing but a respectful push into the covers;
20.3;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run tighter line, turned back down the pitch;
20.2;3;McGrath to Bell, 3 runs short, wide and slapped over point. England are picking up the tempo;
20.1;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run pushed to mid-off for another jogged single;
19.6;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run another nurdlbd single, and that's a good over from England, as their runs worm begin to turn upwards;
19.5;4;Watson to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs misdirected and flicked to fine leg. Valuable runs!;
19.4;1;Watson to Bell, 1 run another quick single, but that would have been out if Ponting's throw from mid-on had hit the stumps.;
19.3;2;Watson to Bell, 2 runs outside leg stump, and that's a horrid misfield from that birthday boy again. The ball just dribbled through his legs at backward square, and he was left on all fours like a rather disconsolate giraffe;
19.2;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run tighter to the stumps, and worked to leg;
19.1;4;Watson to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs excellent lofted strike - that's Collingwood's slot, and the ball pings high over midwicket for a one-bounce four!;
18.6;?;McGrath to Bell, no run steps across and works to leg;
18.5;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run looking to advance again, and pushed down to mid-off;
18.4;2;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 2 runs down the track and shovelled into the leg-side. A little cramped on the shot as McGrath adjusted late, but got good bat on it to work it in front of square;
18.3;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run good line, good length, defended with respect;
18.3;2nb;McGrath to Bell, (no ball) 1 run fuller and swinging onto the pads, a firm clip again;
18.2;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run a bit short from McGrath and that's forcefully worked into the leg side, but tidied up in the deep;
18.1;2;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 2 runs flicked high over backward square leg. A bit of a top-edge, but safe enough;
17.6;?;Watson to Bell, no run right up to the bat on off stump, good finish to the over;
17.5;?;Watson to Bell, no run back on off stump, pushed out to point. Steady accumulation from England;
17.4;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run on the legs again, but singles are all England are after for the moment;
17.4;1nb;Watson to PD Collingwood, (no ball) attempts to work into the leg side. Misses. But they get a run anyway;
17.3;1;Watson to Bell, 1 run clipped fine. Another single;
17.2;4;Watson to Bell, FOUR runs up and under! Great strike, lofted high over the infield and down to the long-off boundary;
17.1;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run back of a length on middle-and-leg, turned to square leg;
16.6;?;McGrath to Bell, no run lovely ball, right in that off-stump channel. An attempted nurdle nearly takes the edge!;
16.5;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run fuller length on the legs, clipped away;
16.4;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run a touch more width, and this one is dabbed down to third man;
16.3;?;McGrath to Bell, no run the ever-green Glenn McGrath chips in with another fine wicket-to-wicket delivery;
16.2;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run turned to midwicket;
16.1;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run good length delivery on the off stump. Solidly into line;
15.6;?;Watson to Bell, no run good finish to the over. Wider on the crease, and defended into the leg side;
15.5;?;Watson to Bell, no run slower ball, well directed, well up to the bat, and pushed out to mid-on;
15.4;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run nurdled again, this time through square leg with a shuffle across the crease;
15.3;1;Watson to Bell, 1 run another single as this one is pushed up to mid-on. This is good running between the wickets;
15.2;?;Watson to Bell, no run bouncer, and an effective one. Bell bails out of his attempted pull, and that's the one for the over signalled;
15.1;2;Watson to Bell, 2 runs worked to fine leg, picks his gap well;
14.6;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run back in that corridor of uncertainty. Defended;
14.5;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run squirted down to third man again. England content to trade in singles;
14.4;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run quick single as Collingwood walks across his stumps and misses an attempted clip;
14.3;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run opens the face and steers to third man;
14.2;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run a fraction wider on the crease, Collingwood uses the angle to clip to leg;
14.1;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run a bit of width, and Collingwood misses with an attempted dab to third man;
13.6;?;Watson to Bell, no run very tidy first over. Just there or thereabouts throughout. A lull in proceedings for the moment, as England attempt to regroup;
13.5;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run just back of a length, eased down the ground for a gentle single;
13.4;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run slower ball, slightly wider but no real room for manoeuvre. Played out to point;
13.3;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run tight, probing stuff. Just on or about off stump, and pushed back up the pitch;
13.2;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run good shape back into the batsman. Collingwood drops the ball at his feet;
13.1;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run good start. Right on the money, and defended;
12.6;?;McGrath to Bell, no run straight through him! Bell tried to whip that through midwicket but was lucky not to get an edge to the keeper as he did so.;
12.5;?;McGrath to Bell, no run fuller - attempted yorker but a fraction off line. Pushed into the covers with no alarms;
12.4;?;McGrath to Bell, no run shorter and Bell sizes up a paddle-pull through midwicket. But instead he takes one in the midriff;
12.3;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run slightly shorter and arrow-straight. Played with soft hands into the gully for another quick single;
12.2;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run good areas Glenn. Defended with a bobble;
12.1;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run a tidy enough first delivery though. Perfect line, perfect length, softly paddled down the pitch;
11.6;?;Bracken to Bell, no run defended into the gully, and that's the end of an over that promises more;
11.5;1;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run poked out to point;
11.4;1;Bracken to Bell, 1 run dropped! And it's the birthday boy, Glenn McGrath, who grasses a sitter at square leg! Bell went for a big heave over the top, and the ball burst straight through his hands and onto his chin!;
11.3;2;Bracken to Bell, 2 runs wider and slashed over the top to third man;
11.2;?;Bracken to Bell, no run wider this time. Pushed into the covers;
11.1;?;Bracken to Bell, no run outside off stump, attempted steer into the leg side, but muffed;
10.6;1;Lee to Bell, 1 run another attempt to flick round the corner, but easily picked up by short fine leg;
10.6;1w;Lee to Bell, 1 wide speared down the leg side for the first extra of the innings;
10.5;?;Lee to Bell, no run angled into the pads again, but too quick to clip away. Fielded by Lee in his followthrough;
10.4;?;Lee to Bell, no run fuller and faster. Dug out in a hurry to great yelps from the field;
10.3;?;Lee to Bell, no run width, but at 91.6mph (147kph) it proves a little too hard to wallop. Bell misses out;
10.2;1;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 run appreciable inswing, but started on middle so easily flicked to fine leg;
10.1;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run full and fast again, defended into the leg side;
9.6;?;Bracken to Bell, no run pushed out to point to complete another good over;
9.5;1;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run pushed to mid-off with soft hands. More good running;
9.4;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run opens the face, steers to point;
9.3;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run pushed out to cover, but he was neither forward nor back, so no great power;
9.2;1;Bracken to Bell, 1 run tidy clip through midwicket. Speared into the pads;
9.1;1;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run a bit of luck for Collingwood as he inside-edges a defensive shot into the leg-side, and Bell hustles him through as Gilchrist runs round to field;
8.6;?;Lee to Bell, no run back and across, and defended into the gully;
8.5;?;Lee to Bell, no run 92.8mph (149.5kph) and aimed at the pads. Turned straight to the man on the 45;
8.4;?;Lee to Bell, no run aimed at the blockhole, angled in. Driven well, but straight to mid-on;
8.3;1;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 run shorter, and Bell hops into line to turn this round the corner. Hodge fields on the slide at backward square;
8.2;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run fended into the covers off the front foot;
8.1;1;Lee to Bell, 1 run short, Bell defends off the back foot, the ball drops into the crease and Collingwood races through for a good quick single;
7.6;4;Bracken to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs smacked! That was stand-and-deliver stuff from Collingwood. Another slower ball, picked it early, and thwacked it high over mid-on! Good batting;
7.5;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run forward in a solid defensive prod;
7.4;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run back and across very early, but it's a slower ball so plenty of time to defend it to leg;
7.3;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run slightly straighter. Collingwood has a swish again, and inside-edges onto his thigh;
7.2;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run wider, and that's a wild swing and a miss. Exasperation all round, not least from the batsman;
7.1;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run zippy and just back of a length. Collingwood steps back into his crease to steer into the covers;
6.6;4;Lee to Bell, FOUR runs edged! But all along the ground, and all the way to the boundary! Bell played that with soft hands, which was the key;
6.5;?;Lee to Bell, no run good shot for no runs, a firm clip off the legs, but Brad Hodge fields well at midwicket;
6.4;?;Lee to Bell, no run hint of width, but Bell has been forced back, and can't find the gap;
6.3;?;Lee to Bell, no run fuller and faster still (92.2mph, 148kph). Lee fields in his followthrough and shapes to shy at the stumps;
6.2;?;Lee to Bell, no run nippier this time. Back up towards 90mph (144.5kph). Defended with a hop off the back foot;
6.1;?;Lee to Bell, no run yorker length, but a slower ball - 80mph (128.8kph). Defended easily;
5.6;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run tighter to off stump this time, and defended. Another successful over for Australia;
5.5;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run angled across the right hander, left well alone;
5.4;W;Bracken to Strauss, OUT another one gone! This is getting rather chaotic for England now. A nothing sort of shot from Strauss, he shuffled across his stumps, tried to work to leg, and was trapped plumb in front. All too easy for Australia at the moment;Andrew Strauss lbw b Bracken 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
5.3;?;Bracken to Strauss, no run good tight line, Strauss is forced back onto his stumps to defend;
5.2;1;Bracken to Bell, 1 run wide again, and edged safely down to third man to bring Strauss onto strike;
5.1;?;Bracken to Bell, no run slightly wide of off stump, steered into the covers;
4.6;W;Lee to Joyce, OUT GONE! That was a horrible misjudgment from Joyce - tried to work a straighter delivery over midwicket, but instead chipped tamely to Glenn McGrath, who had to stoop forward as the ball plopped into his palms;Ed Joyce c McGrath b Lee 6 (21m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
4.5;?;Lee to Joyce, no run once again, left alone because of the late swing. That was fractionally wider;
4.4;?;Lee to Joyce, no run excellent channel from Lee. Full, fast, hint of outswing, tight to off stump. A good leave from Joyce;
4.3;?;Lee to Joyce, no run watchful this time. Playing inside the line and left alone;
4.2;4;Lee to Joyce, FOUR runs lovely strike, this time from Joyce. Too much width from Lee, but that was sweetly timed with a flick of the wrists through point.;
4.1;?;Lee to Joyce, no run good length and defended;
3.6;4;Bracken to Bell, FOUR runs thwack! That's the shot Bell's been looking for! Advancing down the pitch once again, Bracken drops short, Bell rocks back and pulls handsomely through midwicket. Promising response to their early set-back;
3.5;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run good running - a gentle nurdle into the leg side, and off for the single straightaway;
3.4;1;Bracken to Bell, 1 run slower ball, and Bell is off the strike with a checked steer through gully;
3.3;?;Bracken to Bell, no run big stride again, but defended in the end. Bell is looking to be dominant;
3.2;?;Bracken to Bell, no run more attacking intent, but this time forced back by a slight shortening of length. Nice bowling;
3.1;2;Bracken to Bell, 2 runs confident, attacking, frame of mind for Bell. Advancing down the pitch to ease Bracken through the covers;
2.6;?;Lee to Joyce, no run a bit of a slap outside off, and that bounces just short of point to complete a successful over;
2.5;?;Lee to Joyce, no run full-length on off stump, again some useful outswing probing the edge of the bat;
2.4;?;Lee to Joyce, no run width this time to the left-hander, but Joyce can't time a wafty drive. Cover fields;
2.3;1;Lee to Bell, 1 run forward, and defended into the leg side;
2.2;W;Lee to Loye, OUT The slower ball does the trick! This one was fuller, and Loye was deceived as he shuffled across his stumps. A huge appeal is upheld by umpire Harper, but Hawkeye reckons that was sliding down leg ...;Mal Loye lbw b Lee 0 (9m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
2.1;?;Lee to Loye, no run outside off again. Lee is determined to exploit Loye's weakness to the wide one. But Loye resists temptation this time;
1.6;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run lovely over. This one is fuller again, and defended into the gully. A maiden, and a tidy one. Rather like Lara Bingle, if I may say so;
1.5;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run Joyce, caught in two minds, has a dart at this one, another outswinger. Bracken is mixing it up well;
1.4;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run a big appeal, but that was sneaking down leg. No swing that time, which took it straight on, and maybe a hint of inside-edge too. Good bowling;
1.3;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run fuller and tighter to off stump. Joyce is half-forward in defence and edges that into the leg side;
1.2;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run more swing towards the slips, but Joyce plays defiantly straight, well inside the line of the ball;
1.1;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run good start for the left-armer, a curve-ball outside off stump and Joyce leaves alone;
0.6;?;Lee to Loye, no run solid start for both Lee and Loye. Full and fast again, and a well-timed defensive stroke is picked up in the covers;
0.5;?;Lee to Loye, no run width again, but too wide this time to be at all tempted. Not called as such though;
0.4;?;Lee to Loye, no run there's that troublesome area for Loye. A bit of width, and he does well not to throw the bat at it;
0.3;?;Lee to Loye, no run forward and pushing firmly into the covers;
0.2;1;Lee to Joyce, 1 run off the mark, slightly too straight and nudged off the hip;
0.1;?;Lee to Joyce, no run full, fast, inswinging, nice start for Lee. Joyce defends cagily to point;

Loye has a rearranged chin since his last meeting with the Aussies. I wonder if we'll see that slog-sweep today?
