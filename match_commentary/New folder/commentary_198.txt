15.5;1;Boland to Samuels, 1 run the attempted run down to third man is intercepted by the point fielder;
15.4;?;Boland to Samuels, no run appeal for caught behind, but umpire Gregory Brathwaite is unmoved. Samuels' feet are glued to the crease as he attempts to punch off the backfoot. Has a go at it but looks like it missed everything. Matthew Wade's reaction was a giveaway of sorts. He wasn't convinced there was an edge there. Smith went for the review straightaway, but as it turns out, there isn't much to overturn the initial decision of 'not out';
15.3;?;Boland to Samuels, no run floats one back in from wide of the crease, Samuels is hit high on the pad as he misses the across-the-line whip;
15.2;?;Boland to Samuels, no run play and a miss. This one holds its line after pitching at length on off stump, Samuels is squared up as the ball misses the bails by a whisker;

14.6;?;Faulkner to Ramdin, no run cuts, but straight to Maxwell at point;
14.5;?;Faulkner to Ramdin, no run punched to short cover, Bailey the man there. Once again the ball stops on him a touch as he looks to force that through the gap;

14.3;1;Faulkner to Samuels, 1 run tucks the length ball on middle and leg to fine leg;
14.2;1;Faulkner to Ramdin, 1 run nudged off the pad to fine leg. Hazlewood fires a throw to the keeper, who inturn has a shy at the stumps at the bowler's end even as Ramdin desperately tries to hustle back after being refused the second by Marlon;
14.1;?;Faulkner to Ramdin, no run fuller in length, on middle, played back with a straight bat;
13.6;?;Hazlewood to Samuels, no run slow and full on middle, dabbed to the off side;

13.4;?;Hazlewood to Samuels, no run uppish, but safe. Looks to hit it down the ground over the bowler's head, but the ball stops on him a touch to lob off the top half of the bat. Lands short of mid-on;
13.3;?;Hazlewood to Samuels, no run shapes to pull but was through with the stroke when the ball rolled off the toe-end to mid-on. Clearly early into the stroke there, but it was there to be hit;

13.1;?;Hazlewood to Samuels, no run full ball on off stump, steered to gully;

12.4;1;Faulkner to Samuels, 1 run enough width for him to make some room and crunch that off the frontfoot to sweeper cover;
12.3;?;Faulkner to Samuels, no run lazy elegance to the fore, gets half-forward to ease that to cover;
12.2;4;Faulkner to Samuels, FOUR runs the heaven or hell approach from Samuels, no half-measures as he looks to clobber that over cover, but ends up getting a thick inside edge that races past Hazlewood at midwicket. Has enough legs to race into the boundary;
12.1;?;Faulkner to Samuels, no run length ball on middle, Samuels gets back to punch that to cover;
11.6;?;Hazlewood to Ramdin, no run getting too predictable, and that's his USP, isn't it? Another full ball on off stump that's left alone by Ramdin;
11.5;?;Hazlewood to Ramdin, no run gets behind the line of the ball to bunt that to the off side;
11.4;?;Hazlewood to Ramdin, no run fantastic delivery again, draws him forward by floating it full on off stump, enough movement to create a doubt in the batsman's mind, watched through to the keeper;

10.2;4;Faulkner to Samuels, FOUR runs width on offer and he's crunched that off the backfoot into the point boundary. Delightful timing, got on top of the bounce and boom!;

7.6;?;Hazlewood to Samuels, no run bounce again! Wry smile from the bowler. Lifting ball outside off, not even close to full for the drive. Poor shot selection. Beaten;

7.3;?;Hazlewood to Samuels, no run Hazlewood welcomes Samuels with a good bouncer, he sways his upper body out of the way;
7.2;W;Hazlewood to Bravo, OUT Bravo now nicks off. What an emphatic riposte. What a catch from Steven Smith at wide-ish slip. The extra bounce undid Bravo. The line is around off.

 Innings Start
8.30pm Australia are through to the final, while West Indies v South Africa on Thursday will be a do-or-die clash. This clash was right in the balance when Australia lost their openers, but the Smith-Marsh stand set things up nicely for Glenn Maxwell to redeem himself in some style. All of that reduced a Marlon Samuels special to second-best on the night. West Indies also weren't helped by the unavailability of Holder for most parts of their bowling innings, which meant they had to mix and match with the fifth bowler's quota. A competitive game nonetheless.
Steven Smith: I thought West Indies played a pretty good game. 280 was par. They fought back well after being reduced to 3 for 30. Samuels and Ramdin's stand was a good one, but I thought we pulled it back well. We didn't hit our areas as well as we would have liked. We started well, but the middle overs weren't good. Hopefully we can do that on Sunday. It was going to be a tough chase, but the wicket played well. Mitchell Marsh played a mature innings, while Maxwell finished it off with his trademark reverse slogs. We like playing good, hard cricket as long as we cross the line.
Jason Holder: We were confident at the halfway mark. Credit to Marlon Samuels for the way he played. His partnership with Denesh Ramdin set things up for us. I strained my left hamstring, hopefully I will be ready for the next game. I'm still not sure though. We felt we were in the game right till the end. I thought Fletcher slipped in three tight overs. In hindsight, maybe he could have bowled two more. We created a few chances, which didn't go our way today. It's important to regroup going into our last game. South Africa aren't No. 2 for nothing. They've done well so far.
Marlon Samuels is the Man of the Match, again: We spoke about big partnerships during team meetings; satisfying hundred (against all ICC Full Members). I get fired up when people say things to me. Nevertheless, need to step up against South Africa on Friday. I have a few friends there (laughs).
That is all we have for you. Thanks for tuning in. Goodbye and cheers. Ciao on Friday.

47.4;1;Narine to Maxwell, 1 run swipes that across the line, to deep midwicket;
47.3;4;Narine to Maxwell, FOUR runs fired into the pads, and Maxwell has swept that into the fine leg boundary. Quickly gets down on one knee and uses the pace to help it into the boundary;
47.2;2;Narine to Maxwell, 2 runs walks across the stumps and whips it into the gap at wide long-on, called for two immediately;
47.1;1;Narine to Marsh, 1 run bunted down to long-on for an easy single;
46.6;4;Brathwaite to Maxwell, FOUR runs this time the back-blade hit from Maxwell, or is it? Too short and angling in, he changes the grip helps that past short third man. Is he back? I dare say yes. Surely this over has all but sealed it for Australia.;
46.5;6;Brathwaite to Maxwell, SIX runs this time he brings out the cross-batted swipe over deep midwicket. This was too full and he picked the bones out of that one. Darren Bravo leaps high to stop that, but can only get his finger tips to that. At no stage was he in control;
46.4;4;Brathwaite to Maxwell, FOUR runs misfield by Samuels at cover, and it has cost them a boundary. Drills a yorker-length delivery, Samuels lets it though his legs. Elementary stuff. Got up a little too early;
46.3;1;Brathwaite to Marsh, 1 run eased between cover and point, sensible stuff;
46.2;1;Brathwaite to Maxwell, 1 run slower one on middle, nudged to short fine leg;

45.5;1;Narine to Maxwell, 1 run worked behind square on the leg side for an easy single;
45.4;6;Narine to Maxwell, SIX runs is that the six that changes his fortunes? Maxwell at his destructive best. This time he brings out the switch hit and slaps it over deep point. Off the middle of the bat. That's the first boundary Narine has conceded today;

45.1;1;Narine to Marsh, 1 run leg-cutter on off stump, worked across the line to long-on;
44.6;2;Gabriel to Maxwell, 2 runs through the inner ring, squeezed between cover and point, they're back for the second;
44.5;4;Gabriel to Maxwell, FOUR runs solid connection, one bounce into the long-off boundary. Those strong forearms to the fore! Gabriel looks for the blockhole but misses his length by an inch, if not more, and it's enough for the batsman to get underneath the length.;
44.4;?;Gabriel to Maxwell, no run sees the batsman trying to make room and bowls it full and wide, Maxwell can't reach out. The ball was well inside the wide line. Smart bowling;
44.3;?;Gabriel to Maxwell, no run excellent comeback, yorker-length ball a 145 clicks, Maxwell was through with the swing even before the ball got to him;
44.2;4;Gabriel to Maxwell, FOUR runs backs away and smacks that over cover, one bounce into the boundary. This was too full, and he made sure he got underneath the length to pick the boundary. Mid-off was up, and that perhaps gave him the confidence to play that stroke;
44.1;1b;Gabriel to Marsh, 1 bye pulls and misses, Ramdin half-stops it but ensures the pace is taken off the ball, Ashley Nurse, filling in for Holder, stops that at short fine leg;
43.6;1;Narine to Marsh, 1 run flat-bats a pull to long-on, excellent over again from Narine;
43.5;?;Narine to Marsh, no run this one's a cleverly-disguised leg-cutter, which Marsh defends;

43.3;1;Narine to Maxwell, 1 run not there to cut, but he somehow manages to squeeze that full delivery past cover for a single;
43.2;?;Narine to Maxwell, no run plays a premeditated reverse sweep, but finds short third man. Not in control, you have to say;
43.2;1w;Narine to Maxwell, 1 wide quicker one on middle and leg, but it was sliding down leg, Ramdin collects cleanly. Wide called;
43.1;2b;Narine to Maxwell, 2 byes this one cuts back in sharply to sneak through the big gap between Maxwell's bat and pad as he shapes to cut. He thought the ball would spin the other way. It beat the keeper too, as it trickled towards fine leg;
42.6;?;Gabriel to Marsh, no run low full toss outside off, finds the cover fielder. Just four of the over, pressure building;
42.5;1;Gabriel to Maxwell, 1 run another yorker-length delivery on middle, bunted to long-on;

42.1;1;Gabriel to Marsh, 1 run helped towards fine leg, wrong line there, he was sliding the length ball into the pads;
41.6;?;Benn to Maxwell, no run beaten by square turn. This one drifts in, and then rips away from the rough to beat Maxwell comprehensively;
41.5;1;Benn to Marsh, 1 run flicks the low full toss to long-on again;
41.4;W;Benn to Marsh, 1 run, OUT that's the wicket West Indies were longing for. Smith doesn't even wait to see what the third umpire has to offer. It was a full toss which Marsh whipped to wide long-on. A second didn't look on but they decided to chance their luck, and unfortunately it didn't work this time. Darren Bravo fired the throw at the bowler' end on the bounce, and Benn collected that cleanly before swiftly dislodging the bails to beat Smith's desperate full-length dive. Is that the breakthrough that turns it around for West Indies? The game is back in the balance;Steven Smith run out (Bravo/Benn) 78 (145m 107b 5x4 0x6) SR: 72.89;
41.3;?;Benn to Marsh, no run hammered, but straight back to the bowler;

40.3;1lb;Brathwaite to Marsh, 1 leg bye stifled lbw appeal as Marsh looks to work across the line, the ball deflects off the pad to third man. There was appreciable bounce there, and so the ball would have comfortably missed the stumps;
40.2;2;Brathwaite to Marsh, 2 runs picks the length early and pulls in front of square, didn't entirely get hold of it, wide long-on runs around to cut that off;
40.1;1;Brathwaite to Smith, 1 run slower delivery on the stumps from wide of the crease, squeezed to short third man where Narine effects a tumbling stop;

So the bowling change has worked for the hosts!;Aaron Finch c Samuels b Brathwaite 16 (20m 11b 3x4 0x6) SR: 145.45;

2.1;4;Holder to Finch, FOUR runs plays the upper cut with ease. Sitting up nicely for him to free his arms and throw the kitchen sink at that, Finch does just that. One bounce into the ropes at deep point;

1.5;?;Gabriel to Khawaja, no run hops back to turn the short ball on middle to midwicket;

1.2;?;Gabriel to Khawaja, no run much better. Not much room to work that length ball angling away, tapped back down the pitch;

5.15pm Welcome back. Plunkett just hit a last-ball six to force a tie for England against Sri Lanka in Nottingham. Will we have a thriller here at Bridgetown? Australia, remember, go home if they lose this. Everything to play for. Aaron Finch and Usman Khawaj are the two openers. Shadows are starting to lengthen. Jason Holder with the new ball.
