 Innings Start
Australia go 5-1 up in the series with a nailbiting two-wicket win with four balls to spare. After all the flak he's received, it was Michael Clarke who held Australia's chase together with a well-paced knock that ensured that the earlier efforts of Watson, Johnson and Ferguson did not go in vain. There were contributions from all of Australia's batsmen, White and Hussey chipping in too.
But spare a thought for Jonathan Trott - a career-best effort from him to set up what could so easily have been a match-winning total. Strauss and Bell also showed they're in good nick. A thrilling end to the game that showed that there's still life and passion in this series - although, worryingly, injury lists for both teams continue to grow.
Andrew McGlashan's bulletin will be up presently - no doubt after a couple of frantic re-writes after that close finish.
A bittersweet victory, Andrew Strauss is asked. "Yeah just bitter I think, if I'm honest," he says. "It was great to see Trott play so well, all the same. 333 is a good score on any ground. We weren't helped by Collingwood's injury, and it was very disappointing not to be able to defend 333. Collingwood is ok, he had a back spasm." Team balance? "Five bowlers aren't enough when one of them goes down, that's for sure. We'll have to think about team balance at the world cup. We're 5-1 down, that's the way the game goes sometimes. If you've got seven matches it gives one side a great opportunity to gain momentum and get on top of the other. I'm still confident we've got a great side, we had a great Ashes series and no-one can take that away from us. This series hasn't really helped us nail down our World Cup XI as there've been so many injuries, but it's the same for Australia."
"Nice to get a hundred," says Jonathan Trott. "It's more memorable when you win the game. We would've taken 333 at the beginning of the day. It's good to be able to continue doing well for the team. I'm not looking to stand still, I'm looking to improve all the time."
"We're winning, first and foremost, and it's nice to be contributing with the bat," says a smiling Michael Clarke. "We had to take a few risks, I punted a bit on sending Mitch up the order and he played really well. He strikes the ball as clean as anyone. A few things didn't go to plan with the ball for us, but we're stoked to have chased those runs down. The boys are a bit weary, a bit tired, but we've got some tough cricket to come. My family and friends were out to support me today, I love playing at the SCG and it was nice to get some support today."

49.2;4;Woakes to Hastings, FOUR runs there it is! The runs count no matter how you get them, Hastings swings and a thick inside edge rolls down to the fine leg boundary. The Duke has done it for Australia at the death;
49.1;1;Woakes to Lee, 1 run full and fast, Lee drives and a thick outside edge flies down to third man ... just the single;
49.1;1w;Woakes to Lee, 1 wide not the best start, he's slammed that down halfway down and that's ballooned way, way over the batsman's head;
48.6;1;Finn to Lee, 1 run rising towards the hip, Lee doesn't know too much about it as the ball takes the thigh pad and lobs up in the air towards square leg ... eventually Hastings calls him through;
48.5;W;Finn to Clarke, 1 run, OUT slower-ball bouncer, Clarke aims a well-controlled paddle-pull into the deep. They push hard for the second ... but he's short of his ground! Clarke is run out and Australia are eight wickets down;Michael Clarke run out (Trott/?Prior) 82 (115m 70b 4x4 1x6) SR: 117.14;
48.4;3;Finn to Hastings, 3 runs that's in the air ... but safe! Hastings heaved a length delivery high into the leg side, two fielders chased after it but their tag-team effort goes slightly awry and they're back for three;
48.3;?;Finn to Hastings, no run smell that! A well-directed bouncer from Finn and Hastings is in no position to play it. The ball bursts past his grille. That's one for the over;
48.2;1;Finn to Clarke, 1 run leading edge as Clarke looks to work to leg, into the covers and they steal a quick single;
48.1;4;Finn to Clarke, FOUR runs dropped by Trott at short fine leg! He'd had such a good day until this moment, Clarke walked across to off and flicked uppishly, the ball flew in the air and Trott leapt but just tipped it over the bar - getting a hand to it but he just couldn't hold on. And he took such a good catch in that position earlier!;
47.6;?;Anderson to Hastings, no run feisty short ball from Anderson to finish his spell, Hastings hops but keeps his bat inside the line;
47.5;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run driven with plenty of wrist and bottom hand, down to long-on;
47.4;W;Anderson to Smith, OUT the disaster that was waiting to happen! Clipped straight to a sliding midwicket fielder, Australian batsmen running all over the place and Haddin is well short of his ground as the throw comes in to Anderson. He and Smith trudge off, heads bowed;Steven Smith run out (Finn/Anderson) 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
47.3;?;Anderson to Smith, no run defended to cover point;
47.2;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run a touch of wobble in through the air, Smith drives down the ground ... they think about the two, but no, it'll just be one;
47.1;2;Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs leg-stump full-toss, Clarke could've made more of that. He picks up the single out to long leg;
46.6;W;Finn to Hussey, OUT got him! Finn strikes, after beating the outside edge a couple of times he sends down another slower cutter on a length and this time the ball kisses the edge of Hussey's flailing bat. Straight through to Prior, the celebrations are very muted indeed but that's given England a chance;David Hussey c ?Prior b Finn 38 (59m 36b 2x4 1x6) SR: 105.55;
46.5;1;Finn to Clarke, 1 run full pace on the delivery, but now it's a full toss and Clarke slaps him down the ground;
46.5;1w;Finn to Clarke, 1 wide that won't please him, though. Finn aims for a slower-ball bouncer but it's misdirected down the leg side;
46.4;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Finn continues to impress, hitting a great length and beating the outside edge of Clarke's bat now;
46.3;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run Hussey backs away this time, the ball takes the inside edge and bounces straight to Trott at short fine leg, but they're off for the single straight away;
46.2;?;Finn to Hussey, no run Finn keeps his cool as Hussey charges him, going slightly wider and beating his outside edge;
46.1;1;Finn to Clarke, 1 run low, dipping full-toss and Clarke pushes down to long-on;

45.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run full, Hussey swings but he can't put it away;
45.3;6;Anderson to Hussey, SIX runs Hussey brings up Australia's 300 with a big six over long-off! Superb hitting, he stepped down the track, taking it on the half volley, and committed himself fully to the stroke. An 88 metre hit;
45.2;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run this would've been a good reverse-swinging yorker had Clarke stayed put in the crease, but he walks down to turn it into a full toss and clips to leg;
45.1;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run Hussey swings slightly wildly to leg, the ball takes the inside edge/toe of the bat and trickles to long-on;
44.6;?;Woakes to Clarke, no run the ball flies between batsman and stumps as Clarke backs a good three feet away to leg and Woakes follows him. The batsman swishes and misses, the ball zips through to the keeper. Dot ball;
44.5;2;Woakes to Clarke, 2 runs nicely whipped out into the deep on the leg side, Clarke called for two straight away. Great running;
44.4;1;Woakes to Hussey, 1 run Hussey drives down to that man at long-on this time;
44.3;1;Woakes to Clarke, 1 run Clarke backs away to leg, giving himself acres of room, but just one run the result as he drills it down to long-on;
44.2;1;Woakes to Hussey, 1 run full on off stump, dug out to mid-off - who is on the edge of the circle - and they take one;
44.1;4;Woakes to Hussey, FOUR runs chipped over cover, and that bounces away for four! The bowler had done really well, sending down a great slower ball that completely deceived the batsman. But Hussey went through with the shot, found space and on a quick outfield the ball couldn't be hauled in;
44.1;1w;Woakes to Hussey, 1 wide speared down the leg side to start, Prior appeals but is that just to try and hoodwink the umpire into not calling a wide? He's called wide, but Prior runs in and speaks to Strauss ... and they're going to review it! Nope, nothing to suggest that's hit either bat or pad. England out of reviews now;
43.6;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run good finish to the over, Anderson sends down a pinpoint yorker. Hussey jams down on it and they pick up just one as the ball rolls into the leg side and the bowler sprints after it himself;
43.5;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run Clarke walks across to the off side as Anderson sends down a slower offcutter, whipping out to deep midwicket;
43.5;1w;Anderson to Clarke, 1 wide Anderson is slightly spooked here, he aims for the yorker but sends it down the leg side;
43.4;2;Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs two more, this over's had good shots and some equally good running. Driven down to long-on, they turn immediately for the second - no hesitation - and he's easily home;
43.3;4;Anderson to Clarke, FOUR runs four more, stroked through the covers! Clarke walked down the track, Anderson went wider but the batsman was right to the pitch and picked the gap in the off side field. Damaging for England!;
43.2;2;Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs driven down the ground;
43.1;6;Anderson to Clarke, SIX runs shot! Clarke can really hit them when he wants to. This was not a slog by any means, or if it was it was a graceful one. Anderson strayed onto the pads, Clarke got insde the line and just lifted it over square leg. The ball never got up too high but it was easily six. Short boundary out there, 67 metres;
42.6;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run pushed into the off side for one, and that ends a good day with the ball for Yardy;
42.5;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run confusion! It was clipped to leg, the one was always on but there was no communication from the batsmen as they looked for the second. No harm done though;
42.4;?;Yardy to Hussey, no run tapped into the leg side, just the one;
42.3;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run tapped down the ground, and there's Clarke's fifty;
42.2;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run quicker ball from Yardy, practically medium pace and Hussey nudges him between square leg and fine leg for a quick single;
42.1;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run and he's in action straight away, driven down the ground;
41.6;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run cracked away off the back foot for one, into the off side;
41.5;3;Anderson to Hussey, 3 runs more reverse for Anderson, Hussey steps back and goes over the cover field ... but yet again Morgan is on hand with some tireless fielding on the boundary to save two runs. Good stuff;
41.4;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run reverse-swing! Definite movement through the air, out of nowhere, and it's quite exaggerated. A bit of inside edge on the clip to leg and they get one;
41.3;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run Clarke jumps down the track but can't get it away, Anderson fields in his follow-through;
41.2;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run Hussey now working the ball away from one;
41.1;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run back of a length, tapped out into the off side;
40.6;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run cut off middle stump! A brave shot for just one run;
40.5;?;Yardy to Clarke, no run a touch fuller, and quick too, but short enough that Clarke decides to play off the back foot. Straight to cover;
40.4;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run dragged down short and fast, Hussey pulls along the ground and out to the fielder in the deep;
40.3;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run again not quite full enough, Clarke hops back and cuts out to deep cover;
40.2;2;Yardy to Clarke, 2 runs short from Yardy again, but once more Clarke can't make the most of it. He gets a good connection on the pull out to midwicket, but can't find the gap;
40.1;2;Yardy to Clarke, 2 runs just a touch too short from Yardy, Clarke steps back and aims a good-looking back-foot punch out to the cover boundary, but Morgan sprints round to cut it off;
39.6;1;Finn to Clarke, 1 run Finn hits the deck hard but Clarke deals with the extra bounce well, getting on top of the ball to pick up one behind point. There's Australia's 250;
39.5;2;Finn to Clarke, 2 runs Clarke rides the bounce to send the ball down to third man ... he call's for the second and comes charging back, good running in the end as he was safely home;
39.4;?;Finn to Clarke, no run full, Clarke makes room but can't get it away;
39.3;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run a nervous shot, and some frenetic running! Hussey drove in the air, the ball dipping and dropping just short of mid-off. They also took off for a single that never was, and had the throw been better Hussey could've been run out too;
39.2;?;Finn to Hussey, no run Hussey is struggling slightly with the extra bounce, again Finn bends his back to beat the edge of an attempted glide to third man;
39.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run Hussey gives himself some room and tries to force through the off side;
38.6;1;Woakes to Hussey, 1 run another slower ball, clipped to fine leg;
38.5;?;Woakes to Hussey, no run this time it's an excellent piece of fielding that keeps the batsmen quiet, Anderson leaping like a salmon at point to stop a powerful cut;
38.4;?;Woakes to Hussey, no run effort ball from Woakes, a touch of movement and bounce and Hussey is beaten;
38.3;1;Woakes to Clarke, 1 run driven to mid-off, they take the single;
38.2;2;Woakes to Clarke, 2 runs this looked like a slower ball, hammered out into the deep on the leg side;
38.1;1;Woakes to Hussey, 1 run quick single to start the over;
37.6;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Finn has been England's most impressive bowler today and he continues to look dangerous. This time he beats the inside edge of the bat with a touch of seam movement and some flat-footed prodding from Clarke;
37.6;1w;Finn to Clarke, 1 wide Finn attacks the body as Clarke shuffles to off, and he's called wide. Fair enough, good call;
37.5;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run this time he plays for the extra bounce, staying deep and standing tall to run it down to third man;
37.4;?;Finn to Hussey, no run effort ball from Finn, and Hussey is beaten attempting to force through the off side;
37.3;1;Finn to Clarke, 1 run glanced away down to fine leg;
37.2;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run length from Finn, Hussey gives himself room and picks up one to deep cover;
37.1;1;Finn to Clarke, 1 run short, pulled hard into the leg side but there's protection out there;
36.7;1;Pietersen to Clarke, 1 run well, an extra ball to the over! What's more, it results in a single - England will be glad it's only a single;
36.6;1;Pietersen to Hussey, 1 run worked beind square on the leg side;
36.5;?;Pietersen to Hussey, no run driven back hard to the bowler;
36.4;1;Pietersen to Clarke, 1 run short again, not punished quite as severely this time as Clarke picks up one to cover point;
36.3;4;Pietersen to Clarke, FOUR runs but that definitel isn't good bowling, short - a long-hop - and Clarke steps back to pull to midwicket, the ball pinging out of the middle and evading the fielders;
36.2;?;Pietersen to Clarke, no run KP holds this one back as Clarke advances down the track, good bowling;
36.2;1w;Pietersen to Clarke, 1 wide speared down the leg side this time, that's wide;
36.1;1;Pietersen to Hussey, 1 run not much flight, but some grip and turn for Pietersen. Punched down to long-on;
35.6;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run slower ball from Finn, a cutter, and this time a single is the result as the ball is placed in gently into the gap at cover;
35.5;?;Finn to Hussey, no run pushed into the off side this time, again he hits the field;
35.4;?;Finn to Hussey, no run tapped to mid-on, there's no run there;
35.3;2;Finn to Hussey, 2 runs Hussey is off the mark, swiping out into the leg side. Morgan does well once again, sprinting round and saving two runs;
35.2;?;Finn to Hussey, no run again Finn tastes the dirt, tumbling over after he lets the ball go. It's a good delivery to receive first ball, rising and wrapping him on the glove;
35.1;W;Finn to White, OUT he picks up a wicket first ball, the dangerous White departs! It was short and rising to about neck height, White swivelled into pull but couldn't control the shot and the ball lands in Eoin Morgan's hands out at deep square leg. He barely had to move there. Finn, who tumbled over in his follow-through as he does so often, stood up just in time to see the catch taken;Cameron White c Morgan b Finn 20 (20m 21b 1x4 1x6) SR: 95.23;
34.6;2;Woakes to Clarke, 2 runs again worked off the hip by Clarke, the placement is good so they're back for the second;
34.5;1;Woakes to White, 1 run tapped into the covers, an easy one;
34.4;?;Woakes to White, no run water-tight defence to follow that up. Not something you'd usually associate with Cameron White, but he looked utterly solid as he propped forward;
34.3;4;Woakes to White, FOUR runs thrashed! An atrocious ball from Woakes, short and wide and just begging to be hit. White was camped on the front foot but he had all the time he needed to scythe through the line and send the ball screaming to the cover boundary;
34.2;?;Woakes to White, no run fuller this time, but nicely straight again. White is upset with himself for not making more of that, but it was a decent delivery;
34.1;1;Woakes to Clarke, 1 run back of a length and rising, Clarke gets nicely across and tucks off his hip out to deep square leg;
33.6;?;Pietersen to White, no run flat on off stump to finish, the ball squirts off the outer half of the bat and goes to point;
33.5;?;Pietersen to White, no run huge appeal for caught behind, Harper says no, and they'll review this ... Well, upon replay it doesn't look like he's got anywhere near that. Nothing on HotSpot. Yep, not out is the call;
33.4;6;Pietersen to White, SIX runs a rifling mow flies into the crowd at wide long-on! The ball falls right into a crowded section of the ground, leaving one female spectator with a startled look on her face. No harm done though;
33.3;?;Pietersen to White, no run flatter from KP, pushed back to the bowler;
33.2;2;Pietersen to White, 2 runs good placement from White, the ball was short and quite wide and he picked out the gap behind square. Good ground fielding out in the deep keeps them to two, however;
33.1;1;Pietersen to Clarke, 1 run good use of the feet from Clarke, as we've come to expect from him. He gets nicely to the pitch and cracks the ball down the ground for one;
32.6;?;Woakes to White, no run on a length and straight, White aims a defensive push to mid-on;
32.5;1;Woakes to Clarke, 1 run tapped away on the off side this time, these two keeping things ticking over nicely;
32.4;2;Woakes to Clarke, 2 runs well, a better throw and that could well have been out! Clarke clipped out to long leg and turned quickly for the second, Trott rifled in the throw but it came to Prior with an awkward bounce;
32.3;1;Woakes to White, 1 run drop-and-run from White, good awareness from both batsmen;
32.2;1;Woakes to Clarke, 1 run Clarke follows White's example, in his own way - pulling all along the ground out to the same fielder;
32.1;1;Woakes to White, 1 run a meaty pull to start proceedings, the ball flies in the air but well short of the men out on the leg boundary;
31.6;1;Pietersen to White, 1 run clipped through leg again;
31.5;?;Pietersen to White, no run defended back down the pitch;
31.4;2;Pietersen to White, 2 runs punched through cover for some runs;
31.3;?;Pietersen to White, no run is that dropped? Possibly a thin edge there as he pushes outside off and Prior can't glove it. Hard to tell if there was bat on that, but by the reaction of the England players, perhaps.;
31.2;1;Pietersen to Clarke, 1 run tossed up outside off and Clarke looks for the slog sweep, but just gets it along the ground through midwicket;
31.1;1;Pietersen to White, 1 run White nudges a single away to the off side;
30.6;?;Woakes to Clarke, no run nudged away to the off side and Clarke can't find a gap;
30.5;?;Woakes to Clarke, no run flicked to leg, and Clarke can't find a gap;
30.4;?;Woakes to Clarke, no run slower ball now and Clarke pushes to backward point;
30.3;1;Woakes to White, 1 run driven uppishly through cover point to get White off the mark;
30.2;?;Woakes to White, no run a big shout of 'no, no!' from White as he pushes to cover, where Pietersen collects and then gingerly hops around a bit;
30.1;1;Woakes to Clarke, 1 run late cut from Clarke, who gets a single to third man;
29.6;?;Pietersen to White, no run White defends his first ball as Pietersen gets one to turn in to the batsman;
29.5;W;Pietersen to Johnson, OUT this time Johnson is gone! Pietersen makes the breakthrough, giving it some air and pushing it well wide of off, Johnson was down the pitch again, but couldn't connect, and Prior whips the bails off;Mitchell Johnson st ?Prior b Pietersen 57 (73m 59b 1x4 2x6) SR: 96.61;
29.4;2;Pietersen to Johnson, 2 runs Johnson's eyes light up now, not surprisingly, as he advances and lofts high over mid-off, trying to clear the rope. He doesn't connect properly, and it lobs safely short of long-off;
29.3;?;Pietersen to Johnson, no run tossed up outside off, Johnson defends;
29.2;1;Pietersen to Clarke, 1 run Clarke uses the feet now and drives to long-on;
29.1;?;Pietersen to Clarke, no run clipped to midwicket and can't find a gap;
28.6;2;Anderson to Johnson, 2 runs very well played as Johnson drives straight back past the bowler and long-on and long-off converge to cut off the boundary;
28.5;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run good ball, that's fullish and straight, and Johnson keeps it out;
28.4;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run Johnson goes for the backswing as if he's thinking big, and then checks it and defends;
28.3;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run a very sharp single as Clarke pushes to backward point, Johnson was just quick enough to make it, although the throw missed in any case;
28.2;2;Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs Clarke has gone for the aerial pull off the front foot now and skies it off the top edge, but this lands safely halfway to the rope and he gets two runs;
28.1;1;Anderson to Johnson, 1 run cleverly chipped through midwicket as Johnson just waits on this ball and turns it wide of the fielder;
27.6;1;Yardy to Johnson, 1 run Johnson clips through midwicket and they want to turn this into two, but Johnson has slipped during the turn;
27.5;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run cut through cover for another one;
27.4;1;Yardy to Johnson, 1 run Johnson uses the feet now, but just gets a single from his lofted drive to deep wide mid-on;
27.3;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run Clarke is happy to keep the singles ticking over, with another drive to long-off;
27.2;1;Yardy to Johnson, 1 run there's the half-century for Johnson, his second in ODIs, and it comes with a single clipped through square leg;
27.1;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run driven down to long-on for another single;
26.6;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run pushes this one through wide mid-on for a single;
26.5;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run oooh, almost another mix-up as Clarke drives and wants a single to mid-off but then decides against it, just in time;
26.4;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run slower delivery from Anderson, and Clarke defends;
26.3;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run Clarke walks down the pitch a little and defends;
26.2;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run driven down to mid-on;
26.1;4;Anderson to Clarke, FOUR runs a boundary to begin with as Anderson strays on to the pads, and Clarke glances fine, well played to get his first boundary;
25.6;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run nudged to leg and Johnson can't quite find his fifty yet;
25.5;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run leans forward to this one and it gets him on the pad;
25.4;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run defended away to the off side;
25.3;2;Yardy to Johnson, 2 runs quick again, and Johnson clips through midwicket for a pretty comfortable two;
25.2;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run Yardy flights it more for Clarke, who uses his feet and pushes a single to long-on;
25.1;1;Yardy to Johnson, 1 run quick, flat ball from Yardy - surprise, surprise - and Johnson punches a single to long-on;
24.6;1;Trott to Johnson, 1 run fullish and straight, Johnson checks his drive and gets a single through leg;
24.5;1;Trott to Clarke, 1 run Clarke goes for the pull over midwicket now, and the man in the deep does the fielding;
24.4;?;Trott to Clarke, no run slower ball now and Clarke drives to cover;
24.3;1;Trott to Johnson, 1 run Johnson glides this one away and Finn at short third man dives across to save a boundary;

23.6;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run Johnson pushes another one defensively back to Yardy;
23.5;W;Yardy to Johnson, OUT oh dear, Ferguson and Johnson had done so well but they've really messed this up. Johnson tried to slog sweep, it lobbed off his pad out to the leg side and Ferguson toook off for a single that Mitch wasn't ready for, Ferguson turns back but has no hope of beating the throw from Prior to Yardy;Callum Ferguson run out (?Prior/Yardy) 46 (68m 44b 3x4 0x6) SR: 104.54;
23.4;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run another dot as Johnson flicks to midwicket, the quicker balls are hard to get away;
23.3;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run Johnson turns another one into a yorker by advancing, can only clip to leg;
23.2;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run Johnson uses his feet but Yardy spears it in, and the ball is pushed back to him;
23.1;1;Yardy to Ferguson, 1 run a well-timed sweep from Ferguson, but straight to the man at deep midwicket;
22.6;6;Trott to Johnson, SIX runs Johnson goes for it and just clear the rope! He's decided to go after Trott and lifted him over midwicket, there's a man back on the boundary, it's Woakes, and he wasn't far off being able to reach it, but couldn't quite make it. In fact, on second inspection, it may have flicked his fingers on the way through. Half a chance, perhaps.;
22.5;?;Trott to Johnson, no run slower and fuller, Johnson clips to midwicket;
22.4;2;Trott to Johnson, 2 runs Johnson flicks this one through square leg and it's collected in the deep;
22.3;1;Trott to Ferguson, 1 run slower ball from Trott - which is to say, even slower - and Ferguson flicks it through square leg;
22.2;4;Trott to Ferguson, FOUR runs another boundary for Ferguson, as he backs off and crunches Trott over cover, clearing the man safely enough and there is nobody in the deep;
22.1;?;Trott to Ferguson, no run Ferguson tries to drive through cover but can't find the gap;
21.6;1;Woakes to Ferguson, 1 run square-driven now through point;
21.5;4;Woakes to Ferguson, FOUR runs very well played by Ferguson, he's walked across just a touch to work this one from middle stump behind square leg. Fine leg is up, deep square can't get it , and that's a valuable boundary;
21.4;1;Woakes to Johnson, 1 run slower ball from Woakes and Johnson has picked it, punching it back past the bowler, the ball flicks one of those run-up marker discs and is collected by long-on;
21.3;1;Woakes to Ferguson, 1 run again Ferguson gives himself room and cuts hard through point;
21.2;2;Woakes to Ferguson, 2 runs a wristy flick from Ferguson finds him two more runs through midwicket, these two really are ticking the score along, even if the boundaries aren't flowing;
21.1;1;Woakes to Johnson, 1 run banged in short by Woakes, and Johnson pulls comfortably to deep midwicket;
20.6;1;Trott to Johnson, 1 run this one gets through mid-off but again there is a man in the deep;
20.5;2;Trott to Johnson, 2 runs a solid back-foot drive through cover now and Wright in the deep does the fielding, sliding well to save the boundary;
20.4;?;Trott to Johnson, no run on the back foot, Johnson punches a drive that can't quite beat mid-off;
20.3;1;Trott to Ferguson, 1 run Ferguson is happy to pick up the singles when they're on offer, another clip behind square leg;
20.2;1;Trott to Johnson, 1 run driven uppishly now, it bounces down towards long-on;
20.1;1;Trott to Ferguson, 1 run a lucky single to third man now as Ferguson backs off and tries to drive through cover, getting an edge through the vacant slips region;
19.6;1;Woakes to Ferguson, 1 run pushed just wide enough of cover to collect a run;
19.5;?;Woakes to Ferguson, no run tries to power this one through cover but Strauss has fielded it well;
19.4;?;Woakes to Ferguson, no run solidly defended by Ferguson;
19.3;1;Woakes to Johnson, 1 run flicks another single through the leg side now;
19.2;2;Woakes to Johnson, 2 runs a crunchy back-foot drive from Johnson flies through the air at cover, and he picks up two to the man in the deep;
19.1;1;Woakes to Ferguson, 1 run Ferguson backs off and gives himself a little room again, then punches through cover point;
18.6;2;Trott to Johnson, 2 runs on the pads now and Johnson flicks another couple of runs behind square;
18.5;1;Trott to Ferguson, 1 run Ferguson backs off a touch and pulls hard through square leg but can't find a boundary;
18.4;?;Trott to Ferguson, no run pushed away to point and can't find a gap;
18.3;1;Trott to Johnson, 1 run Johnson punches this through cover for another single;
18.2;1;Trott to Ferguson, 1 run tucked away through square leg for a single, but that's not the story here. Kevin Pietersen is the fielder and he's twisted his right ankle sliding to collect the ball, and he immediately goes down, not throwing the ball in. He looks in pain, getting some attention from the physio.;
18.1;1;Trott to Johnson, 1 run shortish to start with and Trott is perhaps lucky to get away with that, Johnson pulls a single to deep square leg;
17.6;2;Pietersen to Ferguson, 2 runs not a great ball, well wide of off, and Ferguson cuts through point;
17.5;1;Pietersen to Johnson, 1 run chipped down the ground towards long-on for a single;
17.4;2;Pietersen to Johnson, 2 runs again Johnson advances, and this one is a full toss that he drives down the ground for two more;
17.3;?;Pietersen to Johnson, no run fullish and on the pads, Johnson can't beat square leg;
17.2;2;Pietersen to Johnson, 2 runs a good, straight-bat push through extra cover now and Johnson picks up two runs;
17.1;?;Pietersen to Johnson, no run Johnson uses the feet now but turns this delivery into a yorker and can only push it back to KP;
16.6;2;Yardy to Ferguson, 2 runs drifts on to the pads of Ferguson, who clips through leg and picks up a single - ah, but the throw is messy and Prior can't collect, and that allows an overthrow;
16.5;1;Yardy to Johnson, 1 run a single only for Johnson as he pulls another quick ball down towards long on;
16.4;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run another quick one angles in to the pads and Johnson can't connect;
16.3;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run now then, what's happened here? Johnson has taken a big swing, Prior takes the bails off and then doesn't seem to bother appealing. It's almost as if he thinks Johnson has been bowled, but clearly that hasn't happened. Prior has taken the bails off with Johnson's foot completely grounded - and he's not out. Very odd.;
16.2;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run quicker - all Johnson can do is defend;
16.1;1;Yardy to Ferguson, 1 run plenty of flight here and Ferguson leans out to push a single through cover;
15.6;6;Pietersen to Johnson, SIX runs huge! It was always simply a matter of time for Johnson, especially with KP bowling. He charges down the track and heaves into the leg side, the ball comes right out of the middle and sails into the crowd;
15.5;1;Pietersen to Ferguson, 1 run floated up slower and fuller, the ball dips and grips to take a thick inside edge roll into the leg side. The fielder rushes in but he can't stop the single;
15.4;1;Pietersen to Johnson, 1 run Johnson happy to simply accept singles with the field spread at the moment, again dropping the ball into the off side and setting off;
15.3;1;Pietersen to Ferguson, 1 run spinning in and bouncing quite sharply, but Ferguson goes deep in the crease and works to leg;
15.2;?;Pietersen to Ferguson, no run flat outside off, but decent revs on the ball. Ferguson, not quite sure what to expect, defends slightly awkwardly;
15.1;1;Pietersen to Johnson, 1 run Johnson props forward and opens the face of the bat to pick up a single behind point;
14.6;2;Yardy to Ferguson, 2 runs hurled down on a leg-stump line by Yardy, Ferguson gets a little tickle on it to send the ball down towards fine leg;
14.5;1;Yardy to Johnson, 1 run slapped hard out to the man at long leg, all along the ground though;
14.4;1;Yardy to Ferguson, 1 run Ferguson is working the ball around nicely, another quick single;
14.3;1;Yardy to Johnson, 1 run another heave into the leg side, this time the ball takes a thick inside edge;
14.2;?;Yardy to Johnson, no run that's what he's in for! Johnson bends into a mighty slog-sweep, missing the ball by acres however. Big appeal from Prior as he's struck on the pad, but that was highly optimistic. HawkEye confirms missing leg;
14.1;1;Yardy to Ferguson, 1 run tapped down behind square on the off side for one;
13.6;?;Finn to Johnson, no run quiet end to the over, Johnson defends to leg;
13.5;1;Finn to Ferguson, 1 run nicely flicked off the hip by Ferguson, and they take a single as the ball rolls to square leg;
13.4;1;Finn to Johnson, 1 run quick single, drop-an-run into the covers by Johnson;
13.3;4;Finn to Johnson, FOUR runs intelligent batting from Johnson. He knew there was no-one out on the off side, Finn pitches one up and he immediately scoops up and over cover point. Strong shot;
13.2;?;Finn to Johnson, no run Johnson gets himself in position to work to leg, but a touch of seam movement means he ends up playing the ball gently back down the wicket;
13.1;?;Finn to Johnson, no run good length from Finn, zoning in on the top of off stump. Johnson defends;
12.6;?;Yardy to Ferguson, no run good finish to the over, accurate stuff from Yardy and Ferguson can't get him away;
12.5;2;Yardy to Ferguson, 2 runs speared down the leg side, the ball flicks the pad and trickles down to fine leg;
12.4;1;Yardy to Johnson, 1 run glanced down to fine leg;
12.3;1;Yardy to Ferguson, 1 run wide and much too short from Yardy, he's got protection on the cover boundary for Ferguson though;
12.2;1;Yardy to Johnson, 1 run Johnson is off the mark straight away, dropping the ball in front of point;
12.1;W;Yardy to Watson, OUT Yardy strikes! Great catch from Andrew Strauss. Another fifty-and-out for Watson, he was aiming to whip through the leg side but hit the ball in the air. Strauss, at short midwicket, leapt to his right to pluck the ball out of the air. A timely wicket for England;Shane Watson c Strauss b Yardy 51 (51m 34b 8x4 0x6) SR: 150;
11.6;4;Finn to Ferguson, FOUR runs thrashed through cover! Ferguson backs right away to give himself room as Finn goes fuller, he gets a great connection and the ball is across the boundary in a flash;
11.5;?;Finn to Ferguson, no run Finn keeping the ball relatively short, Ferguson can't get it away;
11.4;?;Finn to Ferguson, no run Ferguson doesn't look entirely convincing when the ball is rising up at his chest, this time he stands at the crease and tries to work to leg, but the ball goes nowhere;
11.3;1;Finn to Watson, 1 run straight-ish again, Watson gets across to off and nurdles to midwicket for one;
11.2;1;Finn to Ferguson, 1 run slightly too straight, worked round the corner for a quick single;
11.1;?;Finn to Ferguson, no run short of length and rising on Ferguson, who pushes to point;
10.6;1;Yardy to Ferguson, 1 run Ferguson finds some space on the off side for a quick single to keep the strike;
10.5;?;Yardy to Ferguson, no run glanced to short fine leg this time, again no run to be had;
10.4;?;Yardy to Ferguson, no run Yardy giving the batsmen no room to work with, clipped straight to square leg;
10.3;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run there's the fifty for Watto, and from just 32 balls. Driven down to long-on, and a warm ripple of applause greets the landmark;
10.2;?;Yardy to Watson, no run full, watchful defence;
10.1;1;Yardy to Ferguson, 1 run wristily worked out into the deep on the leg side;
9.6;?;Finn to Watson, no run good finish to the over, Finn hitting a good length and a nice, straight line. Watson can't get him away and will have to wait a bit longer for his 19th ODI fifty;
9.5;?;Finn to Watson, no run this one hits the seam and moves appreciably back in off the pitch. Good bounce too, taking the splice of the bat;
9.4;?;Finn to Watson, no run fuller from Finn, targeting the pads. Watson nudges to leg but a tumbling short midwicket negates any thought of a run;
9.3;?;Finn to Watson, no run Watson stays deep in the crease and defends into the off side;
9.2;1;Finn to Ferguson, 1 run forced away through gully and down to third man for one;
9.1;?;Finn to Ferguson, no run Finn hits the deck hard, Ferguson defends to backward point;
8.6;1;Yardy to Ferguson, 1 run worked to the right of the mid-on fielder, a quick single the result;
8.5;2;Yardy to Ferguson, 2 runs Ferguson is up and away, cutting nicely behind square. Some tag-team fielding on the boundary saves runs;
8.4;?;Yardy to Ferguson, no run full and straight from Yardy, solidly defended;
8.3;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run punched down to long-on;
8.2;?;Yardy to Watson, no run driven hard back to the bowler;
8.1;2;Yardy to Watson, 2 runs a hard run two to start, Watson clipping right between the two men on the leg boundary and pushing for the second. Good running;
7.6;W;Anderson to Haddin, OUT Trott is back on the field and back into action with a tremendous, diving catch at short fine leg! Leg stump half-volley from Anderson, begging to be put away and Haddin gets nicely into position to flick to fine leg. The ball goes in the air, however, and Trott goes airborne to pull off a great catch. He's still got some juice in the legs then! That'll lift England;Brad Haddin c Trott b Anderson 20 (33m 25b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80;
7.5;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run fuller, driven by Haddin. He can't find the gap in the field this time;
7.4;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run thick outside edge as Watson aims a front-foot pull into the leg side, the ball loops up ever so gently and falls short of third man. An eventful over!;
7.3;2;Anderson to Watson, 2 runs glanced down to fine leg;
7.2;2;Anderson to Watson, 2 runs another chance! Watson this time, driving much too early. The ball dips just in front of a leaping Andrew Strauss, it was a really tough chance but he could have got the fingers under that one;
7.1;3;Anderson to Haddin, 3 runs as the lacquer's come off the new ball it's just started to move around a bit more - Haddin is undone by an outswinger from Anderson, playing too early and driving in the air ... but wide of the fielder!;
6.6;4;Finn to Watson, FOUR runs Watson attacks into the leg side, lifting the ball high into the air ... Wright charges round from deep midwicket, the ball bounces safely at wide long-on and evades his despairing dive!;
6.5;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run length delivery, just outside off and now Haddin runs down to third man;
6.4;1;Finn to Watson, 1 run guided down to third man off the face of the bat;
6.3;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run brave running! Haddin punches almost straight to Anderson at mid-off and sets off, the pick-up and throw are good but not good enough - the ball goes wide and Haddin slides safely into the crease with a dive;
6.2;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin hops back and defends to cover;
6.1;1;Finn to Watson, 1 run flicked to midwicket for one;
5.6;3;Anderson to Watson, 3 runs big over for Australia, everything going Watson's way at the moment. This could so easily have ended up in the hands of the fielder, Watson is turned inside-out by another outswinger but the ball lands safely and rolls away;
5.5;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs well, that was short-lived. Watson is on the attack once more, sending the ball racing away through cover point with a crunching cut;
5.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run good comeback - eventually - from Anderson, a perfectly pitched outswinger beating the outside edge;
5.3;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs three in a row! Watson was aiming for deep midwicket but the ball takes the top edge of the bat and flies down to third man once again;
5.2;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs four more, he was aiming for the late cut but hit it rather finer than perhaps he was hoping. The edge flies just wide of an airborne Prior and away for four;
5.1;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs Watson is in dominant mood, lifting a length delivery outside off up and over cover point. Didn't bother trying to keep it down, just scythed through the line;
4.6;?;Finn to Haddin, no run good finish, keeping Haddin deep in the crease and defending;
4.5;2;Finn to Haddin, 2 runs Finn trudges nonplussed back to his mark as the ball is hit right between point and cover, bisecting both diving fielders;
4.4;?;Finn to Haddin, no run driven hard, straight to mid-off;
4.3;2;Finn to Haddin, 2 runs sloppy stuff in the field - and from James Anderson of all people. Haddin popped a drive in the air just wide of Strauss at short extra cover, Anderson charged round in the covers but as he slid to field kicked the ball further away to allow the runs;
4.2;?;Finn to Haddin, no run cracking delivery from Finn, an outswinger that hits the pitch and moves further away to beat the outside edge of Haddin's bat;
4.1;?;Finn to Haddin, no run just short of a length to start, tucked into the covers;
3.6;?;Anderson to Watson, no run these two batsmen matching each other shot for shot, now Watson is too early into a drive and inside edges back down the track...;
3.5;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run punched just wide of mid-off, and they have time to nip through for a quick single;
3.4;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin sets himself for the booming cover drive, but is perhaps too enthusiastic in the shot as the ball takes a thick inside edge and ricochets off the pad;
3.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run forced off the back foot into the off side, but straight to the fielder;
3.2;2;Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs pulled this time, not altogether convincingly however and that wasn't too far from the man in catching at short midwicket;
3.1;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin joins in, as he too is offered a short, wide gift from Anderson. The batsman accepts happily, rocking back to crack a cut in front of point;
2.6;4;Woakes to Watson, FOUR runs slap! Dismissive stroke from Watson, seizing on a short, wide delivery and crashing it away through point;
2.5;1;Woakes to Haddin, 1 run well, this one's hit the seam and left the batsman off the pitch. Haddin is totally squared up and a thick outside edge squirts behind square on the off side;
2.4;?;Woakes to Haddin, no run this time he's nicely in line and defending down the track;
2.3;?;Woakes to Haddin, no run slightly ungainly defence from Haddin, he's almost playing French cricket as he defends flat-footed into the covers;
2.2;1;Woakes to Watson, 1 run chopped wide of gully for one;
2.1;4;Woakes to Watson, FOUR runs this is a shaky start from Woakes, again he goes back of a length but speared down the leg side. Watson just gets a touch on it, sending the ball fine of the man at wide leg slip to pick up four;
1.6;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run a low, swinging full toss is worked into the leg side to end the over;
1.5;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run tapped towards mid-on, not hit with much power so there's time for them to sprint through for one;
1.4;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run good length but just a bit too straight from Anderson, and now Watson picks up a single with a nudge into the leg side;
1.3;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run a bit of wobble in to the batsman through the air, clipped gently into the leg side for one;
1.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run there is some seam movement though, as this one jags back in off the pitch. Just short of a good length, hitting the pitch hard;
1.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run interesting start, Anderson pitches it right up in the blockhole first ball. Dug out, not much swing;
0.6;?;Woakes to Watson, no run pushed to point once more, off the front foot this time;
0.5;?;Woakes to Watson, no run is that a better length with virtually no swing on offer? Woakes jams this one into the pitch to have Watson hopping back to defend to point;
0.4;1;Woakes to Haddin, 1 run Haddin's off the mark straight away, simply laying bat on one and sending the ball dribbling into the leg side. It's wide of mid-on, and so an easy single;
0.3;1;Woakes to Watson, 1 run on a decent length, but quite wide of off and Watson is in no trouble chopping down to third man;
0.2;?;Woakes to Watson, no run Watson steps confidently forward and aims a muscly drive right at mid-on;
0.2;5w;Woakes to Watson, 5 wide that's ugly, sprayed well down the leg side and Prior never had a chance;
0.1;4;Woakes to Watson, FOUR runs well, that's one way to start! Woakes searches for swing with the new ball, floating it right up outside off, but Watson simply leans forward to caress a drive to the cover boundary. Australia up and running;

Welcome back everyone, I'm Liam Brickhill and I'll be your commentator for the opening exchanges of Australia's pursuit of 334. We're all set for what should be a thrilling chase. Chris Woakes will take the new ball, and he'll be under pressure from the start on a flat deck. Shane Watson will take first strike.
