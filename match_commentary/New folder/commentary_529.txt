2.35pm. A good innings from Hauritz, his personal best, gets Australia to 445. The tail wagged, and how, after a 142-run stand between centurion Clarke and half-centurion Johnson put Australia on top. Don't go very far because South Africa will come out to bat soon.
"According to the ABC radio commentators out here at the SCG, Steyn has a badly bruised left heel. Trouble for their second innings?" says Ed McGregor.
By the way, we've assembled a selection of

91.1;1;Morkel to Clarke, 1 run strays onto the pads and he clips a single to deep midwicket;
90.6;?;Ntini to Johnson, no run pitches outside leg, shapes in, Johnson defends off the back foot;

 Innings Start
Siddle is mobbed by his team-mates. He raises the ball to the crowd and leads his team off. A great spell from him and he will cherish this moment. Australia have bowled kept South Africa to 327, thereby securing a lead of 118. Boucher played well for his 89, a career best here. We will have Australia's second innings shortly, so don't go far.

 Innings Start
Whew. Let me take a deep breath. I'm drained. Australia hold their nerves - well, let me say Johnson - to make win a consolation match. Steyn and Ntini frustrated Australia superbly, and then a brave Smith came out to bat with a broken left hand. He survived 17 balls before he was bowled. Ntini remains unbeaten on 28 from 75 balls. This Test was nerve wracking, pulsating, brilliant. The pitch was scandalous but Ntini and Steyn applied themselves brilliantly.
What a competitive series it has been. Australia are utterly enthused at winning a classic. Hats off to them. But the series winners, South Africa, are the ones who will walk off with their heads held high. They have achieved their target of beating Australia in Australia. Time to head down to the post-match ceremony.
After the 3 Mobile CEO gets done thanking the teams, captains, fans, viewers, umpires and pledges his company's sponsorship to Australia till 2013, he announces the Man of the Match. And its Peter Siddle, who took eight wickets in the match. Siddle: "Its been tough work. I'm very pleased with how I'm going. I thought there was always a chance, its funny how Test cricket works out. Its my first Test series and I need to look to the future and I cant wait for the next few matches."
Now the Man of the Series, which is Smith for his 326 runs. "Things got close and I got nervous," he says. "Once AB got out and the tail was in I decided I would go in but then the guys held out pretty well. It was great to see."
Glenn McGrath gets sentimental as he speaks of the response to the McGrath Foundation awareness program and his late wife, Jane. He thanks everyone who worked with his foundation during and before the Test. And he thanks both sides.
Ponting steps up to the stage: "I'm proud with the way we've played all series. We were in some good positions but couldn't hold on. Congrats to Mickey and Graeme, their side was behind the eight-ball on a few occasions but came back well and thats the sign of a great side. Here, the weather held off and we were able to win."
Smith comes back to accept the series trophy. The SCG cheers. "I think 2008 was an extremely successful year for us and this series was played in great spirit. Thanks to CA, the fans, and Ricky and his team. I'm really chuffed to be on the winning side for once."
Smith is joined by the rest of his squad for a photo-op with the silverware. And the bubbly is popped.
And now to you, the readers. Thank you for tuning in all series, and I hope you've enjoyed the coverage. The limited-overs leg kicks off with a Twenty20 international at Melbourne on January 11, so do come back see us. On behalf of everyone else who was involved in bringing you this Test series, this is Jamie Alter signing off. Good bye and good luck!
