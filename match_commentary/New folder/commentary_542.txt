Pakistan will fancy chasing this. Australia completely lost the plot in the middle overs, once the spinners came on. It was the combo of Afridi and Malik that did the damage, who kept the leash on Clarke and Haddin during their stand. Wickets kept falling at fairly frequent intervals, and even in the last ten, once the seamers came back on, Pakistan sustained very little damage. Join us in a bit for the run-chase.

 Innings Start
What a turnaround. Pakistan were 95 for no loss, and lost all their wickets for 76 runs. The introduction of spin sparked a change in fortunes for Pakistan, with Hauritz getting rid of Butt, and then Clarke taking two in an over.
It all went downhill from then on, as batsman after batsman either got out playing a needless shot, or was done in by some genuinely good bowling. Australia kept the pressure on as soon as they sniffed a chance at a comeback, and once they had seized the advantage, they didn't take too long to complete the formalities, despite a determined Malik at the crease.
Pakistan have a lot to introspect, and again have lived up to their reputation of being extremely erratic. Their shoddy performance with the bat, after having done very well to restrict Australia, has given Australia a potentially decisive 2-1 lead in this series. Pakistan will now have to come up with something special to pull off a comeback here. Join us in a bit for details from the presentation. No surprises about who's going to be the Man of the Match - Michael Clarke.
Younis Khan: "We lost too many wickets too quickly. This is a young team, we need to learn from Australia. They have this tendency to bounce back. "
Clarke: "Fantastic win. I thought we were about 20-30 runs short, but we bowled and fielded really well. Hauritz bowled superbly. We did well to scramble to 200, but credit to the Pakistan spinners. It was really hard to play the spinners, and we did the job tonight. It's good to make the most of wickets like these. Fielding is all about attitude, and we threw ourselves at everything tonight to pull it off."
That's all we have for today. Australia have bounced back superbly to lead the series 2-1, and Pakistan will have to emulate them to pull of a series win here. Thanks for your feedback. Until the next game on May day, it's goodbye from all of us at Cricinfo. Adios!
