5.06pm Quite a grandstand finish, but importantly Australia have finished with a very defendable 243 for 9 on this surface. Trent Boult with the headline performance right at the end, but it was Lockie Ferguson's pace that rattled Australia right up top. Colin de Grandhomme did a great job, too, and it was down to a rearguard from Alex Carey and Usman Khawaja, with a good little hand from Pat Cummins, that has lifted them to a fighting total. Still everything to play for here, surely? Al Muthu will be at the helm when we return for the New Zealand chase. Stick around till then!
49.6;?;Boult to Lyon, no run full, wide outside off, and he looks to back away to get this down to fine leg, but misses. Almost got FOUR IN FOUR!;
49.5;W;Boult to Behrendorff, OUT HE'S GOT IT! Full, swinging away from him after pitching around leg, and given. Australia have reviewed this! It's a perfect full length, and there's no sign of bat near that. The only question could be where it pitched, I would think. The bat hits ground, but that is after the ball passes through and crashes into his right foot. It's out, and that's a hat-trick for Trent Boult!;Jason Behrendorff lbw b Boult 0 (4m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
49.4;W;Boult to Starc, OUT OH YOU BEAUTY! We might get to see a bit of this from Starc later -- a perfect yorker, that swings in at good pace and goes under his blade even as he looks to jam it down. Almost as good as the ball that Starc delivered to Ben Stokes just a few days ago!;Mitchell Starc b Boult 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
49.3;W;Boult to Khawaja, OUT GONE THIS TIME! Perfect full ball again, delivered at 137kph, and with a hint of reverse again back in from outside off. Khawaja walks across to access the on side, but misses out on contact and in fact walks right outside the line of the ball. Vital half-century from Khawaja, though, as he acknowledges the crowd on his way out;Usman Khawaja b Boult 88 (187m 129b 5x4 0x6) SR: 68.21;
49.2;1;Boult to Cummins, 1 run fuller ball, around the stumps, and he can only tap it towards short midwicket;
49.1;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run low full toss, swinging back in, and he drives it down to long off. Bowled at 144kph;
48.6;4;Ferguson to Cummins, FOUR runs full toss, and this time he has pierced the infield! Backs away, and even takes the bottom hand as he muscles this through cover, and too fast for sweeper at the point fence to get to it. What a hand this is from Cummins...;
48.5;2;Ferguson to Cummins, 2 runs full toss, outside off, and he looks to drive this down the ground. Outside edge runs it down to the right of third man, and they scurry through for the second;
48.4;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run short, and he drop-kicks this, one bounce towards long leg;
48.3;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run short, and he ducks under it. Decides late to try and run it down towards third man, but that had already passed him by then;
48.2;1;Ferguson to Cummins, 1 run full, outside off, and he guides a 143kph ball towards deep point;
48.1;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run backs away to the legside and biffs a full ball down towards long on;
41.6;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run full, outside off, and he opens up the face of his blade to run it towards deep point;
41.5;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run length, and he drives on the up, but cannot beat cover;
41.4;1;Boult to Carey, 1 run fuller ball, a hint of reverse back into him, as he biffs this off the inside of the bat towards deep backward square leg;
41.3;2;Boult to Carey, 2 runs length, and he drives this past covers. Seems like a change of pace, but he picked it well. That also brings up the 100-run partnership;
41.2;?;Boult to Carey, no run length, and the ball stops on Carey as he looks to drive this down the ground. Not able to time this well at all;
41.1;?;Boult to Carey, no run length, and he drives it but cannot beat mid off;
40.6;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run was that dropped? Too full for the cut, as he backs away and looks to get it through the offside. Goes through to Latham, but no great reactions from the bowler. Seems to be have been just a bad miss;
40.5;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run goes back and drives it towards point;
40.4;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run flatter, outside off, and he swats it away towards deep midwicket;
40.3;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run leans back and cuts a length ball outside off away towards deep backward point;
40.2;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run flighted outside off, and he drives back to the bowler;
40.1;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run tossed up outside off, and he drives but cannot beat point;
47.6;2;Boult to Cummins, 2 runs short ball, and he moves away to the leg side and ramps it down towards third man. Cheeky!;
47.5;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run swings into him from a full length, and he takes it on the full and drops it down towards long leg;
47.4;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run backs away, and Boult shortens the length. Wants to go over point, but misses out on contact;
47.3;4;Boult to Khawaja, FOUR runs gets lucky! Charges down to a fuller ball again, and with the late reverse swing, it takes the inside edge and runs fine past Latham;
47.2;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run precise yorker. Swings a bit late into him, and he can only dig it out towards cover;
47.1;1;Boult to Cummins, 1 run wide outside off, and he drives this towards sweeper cover;
46.6;1;Sodhi to Cummins, 1 run length, wide outside off, and he slaps this down to long off;
46.5;2;Sodhi to Cummins, 2 runs length, and he swings this towards deep midwicket. To the right of Neesham, who nonchalantly knocks this back into play with his right hand. Superb fielding, but vital runs for Australia!;
46.4;2;Sodhi to Cummins, 2 runs tossed up outside off, and he goes for it down the ground. Takes the leading edge, and this time it lands just short of long on!;
46.3;2;Sodhi to Cummins, 2 runs length, and he goes inside out. Drops short of long off;
46.2;2;Sodhi to Cummins, 2 runs length, and he goes towards deep midwicket. Could have had four, but for Jimmy Neesham, who fields this down to his left;
46.1;?;Sodhi to Cummins, no run floats this wide outside off, and beats a swat from Cummins;
39.6;1lb;Boult to Khawaja, 1 leg bye looks to flick a fuller delivery on leg stump to fine leg. But only ends up making contact with the pad;
39.5;1;Boult to Carey, 1 run shortish and outside off, slices to the sweeper;
39.4;?;Boult to Carey, no run good length outside off, he drives to mid-off;
39.3;4;Boult to Carey, FOUR runs and now he's playing all the orthodox stuff. The picture perfect off drive. Placed to the right of Williamson. Amazing timing on a pitch that isn't suiting such shots;
39.2;?;Boult to Carey, no run nudges the length ball on middle to midwicket;
39.1;?;Boult to Carey, no run half an lbw appeal but Boult bails out of it. Would've gone down. Decent straight though. The ball on a good length and nipping into Carey, who wasn't expecting that as he plays the flick;
38.6;2;Williamson to Khawaja, 2 runs width again and Khawaja slaps it to the left of backward point;
38.5;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run shortish and outside off, he rocks back and cuts to deep point;
38.4;?;Williamson to Carey, no run;
38.3;?;Williamson to Carey, no run sweeps to midwicket;
38.2;?;Williamson to Carey, no run edged but safe. Williamson has been teasing the left-handers with a lot of flight. Drawing them into the drive outside off. Carey's sucked into the trap, gets a very thick nick, Latham follows it, staying down and getting up with the ball, but he can't grab it in the end;
38.1;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run very very full - so much that it becomes a low full toss on middle. Khawaja drives to long-off;
45.6;1;Ferguson to Cummins, 1 run fuller, outside off, and he drives this to point, and takes the single on offer;
45.5;?;Ferguson to Cummins, no run short, angles into him at 145kph and he ducks under this;
45.4;?;Ferguson to Cummins, no run slower ball, outside off, and he stays rooted in the crease and sees that beat the outside edge. Bowled at 114kph;
45.3;?;Ferguson to Cummins, no run short, and well-directed again! This was 143kph, and Cummins was caught in two minds. Wanted to come forward, and suddenly forced to duck by the angle of that sharp, incoming delivery;
45.2;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run full, fast and he drives this down to long on;
45.1;4;Ferguson to Khawaja, FOUR runs wide outside off from Ferguson, and he slashes this through point. Great shot, as he uses the 136kph on offer on that ball to get it behind square;
44.6;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run floated close to off stump, and he flicks it with the turn towards deep midwicket;
44.5;4;Sodhi to Khawaja, FOUR runs reverse lap, and does well to get it over the infield. Through the point fence, and he simply had to time it well enough;
44.4;1;Sodhi to Cummins, 1 run tossed up, with Ross Taylor at first slip, but Cummins stretches and drives this down to long off;
44.3;?;Sodhi to Cummins, no run wrong 'un, on a good length, and he defends from the crease;
44.2;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run tossed up, around the middle stump, and he whips it away towards deep midwicket;
44.1;?;Sodhi to Khawaja, no run starts with a googly, which he drives to covers;
43.6;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run drives a fuller ball towards sweeper cover;
43.5;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run short, and well directed. Forced to take evasive action for the second time in the over. Angles across his body;
43.4;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run fuller, slower (if that's possible) and angles across him. Just 122kph, and he taps it towards point;
43.3;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run short, and he ducks inside the line of this;
43.2;1;Ferguson to Cummins, 1 run length, and he pokes it down to third man. There's a slip in place for Cummins now;
43.1;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run back of a length, angles across him and he steers it down to third man;
42.6;W;Williamson to Carey, OUT OUT THIS TIME! A terrific hand from Alex Carey comes to an end, as he looks to go inside out over cover but cannot clear Martin Guptill. Smart work, too, from KW, as he continues to get some purchase and grip from this surface. Nonetheless, this partnership has brought Australia right back into this contest;Alex Carey c Guptill b Williamson 71 (113m 72b 11x4 0x6) SR: 98.61;
42.5;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run tossed up, and he flicks this with some quick wrists and fast hands towards square leg;
42.4;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run cuts this off the backfoot towards deep backward point;
42.3;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run looks for the cheeky paddle sweep, and gets it towards fine leg. Aerial, but just beyond Latham;
42.2;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run short, and he cuts it towards deep point again;
42.1;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run short, and he goes back and cuts it towards deep backward point;
37.6;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run shortish on off stump, pushes into the covers;
37.5;4;Ferguson to Carey, FOUR runs unreal! Ferguson loves bowling short. He's had success bowling short. But this is only 142 kph. And it's only above waist high. All of that essentially means it's in Carey's wheelhouse and he just stands tall and slams it over deep midwicket #LikeABoss;
37.4;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run defends a good length ball on off stump to point;
37.3;2;Ferguson to Carey, 2 runs waits on the short ball outside off and carves it behind point. Guptill is there and he gets a hand on it to parry it towards third man;
37.2;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run hangs back and pulls a short ball outside of at 145 kph to short midwicket.;
37.1;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run looks to flick a shortish ball on leg stump through square leg, but is into the shot a touch too early. And no wonder. This is only at 141 kph. Fergs bowls 150.;
36.6;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run presents the inside out drive to long-off;
36.5;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run loops it up outside off and Khawaja unleashes a flowing drive to the sweeper;
36.4;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run full on off stump, Khawaja plays a little inside the line because of KW's drift, and the turn secures the outside edge to point;
36.3;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run fullish and outside off, he plays from the crease and slices it to cover;
36.2;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run stays back to try and cut a ball that isn't quite short enough and is beaten again;
36.1;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run beats him as Khawaja once again plays too far away from his body without moving his front foot across;
35.6;1;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 run gets up with the short ball outside off and pulls it down to deep square leg. Good technique, playing it on top of the bounce and rolling the wrists to keep it down;
35.5;1;Neesham to Carey, 1 run back of a length and outside off, spears it through to the sweeper;
35.4;4;Neesham to Carey, FOUR runs streaky shot but a super cool fifty. Looks to drive a wide ball outside off through the covers but ends up with an inside edge past the keeper. Deserves that luck. He's played with a lot of skill and no shortage of punch. Made Australia's quickest World Cup fifty earlier this tournament. Following it up with another lovely little innings;
35.3;?;Neesham to Carey, no run blocks a back of a length delivery to point;
35.2;?;Neesham to Carey, no run tucks him up with a back of a length ball on middle. Defends;
35.1;4;Neesham to Carey, FOUR runs outrageous! This is an attempted bouncer outside off. So pulling it carries risk. But Carey manages it beautifully by leaping off his feet, getting on top of the ball and hammering it away through wide mid-on.;
34.6;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run backs away and cuts the shortish delivery through to the sweeper;
34.5;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run full on off stump, he drives smoothly to long-off;
34.4;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run pushes it through on middle, he defends;
34.3;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run makes room to slide the shortish dleivery through cover point;
34.2;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run risky run, Guptill's on it, Khawaja's in trouble.... no direct hit! Khawaja wants a single after mistiming the cut shot. He's too early on it and the slow pace of KW makes the bat face close and the ball go to cover. Guptill moves quickly enough to his right, takes aim at the non-strikers' end, couldn't hit the target;
34.1;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run slinks back to cut a shortish delivery outside off. Can't beat the field;
33.6;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run opens the face and slices the shortish ball outside off to third man;
33.5;1;de Grandhomme to Carey, 1 run;
33.4;4;de Grandhomme to Carey, FOUR runs superb hit! And it's because he is basically pulling a good length ball outside off. You know, the kind you're told to bowl in Test cricket. Only here, this extremely talented left-hander picks up the length so early and also takes the extra credit points as well by hitting with a relatively straight bat to send the ball skimming past wide mid-on (can't cross-bat those balls because they're not short enough);
33.3;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run works the back of a length delivery on middle to short midwicket;
33.2;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run opens the face to try and get the gap behind point. No such luck;
33.1;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run back of a length and outside off, taps it to cover;
32.6;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run full and outside off, steers it to the sweeper. This is a very good stand from two relatively unheralded batsmen in this line-up. But seriously, Carey shouldn't be batting so low!;
32.5;?;Williamson to Carey, no run beats him with a very slow ball outside off. Carey is looking to hit this too hard through the covers and is good enough to keep that back leg pegged in the ground. Good take from Latham as well;
32.4;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run short and wide outside off, Khawaja rocks back to cut to deep point;
32.3;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run full on middle, Khawaja blocks;
32.2;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run the ball is way outside off but Carey still reaches it with the sweep, hitting it over the top at midwicket;
32.1;?;Williamson to Carey, no run loads up the sweep and gets to the ball on the full, dragging it from middle stump to short fine leg;
31.6;1;de Grandhomme to Carey, 1 run punches the ball looking for the top of off stump to long-off. That's drinks;
31.5;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run opens the face at the last second to slice a back of a length delivery to the left of backward point;
31.4;1;de Grandhomme to Carey, 1 run;
31.3;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run neat flick round the corner as Khawaja waits on the ball to come to him. Seems effortlessly doing that when the ball is in line with the stumps, but whenever the ball is wider of off stump, he seems to go at it too hard and too soon;
31.2;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run stays back and blocks the shortish delivery outside off;
31.1;2;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 2 runs beautiful shot to raise a tough fifty! Shuffling inside the line of a short ball - a short ball at CdG's pace is zero threat - and flicks it behind square leg. Good manipulation of the field;
30.6;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run lovely wrists as he waits on the tossed up ball on middle and whips it to long-on;
30.5;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run attempts a drive away from the body and gets a thick outside edge to short third man;
30.4;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run premeditates a scoop and has to deal with a ball well outside off - the kind he has been cover driving for four like a boss. Here though, he has to settle for a single to fine leg;
30.3;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run full and outside off, smears it through the covers;
30.2;2;Williamson to Khawaja, 2 runs nicks past the keeper! If KW's getting spin off a pitch, you know it ain't straight forward. Khawaja is drawn into the drive. The ball dips in front of him, messing up his timing. Then it turns, securing the outside edge;
30.1;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run tosses it up outside off from round the wicket, Khawaja jams the bat down on it and sends it to cover;
29.6;4;de Grandhomme to Carey, FOUR runs full, and he drives this handsomely past mid off. Terrific shot!;
29.5;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run fuller length, angles away from him, and beats him with the line! Carey plays inside the line of this, and it just evades the outside edge. Well bowled!;
29.4;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run full, angles away and he runs it towards backward point with a flourish of his wrists;
29.3;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run fuller, and he whips it away from outside off, but cannot beat short midwicket;
29.2;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run full, and he drives, but cannot beat Williamson at covers;
29.1;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run length, outside off, and he drives this to covers;
28.6;4;Ferguson to Carey, FOUR runs fuller, on the pads, and he flicks this away towards long leg. Ready for the variation in length - excellent batting!;
28.5;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run short, again homing in towards the batsman's face. Carey drops it with his glove, just fending off his helmet. Well played in the end;
28.4;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run length, angles away, and he defends this towards point;
28.3;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run short ball, lifts off at 149kph, and Carey has to duck out of the way! Not dissimilar to the ball that dismissed David Warner!;
28.2;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run short, angles across him from outside leg, and he defends as the line tucks him up;
28.1;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run short, down the leg side and he plays it down with a flick of the wrists towards long leg;
27.6;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run length, straighter, and he drives it back to the bowler. Delivered at just 126kph;
27.5;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run length, angles away and he defends this;
27.4;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run full, a bit wider, and he drives this through covers towards the sweeper stationed there now;
27.3;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run length, straight, and he drives it back down the pitch;
27.2;1;de Grandhomme to Carey, 1 run length, angles away and he pushes it just wide of Williamson at cover and picks up a single;
27.1;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run full ball, angles away and he drives it back down the pitch;
26.6;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run length, angles across him, and he defends. This was bowled at 149kph, as Ferguson continues to crank it up;
26.5;1;Ferguson to Carey, 1 run short, angles towards his pads from outside leg, and he tucks a 141kph ball away towards short midwicket;
26.4;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run shorter, angles across him after pitching outside leg, and he defends from the crease;
26.3;4;Ferguson to Carey, FOUR runs full, wide, and he cracks another lovely cover drive. Just timing, and placement...nothing more...;
26.2;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run length, angles away at 143kph, and he runs this down to third man;
26.1;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run full, and he drives this towards cover;
25.6;4;Neesham to Carey, FOUR runs SHOT! Full, and he leans into a beautiful cover drive. There's a sweeper cover, but he can only admire this as it runs across to his left;
25.5;1;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 run length, and he shimmies across to the off side and paddles this away towards long leg;
25.4;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run length, angles across him at 134kph, and he defends this close to the body;
25.3;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run full, outside off, and stops a bit on the pitch again. He drives, and it comes off the inside of the bat back towards the bowler;
25.2;1;Neesham to Carey, 1 run length, stops on him a bit, as he looks to check his drive. Floats in the air, but goes through the vacant cover region towards sweeper cover;
25.1;?;Neesham to Carey, no run length, angles across him, and he defends. Off the inside of his bat on to his pads;
24.6;1;Santner to Carey, 1 run sweeps a full ball from off stump towards long leg. Almost a horizontal bat drive along the floor;
24.5;?;Santner to Carey, no run looks to advance down the pitch, and Santner sees that and fires this wider. Forced to defend;
24.4;?;Santner to Carey, no run full, towards leg stump, and he sweeps, but cannot beat the man at 45 degrees on the on side;
24.3;1;Santner to Khawaja, 1 run full, turns into him, and he drives this down towards long on;
24.2;2;Santner to Khawaja, 2 runs fuller, and he pulls out the reverse paddle. Gets it wide of short third man, and they are able to pick up two before backward point can mop up;
24.1;?;Santner to Khawaja, no run tossed up outside off, and he looks for the reverse paddle, but cannot beat short third man;
23.6;1;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 run shorter, slower through the air at 132kph, and he flicks it away towards long leg;
23.5;1;Neesham to Carey, 1 run length, straight enough for him to be able to nurdle this away towards midwicket;
23.4;?;Neesham to Carey, no run length, outside off, and he defends;
23.3;?;Neesham to Carey, no run length, angles across him, as he leaves;
23.2;1;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 run DROPPED! There's actually a slip now for Khawaja, and it eludes him too after coming off Latham's gloves. So unlucky for Neesham! Extra bounce from a length, and he looks to bail out of a drive, but gets it off the outer edge. It flies towards Latham's left, and he gets a glove to it, but can only pop it up behind himself;
23.1;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run full, wide, and he has a swish at it, but misses;
22.6;?;Santner to Carey, no run big turn again, from outside off, and takes the pads on its way through to short third man;
22.5;4;Santner to Carey, FOUR runs reverse sweep pulled out to a length ball just outside off. Gets it square enough to beat short third man, and fine enough to beat backward point;
22.4;1;Santner to Khawaja, 1 run length, turns into him, and he plays it with the tide towards short midwicket;
22.3;?;Santner to Khawaja, no run length, turns in from outside off, and strikes him on the pads as he looks to drive this. Not given! Will they review this? Williamson decides not to;
22.2;2;Santner to Khawaja, 2 runs length, and he plays it late off the keeper's gloves down towards third man;
22.1;1;Santner to Carey, 1 run length ball, turns into the batsman, who sweeps this towards long leg;
21.6;1;Neesham to Carey, 1 run length, angles into him and down the pads and whipped away towards long leg;
21.5;4;Neesham to Carey, FOUR runs full, and gorgeous cover drive. Just a bit of foot movement, but fast hands that carry this blitzing through the off side field;
21.4;?;Neesham to Carey, no run full, angling across him, and he plays it towards point;
21.3;W;Neesham to Maxwell, OUT WHAT A CATCH! If you thought Guptill had one of the rippers for the day, Jimmy Neesham has just sent in his nomination for moment of the day! It comes off the bottom of Maxwell's blade as he looks to pull a short one outside off, and Neesham dives away to his left and picks up a one-handed grab. That's the kind of catch you would be tempted to take out for dinner, and take home to introduce to your parents. New Zealand are on fire!;Glenn Maxwell c & b Neesham 1 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
21.2;?;Neesham to Maxwell, no run full, on to the pads, and he drives it towards the wide mid off;
21.1;?;Neesham to Maxwell, no run full, on the pads, and he plays it towards wide mid on. Wants a single, but that went too quickly for them to get that much time. Sent back by the non-striker;
20.6;1;Santner to Maxwell, 1 run quicker ball, slants down the leg side, and he looks to glance this. Gets it off the pad towards fine leg;
20.5;?;Santner to Maxwell, no run angles into him from around the wicket, and he defends;
20.4;1;Santner to Khawaja, 1 run goes back and tucks this away with the turn towards long leg;
20.3;?;Santner to Khawaja, no run tossed up, and he drives it back with the turn to the bowler;
20.3;5w;Santner to Khawaja, 5 wide down the legside. He looks for the sweep, and it goes down for four. Given wides, as it started from beyond leg and turned further away;
20.2;4;Santner to Khawaja, FOUR runs slants across him, and he cuts this fine. The backspin puts it beyond the reach of Lockie Ferguson at the deep point fence;
20.1;?;Santner to Khawaja, no run full ball, angles into him from around the wicket, and he defends this, pressed forward;
19.6;W;Neesham to Stoinis, OUT caught behind! Neesh delivers an absolute peach. A cross-seamer that hits the deck. The line is close enough to off stump. The length though is in-between. Not full enough for the drive. Not short enough for the cut. Stoinis presses forward gamely, looking to block the ball out. But it's mischief not done yet. It decks away off the pitch, takes the outside edge and settles in the keeper's gloves. Top stuff.;Marcus Stoinis c ?Latham b Neesham 21 (41m 26b 3x4 0x6) SR: 80.76;
19.5;1;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 run slashes a good length ball outside off to deep point;
19.4;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run with the batsman going so far across his stumps, Neesh tries to sneak a leg-stump yorker and take him out. Gets close but not close enough. Puts his hand on his mouth and the eyes bug out after the plan fails;
19.3;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run looks for the on the up drive but the 135 kph ball, on a good length and outside off, sticks in the pitch and bounces awkwardly on Khawaja. So much that he yanks the bottom hand away;
19.3;1w;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 wide full and very very wide outside off and he'll have to re-bowl that;
19.2;1;Neesham to Stoinis, 1 run eases the shortish delivery outside off to third man;
19.1;1lb;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 leg bye walks right across his stumps and gets struck on the pads as he tries to flick the ball through midwicket. Khawaja is trying to one-up NZ's 6-3 off side field;
18.6;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run strays onto his pads and he sends it away to fine leg;
18.5;?;Sodhi to Khawaja, no run doesn't pick the googly and what's worse, he follows the ball turning the wrong way with his hands. With slip in place, that's quite dangerous. This time though Khawaja is able to keep the ball along the ground to point;
18.4;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run uses his reach to get to the pitch of the ball outside off and drive to long-off. Lovely contest brewin, fellas.;
18.3;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run stays back to deal with a length ball on middle behind square leg. Quick hands. Seriously quick hands;
18.2;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run slices it through cover point;
18.1;?;Sodhi to Stoinis, no run tentative block - and it's all because of that lovely loop from Sodhi. He's in good rhythm today. No long hops. And practically everything in that dangerous off stump line, spinning both ways;
17.6;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run another lovely hit, opening the face of the bat to try and get the gap to the right of mid-off. KW won't allow it;
17.5;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run full and a lot closer to his body, allowing him to use a straight bat and hit to mid-off;
17.4;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run full and wide, tempting the drive away from the body - this is starting to look like a plan with a gully in place and most of the fielders on the off side - Khawaja doesn't play at it this time;
17.3;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run lovely flowing drive off the front foot, but he can't beat point.;
17.2;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run full and outside off, he drives to mid-off;
17.1;1;Neesham to Stoinis, 1 run flicks a shortish delivery on the pads to midwicket;
16.6;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run drills a tossed up ball outside off to long-off;
16.5;?;Sodhi to Stoinis, no run doesn't read the googly and has to weather and lbw appeal. Would've been going down though. Sodhi pitches it on middle and the right-hander is setting up to hammer it through the off side, going deep in his crease, and it lands him in a bit of trouble;
16.4;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run crunches the short ball turning away from him through cover point. Good footwork from Khawaja, used the depth of the crease perfectly;
16.3;?;Sodhi to Khawaja, no run shapes to sweep again, but the ball is a little too full, and a little too far outside off and so he has to adjust and tap it back to the bowler with a straight bat;
16.2;2;Sodhi to Khawaja, 2 runs a little too leg side this time, inviting the sweep shot and Khawaja is only too happy to oblige. Gets it nice and fine;
16.1;?;Sodhi to Khawaja, no run pitches the googly short enough that the left-hander can go back, read the turn off the pitch and tap it into the covers;
15.6;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run searing yorker to end the over, one that keeps coming in with the angle into the right-hander. Stoinis is alert enough to prevent it from rendezvousing with the stumps. That's drinks and this is very very fun.;
15.5;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run bouncer outside off, no shot from Stoinis;
15.4;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run caaatcch, they cry... Williamson's the fielder, running up and to his left from mid-off. Goes for the dive. He's aaaaaalmost there. The hands reach out. Has he taken it? Have NZ done it again? Nooooo. The captain comes up and shakes his head. It's fallen short of him. Stoinis lives to drive on the up again;
15.3;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run lovely shot to cross 1000 runs in 2019. Stands tall against a back of a length delivery outside off and flays it behind point;
15.2;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run works the length ball on middle to short midwicket.;
15.1;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run keeps thudding 140+ kph deliveries into the deck, hoping to catch the batsman on the hop. Khawaja though won't be tempted into such silly situations;
14.6;?;Sodhi to Stoinis, no run flatter trajectory outside off, Stoinis goes back to cut to cover point;
14.5;?;Sodhi to Stoinis, no run slow legbreak, drifting in on middle stump. Stoinis goes for the inside out drive to short cover;
14.4;?;Sodhi to Stoinis, no run zips in off the pitch looking for lbw, but Stoinis brings the bat down in time, and importantly it's straight. Sodhi's doing very well here;
14.3;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run drags it short and Khawaja has all the time in the world, and then some, to pull to deep square leg;
14.2;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run brings down the flight a bit, but still keeps the length full. The bigger adjustment is in the line, dragging it outside off, and making sure Stoinis can only drive through the covers;
14.1;4;Sodhi to Stoinis, FOUR runs over mid-on! Stoinis sees one tossed up and knows it's just got to go. Lunges forward and whacks it down the ground and gets just about lucky enough to beat a leaping KW at the 30-yard circle;
13.6;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run 144 kph bouncer angled at the body but Khawaja sees it early and lets it go;
13.5;1;Ferguson to Stoinis, 1 run bounces him and Stoinis can't get out of the way. How can he when it's 148 kph? He tries to ride it, getting up off his toes to drop the ball by his feet, but it still keeps climbing on him, takes the shoulder of the bat and lobs over to where short third man might have been;
13.4;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run good length, outside off, no shot;
13.3;4;Ferguson to Stoinis, FOUR runs gooooooorrrrrge! Who cares if it's coming in at 150 clicks? Who cares if it's not a half-volley. It's wide enough. I can free my arms. I've got the powah. Now watch me as I cover drive the heck outta this;
13.2;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run stands in the way of a 144 kph delivery and its date with middle stump;
13.1;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run short ball meets soft hands, little tap into the off side and a rapid run to put the icing on the cake;
12.6;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run stays back to a good length ball outside off and slices it in front of point;
12.5;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run smoothly done by Stoinis as he gets back and across to a short and wide ball and cuts to the sweeper;
12.4;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run whips a loopy ball on off stump to long-on;
12.3;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run stands up tall and punches the shortish delivery outside off to long-off;
12.2;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run resorts to the sweep straight away - which gives a batsmen who isn't reading the turn a little more margin for error - and takes a ball on a length on off stump for a trip to fine leg;
12.1;?;Sodhi to Khawaja, no run googly to start and I'm not sure Khawaja picks it. Reaches out to defend and is comfortably beaten;
11.6;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run;
11.5;4;Ferguson to Stoinis, FOUR runs width on offer and Stoinis whacks it away towards the point boundary. There's protection there. And he's quality too. Only Boult has the ball climbing along his forearms like a ramp instead of sticking in his palms and the fumble leads to a boundary;
11.4;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run;
11.3;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run back of a length and outside off at 90 mph, Stoinis pushes into the covers;
11.2;W;Ferguson to Smith, OUT falls into the trap! New Zealand had a leg gully lurking. They were going to attack SS with the short ball. They were hoping he'd flick one in the air and this guy can grab it. But this is a full blooded pull shot. This is coming off at a zillion miles an hour. And it's not even right at the fielder. A fielder who's already dropped two catches. Guptill doesn't care though. He spots the ball early enough. He dives to his left quickly enough. Sticks out his hand and comes up with an absolute specy! This is going to be one of the catches of the tournament. Smith's copped the end of two of those now and New Zealand are now nice and snug in the driver's seat. The broadcast graphics say Guptill was only 17 m away from the batsman. Also, in terms of reaction time, he only had 0.6 seconds to pull off that miracle. #WOAH!;Steven Smith c Guptill b Ferguson 5 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 62.5;
11.1;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run works it off his pads behind square leg. Too easy, even at Fergie's pace;
10.6;?;Boult to Smith, no run stays over the wicket - with no mid-off - and pitches the ball up on middle stump. Smith springs across and then, after teasing all of us with those rubber wrists, only defends. Boooo!;
10.5;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run gets across his stumps because he reads the short ball early and knows there's a sprawling gap at long leg. Good pull game plan. Good pull shot;
10.4;3;Boult to Smith, 3 runs goes round the stumps straight away to SS, who is only too happy to work with the angle and flick the fuller delivery from outside off down the ground past the right of the bowler;
10.3;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run goes for the magic ball, pitching leg and swinging away to take the leading edge. No such luck as Khawaja flicks the ball on the pads to deep square leg;
10.2;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run beats him again! This time with good old fashioned line and length outside off. Khawaja has this habit of reaching out away from his body - because he rarely moves his feet, especially forward. And that time there's just enough away movement to beat the edge;
10.1;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run bouncer which Khawaja tries to hook away, but he's gonna need a stepladder for that. The Lord's hospitality doesn't quite go that far;
9.6;?;Ferguson to Smith, no run length, and he defends this 145kph ball angling into him;
9.5;?;Ferguson to Smith, no run shorter, angles into him, and he defends this towards cover. 146kph!;
9.4;2;Ferguson to Smith, 2 runs full ball, and he drives this towards point. Able to get past the man there, but cover runs along and keeps it from reaching the boundary;
9.3;?;Ferguson to Smith, no run length, angles into him again, and he plays it away towards point;
9.2;?;Ferguson to Smith, no run length, jags into him, and he forces himself to come forward and just defend;
9.1;W;Ferguson to Warner, OUT short, and he has got Warner with a snorter! Delivered at 142kph, and following him as he looks to sway out of its way, this ball takes off and takes Warner along its way through to Latham. Ferguson had no doubt, and neither did Warner. Both openers dismissed this early, wow!;David Warner c ?Latham b Ferguson 16 (39m 23b 3x4 0x6) SR: 69.56;
8.6;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run full, and driven towards point;
8.5;2;Boult to Khawaja, 2 runs full, outside off, and he drives this just out of the reach of cover. They will get two as the fielder half-stops it;
8.4;4;Boult to Khawaja, FOUR runs full, on the pads, and he can tuck this away towards long leg. The man at deep backward square leg cannot get across to this;
8.3;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run throws this a bit wider, fuller, and he drives as it swings away from him. Goes straight to point;
8.2;2;Boult to Khawaja, 2 runs full, on the pads, and he flicks this past short midwicket. There's a man in the deep who will get to this on his right, but they will return for the second;
8.1;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run length, outside off, and he defends this to point;
49.6;?;Boult to Lyon, no run full, wide outside off, and he looks to back away to get this down to fine leg, but misses. Almost got FOUR IN FOUR!;
49.5;W;Boult to Behrendorff, OUT HE'S GOT IT! Full, swinging away from him after pitching around leg, and given. Australia have reviewed this! It's a perfect full length, and there's no sign of bat near that. The only question could be where it pitched, I would think. The bat hits ground, but that is after the ball passes through and crashes into his right foot. It's out, and that's a hat-trick for Trent Boult!;Jason Behrendorff lbw b Boult 0 (4m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
49.4;W;Boult to Starc, OUT OH YOU BEAUTY! We might get to see a bit of this from Starc later -- a perfect yorker, that swings in at good pace and goes under his blade even as he looks to jam it down. Almost as good as the ball that Starc delivered to Ben Stokes just a few days ago!;Mitchell Starc b Boult 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
49.3;W;Boult to Khawaja, OUT GONE THIS TIME! Perfect full ball again, delivered at 137kph, and with a hint of reverse again back in from outside off. Khawaja walks across to access the on side, but misses out on contact and in fact walks right outside the line of the ball. Vital half-century from Khawaja, though, as he acknowledges the crowd on his way out;Usman Khawaja b Boult 88 (187m 129b 5x4 0x6) SR: 68.21;
49.2;1;Boult to Cummins, 1 run fuller ball, around the stumps, and he can only tap it towards short midwicket;
49.1;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run low full toss, swinging back in, and he drives it down to long off. Bowled at 144kph;
48.6;4;Ferguson to Cummins, FOUR runs full toss, and this time he has pierced the infield! Backs away, and even takes the bottom hand as he muscles this through cover, and too fast for sweeper at the point fence to get to it. What a hand this is from Cummins...;
48.5;2;Ferguson to Cummins, 2 runs full toss, outside off, and he looks to drive this down the ground. Outside edge runs it down to the right of third man, and they scurry through for the second;
48.4;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run short, and he drop-kicks this, one bounce towards long leg;
48.3;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run short, and he ducks under it. Decides late to try and run it down towards third man, but that had already passed him by then;
48.2;1;Ferguson to Cummins, 1 run full, outside off, and he guides a 143kph ball towards deep point;
48.1;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run backs away to the legside and biffs a full ball down towards long on;
41.6;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run full, outside off, and he opens up the face of his blade to run it towards deep point;
41.5;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run length, and he drives on the up, but cannot beat cover;
41.4;1;Boult to Carey, 1 run fuller ball, a hint of reverse back into him, as he biffs this off the inside of the bat towards deep backward square leg;
41.3;2;Boult to Carey, 2 runs length, and he drives this past covers. Seems like a change of pace, but he picked it well. That also brings up the 100-run partnership;
41.2;?;Boult to Carey, no run length, and the ball stops on Carey as he looks to drive this down the ground. Not able to time this well at all;
41.1;?;Boult to Carey, no run length, and he drives it but cannot beat mid off;
40.6;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run was that dropped? Too full for the cut, as he backs away and looks to get it through the offside. Goes through to Latham, but no great reactions from the bowler. Seems to be have been just a bad miss;
40.5;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run goes back and drives it towards point;
40.4;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run flatter, outside off, and he swats it away towards deep midwicket;
40.3;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run leans back and cuts a length ball outside off away towards deep backward point;
40.2;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run flighted outside off, and he drives back to the bowler;
40.1;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run tossed up outside off, and he drives but cannot beat point;
47.6;2;Boult to Cummins, 2 runs short ball, and he moves away to the leg side and ramps it down towards third man. Cheeky!;
47.5;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run swings into him from a full length, and he takes it on the full and drops it down towards long leg;
47.4;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run backs away, and Boult shortens the length. Wants to go over point, but misses out on contact;
47.3;4;Boult to Khawaja, FOUR runs gets lucky! Charges down to a fuller ball again, and with the late reverse swing, it takes the inside edge and runs fine past Latham;
47.2;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run precise yorker. Swings a bit late into him, and he can only dig it out towards cover;
47.1;1;Boult to Cummins, 1 run wide outside off, and he drives this towards sweeper cover;
46.6;1;Sodhi to Cummins, 1 run length, wide outside off, and he slaps this down to long off;
46.5;2;Sodhi to Cummins, 2 runs length, and he swings this towards deep midwicket. To the right of Neesham, who nonchalantly knocks this back into play with his right hand. Superb fielding, but vital runs for Australia!;
46.4;2;Sodhi to Cummins, 2 runs tossed up outside off, and he goes for it down the ground. Takes the leading edge, and this time it lands just short of long on!;
46.3;2;Sodhi to Cummins, 2 runs length, and he goes inside out. Drops short of long off;
46.2;2;Sodhi to Cummins, 2 runs length, and he goes towards deep midwicket. Could have had four, but for Jimmy Neesham, who fields this down to his left;
46.1;?;Sodhi to Cummins, no run floats this wide outside off, and beats a swat from Cummins;
39.6;1lb;Boult to Khawaja, 1 leg bye looks to flick a fuller delivery on leg stump to fine leg. But only ends up making contact with the pad;
39.5;1;Boult to Carey, 1 run shortish and outside off, slices to the sweeper;
39.4;?;Boult to Carey, no run good length outside off, he drives to mid-off;
39.3;4;Boult to Carey, FOUR runs and now he's playing all the orthodox stuff. The picture perfect off drive. Placed to the right of Williamson. Amazing timing on a pitch that isn't suiting such shots;
39.2;?;Boult to Carey, no run nudges the length ball on middle to midwicket;
39.1;?;Boult to Carey, no run half an lbw appeal but Boult bails out of it. Would've gone down. Decent straight though. The ball on a good length and nipping into Carey, who wasn't expecting that as he plays the flick;
38.6;2;Williamson to Khawaja, 2 runs width again and Khawaja slaps it to the left of backward point;
38.5;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run shortish and outside off, he rocks back and cuts to deep point;
38.4;?;Williamson to Carey, no run;
38.3;?;Williamson to Carey, no run sweeps to midwicket;
38.2;?;Williamson to Carey, no run edged but safe. Williamson has been teasing the left-handers with a lot of flight. Drawing them into the drive outside off. Carey's sucked into the trap, gets a very thick nick, Latham follows it, staying down and getting up with the ball, but he can't grab it in the end;
38.1;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run very very full - so much that it becomes a low full toss on middle. Khawaja drives to long-off;
37.6;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run shortish on off stump, pushes into the covers;
37.5;4;Ferguson to Carey, FOUR runs unreal! Ferguson loves bowling short. He's had success bowling short. But this is only 142 kph. And it's only above waist high. All of that essentially means it's in Carey's wheelhouse and he just stands tall and slams it over deep midwicket #LikeABoss;
37.4;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run defends a good length ball on off stump to point;
37.3;2;Ferguson to Carey, 2 runs waits on the short ball outside off and carves it behind point. Guptill is there and he gets a hand on it to parry it towards third man;
37.2;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run hangs back and pulls a short ball outside of at 145 kph to short midwicket.;
37.1;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run looks to flick a shortish ball on leg stump through square leg, but is into the shot a touch too early. And no wonder. This is only at 141 kph. Fergs bowls 150.;
36.6;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run presents the inside out drive to long-off;
36.5;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run loops it up outside off and Khawaja unleashes a flowing drive to the sweeper;
36.4;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run full on off stump, Khawaja plays a little inside the line because of KW's drift, and the turn secures the outside edge to point;
36.3;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run fullish and outside off, he plays from the crease and slices it to cover;
36.2;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run stays back to try and cut a ball that isn't quite short enough and is beaten again;
36.1;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run beats him as Khawaja once again plays too far away from his body without moving his front foot across;
35.6;1;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 run gets up with the short ball outside off and pulls it down to deep square leg. Good technique, playing it on top of the bounce and rolling the wrists to keep it down;
35.5;1;Neesham to Carey, 1 run back of a length and outside off, spears it through to the sweeper;
35.4;4;Neesham to Carey, FOUR runs streaky shot but a super cool fifty. Looks to drive a wide ball outside off through the covers but ends up with an inside edge past the keeper. Deserves that luck. He's played with a lot of skill and no shortage of punch. Made Australia's quickest World Cup fifty earlier this tournament. Following it up with another lovely little innings;
35.3;?;Neesham to Carey, no run blocks a back of a length delivery to point;
35.2;?;Neesham to Carey, no run tucks him up with a back of a length ball on middle. Defends;
35.1;4;Neesham to Carey, FOUR runs outrageous! This is an attempted bouncer outside off. So pulling it carries risk. But Carey manages it beautifully by leaping off his feet, getting on top of the ball and hammering it away through wide mid-on.;
34.6;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run backs away and cuts the shortish delivery through to the sweeper;
34.5;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run full on off stump, he drives smoothly to long-off;
34.4;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run pushes it through on middle, he defends;
34.3;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run makes room to slide the shortish dleivery through cover point;
34.2;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run risky run, Guptill's on it, Khawaja's in trouble.... no direct hit! Khawaja wants a single after mistiming the cut shot. He's too early on it and the slow pace of KW makes the bat face close and the ball go to cover. Guptill moves quickly enough to his right, takes aim at the non-strikers' end, couldn't hit the target;
34.1;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run slinks back to cut a shortish delivery outside off. Can't beat the field;
33.6;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run opens the face and slices the shortish ball outside off to third man;
33.5;1;de Grandhomme to Carey, 1 run;
33.4;4;de Grandhomme to Carey, FOUR runs superb hit! And it's because he is basically pulling a good length ball outside off. You know, the kind you're told to bowl in Test cricket. Only here, this extremely talented left-hander picks up the length so early and also takes the extra credit points as well by hitting with a relatively straight bat to send the ball skimming past wide mid-on (can't cross-bat those balls because they're not short enough);
33.3;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run works the back of a length delivery on middle to short midwicket;
33.2;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run opens the face to try and get the gap behind point. No such luck;
33.1;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run back of a length and outside off, taps it to cover;
32.6;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run full and outside off, steers it to the sweeper. This is a very good stand from two relatively unheralded batsmen in this line-up. But seriously, Carey shouldn't be batting so low!;
32.5;?;Williamson to Carey, no run beats him with a very slow ball outside off. Carey is looking to hit this too hard through the covers and is good enough to keep that back leg pegged in the ground. Good take from Latham as well;
32.4;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run short and wide outside off, Khawaja rocks back to cut to deep point;
32.3;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run full on middle, Khawaja blocks;
32.2;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run the ball is way outside off but Carey still reaches it with the sweep, hitting it over the top at midwicket;
32.1;?;Williamson to Carey, no run loads up the sweep and gets to the ball on the full, dragging it from middle stump to short fine leg;
31.6;1;de Grandhomme to Carey, 1 run punches the ball looking for the top of off stump to long-off. That's drinks;
31.5;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run opens the face at the last second to slice a back of a length delivery to the left of backward point;
31.4;1;de Grandhomme to Carey, 1 run;
31.3;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run neat flick round the corner as Khawaja waits on the ball to come to him. Seems effortlessly doing that when the ball is in line with the stumps, but whenever the ball is wider of off stump, he seems to go at it too hard and too soon;
31.2;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run stays back and blocks the shortish delivery outside off;
31.1;2;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 2 runs beautiful shot to raise a tough fifty! Shuffling inside the line of a short ball - a short ball at CdG's pace is zero threat - and flicks it behind square leg. Good manipulation of the field;
30.6;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run lovely wrists as he waits on the tossed up ball on middle and whips it to long-on;
30.5;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run attempts a drive away from the body and gets a thick outside edge to short third man;
30.4;1;Williamson to Carey, 1 run premeditates a scoop and has to deal with a ball well outside off - the kind he has been cover driving for four like a boss. Here though, he has to settle for a single to fine leg;
30.3;1;Williamson to Khawaja, 1 run full and outside off, smears it through the covers;
30.2;2;Williamson to Khawaja, 2 runs nicks past the keeper! If KW's getting spin off a pitch, you know it ain't straight forward. Khawaja is drawn into the drive. The ball dips in front of him, messing up his timing. Then it turns, securing the outside edge;
30.1;?;Williamson to Khawaja, no run tosses it up outside off from round the wicket, Khawaja jams the bat down on it and sends it to cover;
29.6;4;de Grandhomme to Carey, FOUR runs full, and he drives this handsomely past mid off. Terrific shot!;
29.5;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run fuller length, angles away from him, and beats him with the line! Carey plays inside the line of this, and it just evades the outside edge. Well bowled!;
29.4;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run full, angles away and he runs it towards backward point with a flourish of his wrists;
29.3;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run fuller, and he whips it away from outside off, but cannot beat short midwicket;
29.2;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run full, and he drives, but cannot beat Williamson at covers;
29.1;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run length, outside off, and he drives this to covers;
28.6;4;Ferguson to Carey, FOUR runs fuller, on the pads, and he flicks this away towards long leg. Ready for the variation in length - excellent batting!;
28.5;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run short, again homing in towards the batsman's face. Carey drops it with his glove, just fending off his helmet. Well played in the end;
28.4;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run length, angles away, and he defends this towards point;
28.3;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run short ball, lifts off at 149kph, and Carey has to duck out of the way! Not dissimilar to the ball that dismissed David Warner!;
28.2;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run short, angles across him from outside leg, and he defends as the line tucks him up;
28.1;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run short, down the leg side and he plays it down with a flick of the wrists towards long leg;
27.6;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run length, straighter, and he drives it back to the bowler. Delivered at just 126kph;
27.5;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run length, angles away and he defends this;
27.4;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run full, a bit wider, and he drives this through covers towards the sweeper stationed there now;
27.3;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run length, straight, and he drives it back down the pitch;
27.2;1;de Grandhomme to Carey, 1 run length, angles away and he pushes it just wide of Williamson at cover and picks up a single;
27.1;?;de Grandhomme to Carey, no run full ball, angles away and he drives it back down the pitch;

26.4;?;Ferguson to Carey, no run shorter, angles across him after pitching outside leg, and he defends from the crease;
26.3;4;Ferguson to Carey, FOUR runs full, wide, and he cracks another lovely cover drive. Just timing, and placement...nothing more...;
26.2;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run length, angles away at 143kph, and he runs this down to third man;
26.1;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run full, and he drives this towards cover;
25.6;4;Neesham to Carey, FOUR runs SHOT! Full, and he leans into a beautiful cover drive. There's a sweeper cover, but he can only admire this as it runs across to his left;
25.5;1;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 run length, and he shimmies across to the off side and paddles this away towards long leg;
25.4;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run length, angles across him at 134kph, and he defends this close to the body;
25.3;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run full, outside off, and stops a bit on the pitch again. He drives, and it comes off the inside of the bat back towards the bowler;
25.2;1;Neesham to Carey, 1 run length, stops on him a bit, as he looks to check his drive. Floats in the air, but goes through the vacant cover region towards sweeper cover;
25.1;?;Neesham to Carey, no run length, angles across him, and he defends. Off the inside of his bat on to his pads;
24.6;1;Santner to Carey, 1 run sweeps a full ball from off stump towards long leg. Almost a horizontal bat drive along the floor;
24.5;?;Santner to Carey, no run looks to advance down the pitch, and Santner sees that and fires this wider. Forced to defend;
24.4;?;Santner to Carey, no run full, towards leg stump, and he sweeps, but cannot beat the man at 45 degrees on the on side;
24.3;1;Santner to Khawaja, 1 run full, turns into him, and he drives this down towards long on;
24.2;2;Santner to Khawaja, 2 runs fuller, and he pulls out the reverse paddle. Gets it wide of short third man, and they are able to pick up two before backward point can mop up;
24.1;?;Santner to Khawaja, no run tossed up outside off, and he looks for the reverse paddle, but cannot beat short third man;
23.6;1;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 run shorter, slower through the air at 132kph, and he flicks it away towards long leg;
23.5;1;Neesham to Carey, 1 run length, straight enough for him to be able to nurdle this away towards midwicket;
23.4;?;Neesham to Carey, no run length, outside off, and he defends;
23.3;?;Neesham to Carey, no run length, angles across him, as he leaves;
23.2;1;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 run DROPPED! There's actually a slip now for Khawaja, and it eludes him too after coming off Latham's gloves. So unlucky for Neesham! Extra bounce from a length, and he looks to bail out of a drive, but gets it off the outer edge. It flies towards Latham's left, and he gets a glove to it, but can only pop it up behind himself;
23.1;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run full, wide, and he has a swish at it, but misses;
22.6;?;Santner to Carey, no run big turn again, from outside off, and takes the pads on its way through to short third man;
22.5;4;Santner to Carey, FOUR runs reverse sweep pulled out to a length ball just outside off. Gets it square enough to beat short third man, and fine enough to beat backward point;
22.4;1;Santner to Khawaja, 1 run length, turns into him, and he plays it with the tide towards short midwicket;
22.3;?;Santner to Khawaja, no run length, turns in from outside off, and strikes him on the pads as he looks to drive this. Not given! Will they review this? Williamson decides not to;
22.2;2;Santner to Khawaja, 2 runs length, and he plays it late off the keeper's gloves down towards third man;
22.1;1;Santner to Carey, 1 run length ball, turns into the batsman, who sweeps this towards long leg;
21.6;1;Neesham to Carey, 1 run length, angles into him and down the pads and whipped away towards long leg;
21.5;4;Neesham to Carey, FOUR runs full, and gorgeous cover drive. Just a bit of foot movement, but fast hands that carry this blitzing through the off side field;
21.4;?;Neesham to Carey, no run full, angling across him, and he plays it towards point;
21.3;W;Neesham to Maxwell, OUT WHAT A CATCH! If you thought Guptill had one of the rippers for the day, Jimmy Neesham has just sent in his nomination for moment of the day! It comes off the bottom of Maxwell's blade as he looks to pull a short one outside off, and Neesham dives away to his left and picks up a one-handed grab. That's the kind of catch you would be tempted to take out for dinner, and take home to introduce to your parents. New Zealand are on fire!;Glenn Maxwell c & b Neesham 1 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
21.2;?;Neesham to Maxwell, no run full, on to the pads, and he drives it towards the wide mid off;
21.1;?;Neesham to Maxwell, no run full, on the pads, and he plays it towards wide mid on. Wants a single, but that went too quickly for them to get that much time. Sent back by the non-striker;
20.6;1;Santner to Maxwell, 1 run quicker ball, slants down the leg side, and he looks to glance this. Gets it off the pad towards fine leg;
20.5;?;Santner to Maxwell, no run angles into him from around the wicket, and he defends;
20.4;1;Santner to Khawaja, 1 run goes back and tucks this away with the turn towards long leg;
20.3;?;Santner to Khawaja, no run tossed up, and he drives it back with the turn to the bowler;
20.3;5w;Santner to Khawaja, 5 wide down the legside. He looks for the sweep, and it goes down for four. Given wides, as it started from beyond leg and turned further away;
20.2;4;Santner to Khawaja, FOUR runs slants across him, and he cuts this fine. The backspin puts it beyond the reach of Lockie Ferguson at the deep point fence;
20.1;?;Santner to Khawaja, no run full ball, angles into him from around the wicket, and he defends this, pressed forward;
19.6;W;Neesham to Stoinis, OUT caught behind! Neesh delivers an absolute peach. A cross-seamer that hits the deck. The line is close enough to off stump. The length though is in-between. Not full enough for the drive. Not short enough for the cut. Stoinis presses forward gamely, looking to block the ball out. But it's mischief not done yet. It decks away off the pitch, takes the outside edge and settles in the keeper's gloves. Top stuff.;Marcus Stoinis c ?Latham b Neesham 21 (41m 26b 3x4 0x6) SR: 80.76;
19.5;1;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 run slashes a good length ball outside off to deep point;
19.4;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run with the batsman going so far across his stumps, Neesh tries to sneak a leg-stump yorker and take him out. Gets close but not close enough. Puts his hand on his mouth and the eyes bug out after the plan fails;
19.3;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run looks for the on the up drive but the 135 kph ball, on a good length and outside off, sticks in the pitch and bounces awkwardly on Khawaja. So much that he yanks the bottom hand away;
19.3;1w;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 wide full and very very wide outside off and he'll have to re-bowl that;
19.2;1;Neesham to Stoinis, 1 run eases the shortish delivery outside off to third man;
19.1;1lb;Neesham to Khawaja, 1 leg bye walks right across his stumps and gets struck on the pads as he tries to flick the ball through midwicket. Khawaja is trying to one-up NZ's 6-3 off side field;
18.6;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run strays onto his pads and he sends it away to fine leg;
18.5;?;Sodhi to Khawaja, no run doesn't pick the googly and what's worse, he follows the ball turning the wrong way with his hands. With slip in place, that's quite dangerous. This time though Khawaja is able to keep the ball along the ground to point;
18.4;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run uses his reach to get to the pitch of the ball outside off and drive to long-off. Lovely contest brewin, fellas.;
18.3;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run stays back to deal with a length ball on middle behind square leg. Quick hands. Seriously quick hands;
18.2;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run slices it through cover point;
18.1;?;Sodhi to Stoinis, no run tentative block - and it's all because of that lovely loop from Sodhi. He's in good rhythm today. No long hops. And practically everything in that dangerous off stump line, spinning both ways;
17.6;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run another lovely hit, opening the face of the bat to try and get the gap to the right of mid-off. KW won't allow it;
17.5;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run full and a lot closer to his body, allowing him to use a straight bat and hit to mid-off;
17.4;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run full and wide, tempting the drive away from the body - this is starting to look like a plan with a gully in place and most of the fielders on the off side - Khawaja doesn't play at it this time;
17.3;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run lovely flowing drive off the front foot, but he can't beat point.;
17.2;?;Neesham to Khawaja, no run full and outside off, he drives to mid-off;
17.1;1;Neesham to Stoinis, 1 run flicks a shortish delivery on the pads to midwicket;
16.6;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run drills a tossed up ball outside off to long-off;
16.5;?;Sodhi to Stoinis, no run doesn't read the googly and has to weather and lbw appeal. Would've been going down though. Sodhi pitches it on middle and the right-hander is setting up to hammer it through the off side, going deep in his crease, and it lands him in a bit of trouble;
16.4;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run crunches the short ball turning away from him through cover point. Good footwork from Khawaja, used the depth of the crease perfectly;
16.3;?;Sodhi to Khawaja, no run shapes to sweep again, but the ball is a little too full, and a little too far outside off and so he has to adjust and tap it back to the bowler with a straight bat;
16.2;2;Sodhi to Khawaja, 2 runs a little too leg side this time, inviting the sweep shot and Khawaja is only too happy to oblige. Gets it nice and fine;
16.1;?;Sodhi to Khawaja, no run pitches the googly short enough that the left-hander can go back, read the turn off the pitch and tap it into the covers;
15.6;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run searing yorker to end the over, one that keeps coming in with the angle into the right-hander. Stoinis is alert enough to prevent it from rendezvousing with the stumps. That's drinks and this is very very fun.;
15.5;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run bouncer outside off, no shot from Stoinis;
15.4;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run caaatcch, they cry... Williamson's the fielder, running up and to his left from mid-off. Goes for the dive. He's aaaaaalmost there. The hands reach out. Has he taken it? Have NZ done it again? Nooooo. The captain comes up and shakes his head. It's fallen short of him. Stoinis lives to drive on the up again;
15.3;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run lovely shot to cross 1000 runs in 2019. Stands tall against a back of a length delivery outside off and flays it behind point;
15.2;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run works the length ball on middle to short midwicket.;
15.1;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run keeps thudding 140+ kph deliveries into the deck, hoping to catch the batsman on the hop. Khawaja though won't be tempted into such silly situations;
14.6;?;Sodhi to Stoinis, no run flatter trajectory outside off, Stoinis goes back to cut to cover point;
14.5;?;Sodhi to Stoinis, no run slow legbreak, drifting in on middle stump. Stoinis goes for the inside out drive to short cover;
14.4;?;Sodhi to Stoinis, no run zips in off the pitch looking for lbw, but Stoinis brings the bat down in time, and importantly it's straight. Sodhi's doing very well here;
14.3;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run drags it short and Khawaja has all the time in the world, and then some, to pull to deep square leg;
14.2;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run brings down the flight a bit, but still keeps the length full. The bigger adjustment is in the line, dragging it outside off, and making sure Stoinis can only drive through the covers;
14.1;4;Sodhi to Stoinis, FOUR runs over mid-on! Stoinis sees one tossed up and knows it's just got to go. Lunges forward and whacks it down the ground and gets just about lucky enough to beat a leaping KW at the 30-yard circle;
13.6;?;Ferguson to Khawaja, no run 144 kph bouncer angled at the body but Khawaja sees it early and lets it go;
13.5;1;Ferguson to Stoinis, 1 run bounces him and Stoinis can't get out of the way. How can he when it's 148 kph? He tries to ride it, getting up off his toes to drop the ball by his feet, but it still keeps climbing on him, takes the shoulder of the bat and lobs over to where short third man might have been;
13.4;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run good length, outside off, no shot;
13.3;4;Ferguson to Stoinis, FOUR runs gooooooorrrrrge! Who cares if it's coming in at 150 clicks? Who cares if it's not a half-volley. It's wide enough. I can free my arms. I've got the powah. Now watch me as I cover drive the heck outta this;
13.2;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run stands in the way of a 144 kph delivery and its date with middle stump;
13.1;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run short ball meets soft hands, little tap into the off side and a rapid run to put the icing on the cake;
12.6;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run stays back to a good length ball outside off and slices it in front of point;
12.5;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run smoothly done by Stoinis as he gets back and across to a short and wide ball and cuts to the sweeper;
12.4;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run whips a loopy ball on off stump to long-on;
12.3;1;Sodhi to Stoinis, 1 run stands up tall and punches the shortish delivery outside off to long-off;
12.2;1;Sodhi to Khawaja, 1 run resorts to the sweep straight away - which gives a batsmen who isn't reading the turn a little more margin for error - and takes a ball on a length on off stump for a trip to fine leg;
12.1;?;Sodhi to Khawaja, no run googly to start and I'm not sure Khawaja picks it. Reaches out to defend and is comfortably beaten;
11.6;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run;
11.5;4;Ferguson to Stoinis, FOUR runs width on offer and Stoinis whacks it away towards the point boundary. There's protection there. And he's quality too. Only Boult has the ball climbing along his forearms like a ramp instead of sticking in his palms and the fumble leads to a boundary;
11.4;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run;
11.3;?;Ferguson to Stoinis, no run back of a length and outside off at 90 mph, Stoinis pushes into the covers;
11.2;W;Ferguson to Smith, OUT falls into the trap! New Zealand had a leg gully lurking. They were going to attack SS with the short ball. They were hoping he'd flick one in the air and this guy can grab it. But this is a full blooded pull shot. This is coming off at a zillion miles an hour. And it's not even right at the fielder. A fielder who's already dropped two catches. Guptill doesn't care though. He spots the ball early enough. He dives to his left quickly enough. Sticks out his hand and comes up with an absolute specy! This is going to be one of the catches of the tournament. Smith's copped the end of two of those now and New Zealand are now nice and snug in the driver's seat. The broadcast graphics say Guptill was only 17 m away from the batsman. Also, in terms of reaction time, he only had 0.6 seconds to pull off that miracle. #WOAH!;Steven Smith c Guptill b Ferguson 5 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 62.5;
11.1;1;Ferguson to Khawaja, 1 run works it off his pads behind square leg. Too easy, even at Fergie's pace;
10.6;?;Boult to Smith, no run stays over the wicket - with no mid-off - and pitches the ball up on middle stump. Smith springs across and then, after teasing all of us with those rubber wrists, only defends. Boooo!;
10.5;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run gets across his stumps because he reads the short ball early and knows there's a sprawling gap at long leg. Good pull game plan. Good pull shot;
10.4;3;Boult to Smith, 3 runs goes round the stumps straight away to SS, who is only too happy to work with the angle and flick the fuller delivery from outside off down the ground past the right of the bowler;
10.3;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run goes for the magic ball, pitching leg and swinging away to take the leading edge. No such luck as Khawaja flicks the ball on the pads to deep square leg;
10.2;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run beats him again! This time with good old fashioned line and length outside off. Khawaja has this habit of reaching out away from his body - because he rarely moves his feet, especially forward. And that time there's just enough away movement to beat the edge;
10.1;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run bouncer which Khawaja tries to hook away, but he's gonna need a stepladder for that. The Lord's hospitality doesn't quite go that far;
9.6;?;Ferguson to Smith, no run length, and he defends this 145kph ball angling into him;
9.5;?;Ferguson to Smith, no run shorter, angles into him, and he defends this towards cover. 146kph!;
9.4;2;Ferguson to Smith, 2 runs full ball, and he drives this towards point. Able to get past the man there, but cover runs along and keeps it from reaching the boundary;
9.3;?;Ferguson to Smith, no run length, angles into him again, and he plays it away towards point;
9.2;?;Ferguson to Smith, no run length, jags into him, and he forces himself to come forward and just defend;
9.1;W;Ferguson to Warner, OUT short, and he has got Warner with a snorter! Delivered at 142kph, and following him as he looks to sway out of its way, this ball takes off and takes Warner along its way through to Latham. Ferguson had no doubt, and neither did Warner. Both openers dismissed this early, wow!;David Warner c ?Latham b Ferguson 16 (39m 23b 3x4 0x6) SR: 69.56;
8.6;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run full, and driven towards point;
8.5;2;Boult to Khawaja, 2 runs full, outside off, and he drives this just out of the reach of cover. They will get two as the fielder half-stops it;
8.4;4;Boult to Khawaja, FOUR runs full, on the pads, and he can tuck this away towards long leg. The man at deep backward square leg cannot get across to this;
8.3;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run throws this a bit wider, fuller, and he drives as it swings away from him. Goes straight to point;
8.2;2;Boult to Khawaja, 2 runs full, on the pads, and he flicks this past short midwicket. There's a man in the deep who will get to this on his right, but they will return for the second;
8.1;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run length, outside off, and he defends this to point;
7.6;?;de Grandhomme to Warner, no run length, and some extra bounce as he looks to defend. Immediately signals to the dressing room with his gloves. Would hope that is just for water, or drier gloves perhaps?;
7.5;?;de Grandhomme to Warner, no run length, angles across him, and he seems surprised by the lack of pace on this 125kph ball. Plays it on to his pads off the inside edge;
7.4;4;de Grandhomme to Warner, FOUR runs full, outside off, and he smashes this past mid off. Hit hard, but also placed well to the left of the man there;
7.3;1;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 run length, angling away, and he dabs this down to third man with soft hands;
7.2;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run shimmies across the crease to the off side, and CdG follows him, throwing it wide. He drives, but cover dives to his right and stops this;
7.1;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run length, angles across him, and he defends this towards point;
6.6;?;Boult to Warner, no run length, and he defends;
6.5;?;Boult to Warner, no run length, outside off, and he leaves;
6.4;4;Boult to Warner, FOUR runs short, and he picks it up from outside off and whips it towards deep square leg. Smart shot, as a little roll of the wrists kept it to the left of short midwicket;
6.3;?;Boult to Warner, no run length, honing in on off stump, and he defends;
6.2;2;Boult to Warner, 2 runs short, angles away from him, and gets big as he looks to cut! Just clears point, and trundles away towards the point fence. They are able to come back for two, but that was not far from Nicholls;
6.1;?;Boult to Warner, no run off-cutter, comes into him at 143kph from a length, and he fends it towards square leg;
5.6;2;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 2 runs full, but on the pads, and he can whip this off his legs towards deep midwicket. Ferguson does well to keep the scoring down to two;
5.5;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run length, angles away, and goes close to his gloves before nipping away through to Latham behind the wicket;
5.4;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run full, angles across him, and he again times a drive well, but cannot place it either side of mid off;
5.4;1w;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, 1 wide looks to go full, but goes down the leg side;
5.3;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run full, slanting across him, and he drives it to mid off;
5.2;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run length, outside off, and he drives to the left of mid off. Wants a single, but the fielder was quick to converge on this;
5.1;?;de Grandhomme to Khawaja, no run full, outside off, and he drives this to mid off;
4.6;?;Boult to Warner, no run thrown wide, and he cuts, but cannot beat point;
4.5;1;Boult to Khawaja, 1 run DROPPED! Full ball outside off, and Khawaja goes with the flow and has a dab at it, taking one hand off. It goes through to Guptill at the second of three slips, but he spills it as he falls;
4.4;?;Boult to Khawaja, no run length, outside off, and he defends;
4.3;W;Boult to Finch, OUT length, and jags back into him and traps him in front! Just a bit of seam movement back into him, and Finch shakes his head as he walks off. The umpire was fairly easily convinced that this would have hit the top of off and middle, and the Australia captain agreed. What a start for New Zealand!;Aaron Finch lbw b Boult 8 (19m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 53.33;
4.2;4;Boult to Finch, FOUR runs full, and he drives this straight back past Boult! Beats mid on with the placement, and the power on it has Boult dropping down to his right in a vain attempt at stopping that;
4.1;?;Boult to Finch, no run length, outside off, defended towards point;
3.6;?;de Grandhomme to Warner, no run full, and he comes forward in trying to drive this past cover. Finds the player there;
3.5;1lb;de Grandhomme to Finch, 1 leg bye full, on the pads, and he looks to whip it away on the on side. Off his pads towards square leg;
3.4;1;de Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run length, shapes into him, and he jams his bat down in time to play it away towards square leg;
3.3;?;de Grandhomme to Warner, no run full, and he throws his bat at this. Hits it hard, but cover stops this;
3.2;?;de Grandhomme to Warner, no run length, straighter, and tucks him up as he looks to play it on the onside, but misses out on contact;
3.1;1;de Grandhomme to Finch, 1 run wide outside off, and he throws his bat at this. Takes a bounce on its way down to third man;
2.6;4;Boult to Warner, FOUR runs full ball, on the pads, and he has whipped this off his pads, up the slope, through for four. Easy putaway in the end, because it didn't swing;

1.29pm Warner and Finch walk out to the middle. Warner will take strike, with two slips in place for Trent Boult. In fact, three slips now
Abhijato: "Speaking of Baker Street, my Crystal Ball is wearing its Holmes-inspired deerstalker already. Warner & Finch v Ferguson & Boult will participate in a classical opening overs contest, it says... Don't be late for the start, folks!"
Carey: "Still no room for Tom Blundell who performed so well in the warm up games and is one of the best NZ batsmen around spin bowling. When will his time come?"
SimonR: "Per your introduction - why is this an almost must win for NZ. They have 11 points.. Even if they lose their last two matches the possible alternatives of Bangladesh or Pakistan (even if England squeak through) can only get to 11 max and have a worse NRR. NZ are safe it is England at risk" --- Hence the emphasis on 'almost'. A heavy defeat today could put New Zealand in a bit of a tricky spot going into their final game too, remember
1.24pm The teams have walked down the Long Room on to the field, and we have the anthems on now
David: "Interesting stat - KW and Ross Taylor have identical ODI average coming into this game (48.12), hopefully they can both increase their averages today!" --- Could have a role to play too, if Australia get the kind of start they have been getting this World Cup
F May: "Keen for this one.Trans-tasman rivalry is decades old. Has been bitter at times too (think the underarm ball, Hadlee single handedly tormenting the Aussies, the years of Bevan's middle order runaways or NZ's recent rise). Here's hoping for an awesome contest!" --- Oh completely!
Kartik: "Does Baker Street really exist in London, as Miller claims?" --- It does, indeed, and I can verify from experience that a pleasant summer's day in London is the best time to take an absolutely long walk. By the way, Gerry Rafferty even composed a paen to Baker Street
There is a sound that echoes around Eden Park. A crack like lightning. The echo of a picture perfect straight drive... FOR SIX.
There is a sound that echoes around the MCG too. The roar of 100,000 fans as they watched a left-arm speed demon shatter those poor defenseless stumps.
These sounds will be haunting Lord's today. The home of cricket getting a taste of a rivalry that is more how do you do than how dare you. Sure, it's pretty awful timing for the fans back home considering it's the middle of the night in New Zealand and Australia right now. But at least it's the weekend. So come on. Pull out that phone. Text your mates. Call them over and have an all night cricket party. Doesn't actually sound like the worst thing in the world, does it? (Don't answer that)
PS - if you're absolutely gagging to know more about Henry Nicholls (and why wouldn't you be) Alagappan had a chat with him earlier this year on his rise as a red-ball cricketer

1.02pm Time for the toss: Australia have won the toss and will bat
Australia: Finch (c), Warner, Khawaja, Smith, Maxwell, Stoinis, Carey (wk), Cummins, Starc, Lyon, Behrendorff
New Zealand: Guptill. Nicholls, Williamson (c), Taylor, Latham (wk), Neesham, de Grandhomme, Santner, Sodhi, Ferguson, Boult
On the broadcast, Ian Smith reckons this will be a good pitch for chasing, and thinks it is a 300-pitch. Gaurav Sundararaman, meanwhile, pings me the scorecard for the only Day-Night match at Lord's before
Aaron Finch: "Hopefully later on slow up a little, and take a bit of spin. I think it's a difficult wicket from the previous one. No changes, everyone who contributed to the win has done really well. Everyone has played at some point, so it's going well."
Kane Williamson: ""We would have batted too. Two changes - Ish Sodhi comes in for Matt Henry, and also Henry Nicholls comes in for Colin Munro."
Must credit Francis Payne on Twitter for pointing this out initially, but this is New Zealand's first ever World Cup ODI at Lord's! Also their World Cup record against Australia is 3-7 heading into today
Yudhbir Yadav: "On 26th I had my civil service exam in Rajasthan (India) where there was a question about Horward Gardner's theory of Intelligence... And my intelligence was reading it as Alan Gardner's theory of Intelligence... #Cricket_fever..." --- Maybe you were just really, really, really, really looking forward to his insights on the #LiveReport
"Good morning all. Absolutely blistering at Lord's today. I speed-walked up from Baker Street and am now a very soggy puddle. Pitch has had a shave but still looks green-tinged. But with this heat, I wouldn't anticipate many demons surviving long into the match," is Andrew Miller's first contribution for this evening
"Ish Sodhi must play today, as well as Santer. This wicket has enough for the spinners too. Whoever wins the toss will bat first. 280 to 290 will be a challenging total in this wicket," is Ashish Das' early prophecy
Sriram: "Read Miller's article on how Finch's Australia have shed their aggression but not their winning ways. It led me to an interesting insight. AB's team was molded in his shape to be fighters. Taylor's and Waugh's teams were ruthless. Ponting's were world beaters just like him. Now they're being molded into Finchy's style. No outward aggression yet fighters and winner. " --- I did commentary on a few of Australia's games in India and UAE against Pakistan ahead of the World Cup, and you could see him growing into the role he's playing now with his team. For those that missed the article by any chance, it's right here
The first bit of good news - it's a bright and sunny afternoon in London. "Roasting...perfect weather for a barbie," says Alan Gardner, who will be in charge of the #LiveReport today for us. In the meantime, here's some good listening material for you to dive straight into. Pakistan have their 1992 parallels, England have been talking about the Cup coming home for a while now, Australia are Australia. Through all of it, India have quietly got to the doorsteps of the semi-final, (almost) without putting a foot wrong so far. Is it their World Cup to lose now? Our latest Talking World Cup podcast has more (and it's also on Apple Podcasts)
12.30pm Welcome to Lord's, for what should be a cracking 2015 final re-match between New Zealand and Australia. With Pakistan's resurgence in recent games, this is an almost-must win situation for the New Zealanders, who were unbeaten in the tournament until they ran into Sarfaraz Ahmed's team over this week. Lots to look forward to -- this is Debayan Sen, and Alagappan Muthu will join me in the course of this evening. Let's get you started with Andrew McGlashan's preview
 Innings Start
9.10pm Pakistan snuck in a thriller against Afghanistan, and this big win for Australia now means this is how the top four looks. For the moment, this is Debayan Sen saying goodnight on behalf of Alagappan Muthu and Chandan Duorah. England versus India in a few hours from now. Be there or be square, good folks. Tata...
Aaron Finch: "From 5 for 92, a great partnership from Alex Carey and Usman Khawaja on a wicket we knew would turn. I think it was important that we got some time in the middle, but not in the way we did. It was a difficult wicket to start on, and the way Alex came in and hit the ball was excellent. It was not easy to time the ball. (On bowling) You try to be some flexible and pitch some overs from part-timers in the middle. We have seen the value of wickets between overs 20-40. (de Grandhomme wicket) Yeah, there's been some discussion between JL, Smudgie and myself - great that it worked out."
Kane Williamson: "It was a fairly challenging surface. If you were willing to hit the wicket hard, there was something in it, and there was some up-and-down bounce as well. Lots of spin as well, and a lot of credit for the way they rebuilt their innings and got to a competitive total. Obviously, we were trying to get the matchups. I probably bowled a bit more than I should have, with the left-handers in the middle. Throughout the innings, we thought we had them under control, but Carey took the game away with a brilliant partnership. Some big lads hit the wicket hard and got something out of it. What we needed was one major 100+ partnership where we could soak up some pressure and turn the momentum our way. It wasn't to be today, and we have to pick ourselves up and move on. (For England) I guess we have to look at the surface and make the right decisions. We have an extra day off, and it would be nice to freshen up a little bit. The wickets haven't been what a lot of people thought - they are perhaps tired."
9.02pm Mohan: "If England goes through NZ will be the fourth team else Pakistan will be fourth. NZ's big wins against weak teams are helping them out." --- By all accounts, tomorrow sounds like it will be England versus Rest of the World. At least in terms of supporters?
9.00pm Rivlud: "It's a batsmen game when a high quality bowler like Mitchell Starc takes a 5 for and get's beaten to the MoM award, what a joke!" --- I would agree on most days. Today's game was pretty much impacted by Carey's batting. It just took New Zealand far away from the position of strength they found themselves in with the ball early on
Alex Carey is the player of the match, tells Simon Doull: "It wasn't the start we wanted. Uzi (Khawaja) was out there and for me it was to assess the conditions. There was lots of time to bat. It did play a little on the slower side, and they were bowling really well. I stuck to my strengths, to drive when it wasn't short. Credit to Usman Khawaja as well, and Starc with the bowler. I really enjoy my batting. Ideally in the last 10 overs, but I don't mind opportunities like this. (On the steepling catch) It was important to hold on to that, the blue skies don't help, and Ross (Taylor) was batting really well. We have to move to Manchester and play really well too."
Starc is the first bowler with three five-wicket hauls in World Cups
8.55pm New Zealand made the first cuts in this contest, especially with the new ball. There was turn on offer for Mitch Santner, and even Kane Williamson did pretty well with the ball. But the doggedness of Usman Khawaja and the enterprise of Alex Carey helped Australia post 243, which we thought would be a challenging total. It proves to be more than enough, as Australia never allowed New Zealand to get away at all. A scratchy innings from Kane Williamson in an otherwise dismal batting effort from the erstwhile league table toppers here at CWC19. They still need some work to do to qualify
43.4;W;Starc to Santner, OUT short, and he holes out to fine leg! Starc has five, and Australia have crushed New Zealand in an imposing performance where they were on the back foot for the first hour and a bit in this contest. Cricket, bloody hell! It was short and quick, and Santner actually got inside the line of the ball and was looking to hook this towards long leg. The pace on the ball took the top edge and made it go finer, and Behrendorff made no mistake;Mitchell Santner c Behrendorff b Starc 12 (42m 29b 0x4 1x6) SR: 41.37;
43.3;?;Starc to Santner, no run full ball, and he drives this towards cover;
43.2;?;Starc to Santner, no run full ball, and he looks to flick this down towards fine leg. Goes off the thigh, but he refuses a possible single;
43.1;?;Starc to Santner, no run length, fast, and he backs away and has a swing, and a miss...;
42.6;?;Lyon to Boult, no run comes down the wicket and has a mighty heave at it. Trickles down towards deep midwicket, and Santner refuses the single to take on Starc;
42.5;2;Lyon to Boult, 2 runs comes down the wicket and gets it towards long leg. They pick up two before the fielder there can come around to that position;
42.4;1;Lyon to Santner, 1 run tossed up, and he drives this through point;
42.3;4b;Lyon to Santner, 4 byes length, and he goes back and wants to pump this through midwicket. Gets close to the inside edge, and it beats Carey, the bat and the leg stump on its way through to the fine leg fence;
42.2;6;Lyon to Santner, SIX runs moves across and whacks this over deep backward square leg!;
42.1;?;Lyon to Santner, no run length, turns and stays low. Santner wants to drive this back, but it sneaks under his bat;

41.5;?;Starc to Boult, no run full, and he backs away again and gets it towards point;

41.3;?;Starc to Boult, no run short, and he backs away in trying to go down the ground, but misses out;
41.2;?;Starc to Boult, no run honing in on the off stump, but Boult gets his bat down on it on time;
41.1;W;Starc to Ferguson, OUT BOWLED HIM! Starc always attacks the stumps, and this time he was too quick and too accurate for Ferguson. Wicket no. 23 as he comes from wide of the crease, and Ferguson fails to get behind the line of this;Lockie Ferguson b Starc 0 (7m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
40.6;?;Lyon to Santner, no run length, and he cuts this away towards point;

40.3;1;Lyon to Santner, 1 run OH, WHAT A TRY! Santner sashays down the pitch and smacks it, trying to clear David Warner at mid on. Warner hops to his right, sticks his left hand out, and almost pulls off an absolute beauty!;
40.2;?;Lyon to Santner, no run tossed up, and he drives this towards covers;
40.1;?;Lyon to Santner, no run tossed up, and the extra bounce beats Santner!;
39.6;W;Starc to Sodhi, OUT shapes into him from wide of the crease, and he has been caught in front of the crease. Called leg-before, but they review this. Nothing wrong with the front foot, and there doesn't appear to be any bat on it either. The impact is fine, and the wickets stay with umpire's call. That's Starc now emulating his haul of wickets from 2015!;Ish Sodhi lbw b Starc 5 (11m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125;
39.6;1w;Starc to Sodhi, 1 wide length, down the leg side, and it goes through the keeper with Sodhi looking to play it down the leg side. Called a wide, but the bowler had a half-appeal. And Finch also considered a review briefly;
39.6;2w;Starc to Santner, 2 wide tries a short ball, but sprays it down the leg side, and will have to bowl this once again;
39.5;1;Starc to Sodhi, 1 run fires in a 149kph yorker, and Sodhi does well to get it away towards short midwicket;
39.4;1;Starc to Santner, 1 run fuller, but strays down the pads, and he flicks this away towards deep backward square leg;
39.3;?;Starc to Santner, no run full ball, and he punches this towards cover;
39.2;?;Starc to Santner, no run short, lifts away from outside off, and he takes the bat out of the line of that as it passes through to Carey;
39.1;?;Starc to Santner, no run length, angles into him, and he defends;
38.6;4;Lyon to Sodhi, FOUR runs length, and he lobs this over short fine leg. Dismissive from Sodhi!;

38.2;?;Lyon to Santner, no run tossed up, and he defends this outside off;
38.1;W;Lyon to Neesham, OUT swings across the line, and holes out to the bowler himself! Well, with the rise in required run-rate, this was always on the cards. Lyon flights one outside off, and Neesham tries to swing this across the line, and the top edge goes towards short midwicket. Lyon calls, and takes the catch himself;James Neesham c & b Lyon 9 (24m 22b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.9;
37.6;?;Starc to Santner, no run short, and he jumps to fend this right in front of his face. Seems to have hit part of his helmet, after rising off the glove. Short, and swift!;
37.5;?;Starc to Santner, no run full, and he shimmies across and flicks towards short midwicket. Had to scramble back as he was sent back! No direct hit, luckily for him, at the striker's end;
37.4;?;Starc to Santner, no run full, outside off, and he drives this but can only get it to cover;
37.3;1;Starc to Neesham, 1 run shorter length, angles into him, and he fends it down towards square leg;
37.2;?;Starc to Neesham, no run length, jags back into Neesham, who defends this towards point;
37.1;?;Starc to Neesham, no run length ball, just on off stump, and goes on with the angle as Neesham plays inside the line. Narrowly misses both the outside edge and the top of off!;
36.6;1;Lyon to Neesham, 1 run tossed up, and he punches this towards extra cover;
36.5;2;Lyon to Neesham, 2 runs tossed up, and he fetches this from outside off and drags it towards cow corner. NCN fielding there as a sub will cut it off;
36.4;1;Lyon to Santner, 1 run length, and he goes back and punches this out towards deep point;
36.3;?;Lyon to Santner, no run length, goes on with the arm, and Santner didn't read it! Goes back and almost chops it on to his stumps;
36.2;?;Lyon to Santner, no run presses forward to defend a length ball, tossed up on middle;
36.1;?;Lyon to Santner, no run length, and he goes back to punch this down towards the bowler;

35.4;?;Starc to Santner, no run length, outside off, and he lets this pass;
35.3;W;Starc to Latham, OUT WHAT A CATCH! Fuller ball, but Latham saw it and was eyeing the midwicket fence. Gets a good bit of the bat to it, and Superman Steve Smith flies away to his right and plucks it out with his right hand. Super stuff!;Tom Latham c Smith b Starc 14 (41m 28b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;

34.4;1;Maxwell to Neesham, 1 run flighted, and he can drive this to the right of mid on;
34.3;?;Maxwell to Neesham, no run turns again from a length, and he has to defend this back down the wicket;
34.2;?;Maxwell to Neesham, no run length, turns away sharply, and Neesham has to adjust late to defend this;

32.3;?;Smith to Neesham, no run off break again, now with a slip in place, and he defends;
32.2;1;Smith to Latham, 1 run bowls an off break, darting into him, and he flicks it away towards deep midwicket;
32.1;W;Smith to de Grandhomme, OUT STICKS AND STONES MIGHT HURT HIS BONES, BUT BOOS WILL GET HIM A WICKET! He loops one up outside off, and CdG has hit this high and straight down Khawaja's throat at wide long off. What a shame, off the first ball too! Wicket for Smith!;Colin de Grandhomme c Khawaja b Smith 0 (6m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

31.4;W;Cummins to Taylor, OUT RUNS OUT OF PATIENCE! Fuller ball, and he looks to go across the line and top-edges this behind the wicket. It hangs in the air forever but Carey positions himself well and takes it low down in front of him. What a time for Australia to get rid of Taylor!;Ross Taylor c ?Carey b Cummins 30 (76m 54b 2x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
31.3;1;Cummins to Latham, 1 run short, angles away from him, and he steers it down to third man;
31.2;1;Cummins to Taylor, 1 run length, angles into him and he plays it with soft hands towards square leg and picks up a single;
31.1;4;Cummins to Taylor, FOUR runs short, and he swings this around the dial to bissect the gap between fine leg and deep backward square leg. 1000 runs against Australia for Taylor;
30.6;1;Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run turned around the corner with the little turn into him towards deep midwicket;
30.5;1;Maxwell to Latham, 1 run intent shown, comes down the track and tries to drive him down the ground. Bat skews in his hand and goes toward midwicket;
30.4;1;Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run reverse sweeps a length ball, and goes off the top edge of the back of the bat, but lands short of the fielder at point;
30.3;?;Maxwell to Taylor, no run length, and he drives it back toward the bowler;
30.2;?;Maxwell to Taylor, no run full, outside off, and he misses out on a dab down to third man;
30.1;1;Maxwell to Latham, 1 run fired in straight, and he flicks it away towards deep backward square leg;
29.6;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run kicks off a length and Taylor is almost fearing a hit to his head. Just about gets the bat high up to knock the ball down to the leg side;
29.5;1;Cummins to Latham, 1 run looks like an offcutter that grips and moves away from the left-hander. Latham is a bit squared up as he steers to third man;
29.4;?;Cummins to Latham, no run good length on off stump, he defends;
29.3;?;Cummins to Latham, no run back of a length and outside off, defends;
29.2;?;Cummins to Latham, no run goes to pull a ball that isn't short enough or wide enough and ends up looking very very awkward. Not to mention the hit to his body;
29.1;?;Cummins to Latham, no run mis-hit as Latham brings his bat across, looking for a run through midwicket, but instead gets a bit of a leading edge to cover;
28.6;1;Lyon to Latham, 1 run goes back to the length ball, opening up his hips so the bat can come down on top of the ball for a single to square leg;
28.5;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run direct hit, has Latham made it?. Ohh this is tight. And he just about gets in. Good dive. Full length. Bat grounded. Well done. So Taylor's little nudge to Maxwell is good enough;
28.4;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run full and outside off, drives back to the bowler;
28.3;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run top edge but it doesn't carry to short fine leg. There's the danger playing the sweep to an offspinner that is known for his turn and bounce;
28.2;1;Lyon to Latham, 1 run short and wide, Latham slaps it past the right of cover;
28.1;?;Lyon to Latham, no run tosses it up on off stump, defends;
27.6;?;Starc to Taylor, no run looks for that deadly yorker - only this one's a mere 143 kph and well outside off - Taylor bunts it to cover point;
27.5;1;Starc to Latham, 1 run rides the bounce nicely and steers the 149 kph delivery outside off to third man;
27.4;?;Starc to Latham, no run leading edge as Starc dials down the pace to a gentle 140 kph and has the batsman flicking through midwicket way too early.;
27.3;?;Starc to Latham, no run 148kph, goes for the bouncer on middle but Latham is happy to stand behind it and block;
27.2;?;Starc to Latham, no run good length, outside off, no shot;
27.1;?;Starc to Latham, no run 150kph back of a length and outside off, blocks to cover point;
26.6;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run oooh, the dip ruins the drive. How often does Lyon do that. He lures the right-hander into driving against the turn, through the off side. And then dupes them in the air. Here the ball drops on Taylor, massively, and gets his inside edge onto pad;
26.5;1;Lyon to Latham, 1 run works a tossed up ball on off stump, against the turn, to deep midwicket;
26.4;?;Lyon to Latham, no run good length ball outside off, no shot;
26.3;2;Lyon to Latham, 2 runs goes for the sweep and makes good enough connection for a couple to fine leg;
26.2;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run full and outside off, he smears it to the sweeper.;
26.1;1;Lyon to Latham, 1 run closes the face too early and gets a leading edge through cover point. Gorgeous bowling from Lyon, round the wicket, drifting it into the left-hander and getting it to turn away, sharply;
25.6;1;Starc to Latham, 1 run flicks the full, inswinging delivery at 152 kph to deep square leg;
25.5;?;Starc to Latham, no run 145 kph and it's coming at his throat. Latham tries to lift it over midwicket but he is far far too slow with the shot;
25.4;W;Starc to Williamson, OUT caught behind. One genius gets the other! And it's that dab. It's the go to shot. It's the one that feeds every one of his ODI innings. But not this one. The ball angling across the right hander - a cutter set up for the fourth slip - takes the edge as KW plays the dab and goes through to the keeper. Australia celebrate. Starc celebrates although should he reallly? He keeps taking so many wickets in his first over of a new spell that maybe he should just yawn and wave bye-bye to the other guy;Kane Williamson c ?Carey b Starc 40 (69m 51b 2x4 1x6) SR: 78.43;
25.3;2;Starc to Williamson, 2 runs 151kph, tucks a fullish delivery on leg stump through midwicket and they scurry across for the second as well.;
25.2;2;Starc to Williamson, 2 runs slaps the short and wide delivery at 147 kph right through point, the timing good enough to draw the mistake from the fielder;
25.1;1;Starc to Taylor, 1 run turns the length ball on leg stump through square leg;
24.6;?;Maxwell to Williamson, no run taps it towards point;
24.5;4;Maxwell to Williamson, FOUR runs over mid-off and into the boundary. Sure the ball is turning into him, but he gets a good stride going and there's plenty of width to free the arms;
24.4;?;Maxwell to Williamson, no run defends a tossed up delivery outside off. Maxi's getting lovely drift now.;
24.3;1;Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run;
24.2;1;Maxwell to Williamson, 1 run plenty of flight, luring KW into a hard-hit cover drive that bursts through the hands at short cover to bring up 6000 ODI runs. The third fastest to the mark, three innings behind Kohli;
24.1;1;Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run looms over the tossed up ball outside off and flicks it through midwicket;
23.6;?;Stoinis to Williamson, no run chops the back of a length ball to the right of the keeper;
23.5;2;Stoinis to Williamson, 2 runs bottom edge scurries away past the right of the keeper. Williamson is trying the punch through cover but he's happy for the two nonetheless;
23.4;?;Stoinis to Williamson, no run back of a length and outside off, dabs it behind point;
23.3;6;Stoinis to Williamson, SIX runs lifts it over deep midwicket. A length ball on leg stump and Williamson decides to show off a bit. Sure I could have nudged it along the ground to square leg. Buuuuuut.... I'd rather hit the first six of the day. There! Boom!;
23.2;?;Stoinis to Williamson, no run inside edge onto his boot as he tries to dab the ball to third man;
23.1;?;Stoinis to Williamson, no run stands tall behind a shortish delivery outside off and turns it to mid-on;
22.6;2;Maxwell to Taylor, 2 runs lovely placement. Taylor plants the ball between midwicket and deep square leg with a simple nudge off the pads and his partner is awake to the second run;
22.5;1;Maxwell to Williamson, 1 run spots the length early, goes back and waits for the ball to turn, and only then does he tap it through square leg for a simple single;
22.4;1;Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run nudges a full ball on the pads behind square leg;
22.3;?;Maxwell to Taylor, no run quicker through the air but still very full on off stump. Taylor works it to midwicket. Pressure keeps building;
22.2;?;Maxwell to Taylor, no run gently pats the flighted delivery on off stump into the off side;
22.1;?;Maxwell to Taylor, no run tosses it up on off stump, Taylor pushes it back down the pitch;
21.6;1;Stoinis to Taylor, 1 run gets it to dart away - the legcutter gripping off the pitch - and Taylor follows the ball, steering it to third man with soft hands .Still risky though. A little extra bounce and he could have been caught behind;
21.5;?;Stoinis to Taylor, no run opens the face as he meets a shortish ball outside off, looking for a single to third man, but backward point hasn't been clued in on that plan;
21.4;1;Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run slinks across his stumps to bully a good length ball outside off into the hands of deep square leg;
21.3;?;Stoinis to Williamson, no run blocks a back of a length delivery on off stump;
21.2;2;Stoinis to Williamson, 2 runs misfield at midwicket - Carey, I think - and it allows Williamson to sneak a second after a well played tap, right under his eyes;
21.1;1lb;Stoinis to Taylor, 1 leg bye shapes to pull the back of a length ball on leg stump but it doesn't quite come on and he mistimes it to the left of the keeper;
20.6;1;Finch to Taylor, 1 run full on middle, drives to long-off;
20.5;4;Finch to Taylor, FOUR runs sweeps past short fine leg, the desperate dive doesn't work and New Zealand get a little bit of relief. Poor ball well down leg. Simple putaway, no fuss. And on we go;
20.4;?;Finch to Taylor, no run steps down the pitch to try and whip the ball against the turn through midwicket, but turn is what Finch does, beating the closed face and hitting his pad;
20.3;?;Finch to Taylor, no run defends a flatter delivery on middle stump. Getting just a little grip is the Aussie captain;
20.2;1;Finch to Williamson, 1 run loads up the sweep as the ball slides into leg stump. Plays too early and cue-ends the ball towards midwicket;
20.1;1;Finch to Taylor, 1 run steps down the track to drive a tossed up ball to long-on;
19.6;1;Behrendorff to Taylor, 1 run length, and he cuts it down to third man;
19.5;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run fuller ball, and slower through the air again at just 120kph, and he plays it towards mid on;
19.4;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run slower ball, traps him on the pads as he shuffles across. Not given leg before, and Australia seem to believe that could have pitched outside leg. Another off-cutter;
19.3;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run length ball, defends towards short midwicket;
19.2;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run length, and straight along the line across from leg to off, and he has to block this;
19.2;1w;Behrendorff to Taylor, 1 wide slower ball, but sprays it down the leg side;
19.1;1;Behrendorff to Williamson, 1 run length, angling away, and he dabs it down towards third man;
19.1;1w;Behrendorff to Williamson, 1 wide short, and too short according to the umpires. Also slanted away from him;
18.6;1;Smith to Williamson, 1 run tossed up more, and he drives it well enough to get it past cover;
18.5;1;Smith to Taylor, 1 run another full toss, another shot straight to the sweeper deep on the off side;
18.4;1;Smith to Williamson, 1 run full toss again, and he drives this towards deep point. Great stuff from Starc there;
18.3;?;Smith to Williamson, no run flatter, pitches around leg and strikes him on the pad. Didn't turn back in enough, and probably also pitched outside leg;
18.2;1;Smith to Taylor, 1 run full toss, and he smacks it out towards sweeper cover;
18.1;?;Smith to Taylor, no run tossed up, and turns away from him. Beats the outside edge as he tries to drive;
17.6;1;Behrendorff to Taylor, 1 run length, angles into him and he plays it towards square leg;
17.5;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run length, angles across and he defends this towards point;
17.4;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run slower ball again, angles across Taylor, who reads it and defends this to point;
17.3;1;Behrendorff to Williamson, 1 run DROPPED! Difficult chance through to Carey. This one from Behrendorff was an off-cutter, and moved away from Williamson, who chased it through. Off the toe-end, and dying on Carey, who gets a bit of a finger on it as it runs away from him towards third man;
17.2;?;Behrendorff to Williamson, no run length, jags back into him, and he drops it right by his eyes. Caught by surprise by a bit of extra bounce in that!;
17.1;2;Behrendorff to Williamson, 2 runs length, outside off, and he lashes this through covers. The sweeper will cut it off ahead of the fence, out to his right;
16.6;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run quicker, straighter, and he defends this towards point;
16.5;1;Lyon to Williamson, 1 run looks to sweep from outside off, and paddles it down towards fine leg. Risky, but effective!;
16.4;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run tossed up, and he flicks this from outside off, with the turn, but cannot beat short midwicket;
16.3;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run tossed up, and he defends this outside his off stump;
16.2;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run turn into him from a length, and he flicks this down towards fine leg;
16.1;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run tossed up, and holds its line, and beats the outside edge;
15.6;1;Behrendorff to Taylor, 1 run length, on his pads, and he flicks this off his hips towards long leg;
15.5;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run fuller, and he drives but skews it a bit as it ends up going back off the inside of the bat back towards Behrendorff;

15.3;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run length, and he drops it dead at his feet;
15.2;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run length and he defends outside off. Goes off towards point;
15.1;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run length, straightens into him, and he drives it back to the bowler;
14.6;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run DROPPED? Tossed up outside off, and he saw his chance to drive against the turn. May have taken a bit of the bat, and part of Carey's right pad through to first slip, where the fielder fails to hold on. Steve Smith in position there;
14.5;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run outside off, and he looks to defend this towards point. Very feeble touch, along the ground, fielded by slip;
14.4;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run length, turns into him, and he flicks this towards short midwicket;
14.3;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run fuller, and he pulls out the sweep. A fielder in the deep for that, and he runs to his right and sends in a flat return;
14.2;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run length, turns into him, and comes off his pads and pops up. Lands short of short leg anyway;
14.1;1;Lyon to Williamson, 1 run tossed up, and he taps it to the right of point and picks up a single;
13.6;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run fuller, and he drives it back, but Behrendorff fields;
13.5;1lb;Behrendorff to Williamson, 1 leg bye fuller, on the pads, and he tries to flick this towards long leg. Came off the thigh pad!;
13.4;?;Behrendorff to Williamson, no run a little short, and he jumps and tries to flick this away towards fine leg. Hits him on the thigh pad and drops at the wicket;
13.3;?;Behrendorff to Williamson, no run length, nips away after pitching outside off, and he drops his wrists and sees it through to the keeper;
13.2;1;Behrendorff to Taylor, 1 run length ball, angles across him, flies off the shoulder of the bat towards third man!;
13.1;W;Behrendorff to Guptill, OUT full ball, angles into him, and given out leg before! Guptill chooses to walk. A bit of swing as it comes back into him. He gets his front foot around in front and cannot bring his bat down on time as he overbalances a touch. Behrendorff strikes again by bowling full. This is a vital breakthrough for the Australians;Martin Guptill lbw b Behrendorff 20 (60m 43b 2x4 0x6) SR: 46.51;
12.6;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run fuller, angles into him, and he plays this with a dead bat towards Finch at short leg;
12.5;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run fuller, a bit quicker at 88kph, and he goes back and defends this;

12.3;1;Lyon to Guptill, 1 run gets down on one knee and slaps a length ball down towards long leg;
12.2;1;Lyon to Williamson, 1 run fuller, angles across him, and he flicks it past short leg towards square leg;
12.1;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run length ball, turns in, and he defends from the crease;
11.6;1;Behrendorff to Williamson, 1 run length, straight, and he ticks it over towards deep midwicket this time;
11.5;1;Behrendorff to Guptill, 1 run fuller, angles across him, and he plays it past Maxwell at point and they get through for a comfortable single. Would have taken him on anyway, as that was travelling to his right;
11.4;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run fuller, angling across him, and he drives it towards mid off;
11.3;1;Behrendorff to Williamson, 1 run length, and he drops it with a dead bat and responds to Guptill's call for a quick single before point can swoop in on that;
11.2;?;Behrendorff to Williamson, no run length, angles across him, and he defends;
11.1;4;Behrendorff to Williamson, FOUR runs length, outside off, and he just stands up tall and punches this towards extra cover. Beautiful!;
10.6;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run length, hits the pitch really hard, and he presses forward to defend this;
10.5;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run short, and angles into him as it goes through to Carey. A half-appeal...may have just brushed his hip;
10.4;1;Cummins to Williamson, 1 run length, outside off, and he is able to run a 144kph ball down towards third man;
10.3;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run jaffa! A good length, just outside off, and moves away a touch off the seam, and goes past his outside edge as he looks to defend;
10.2;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run length, outside off, and he taps it down with a typical KW dead bat;
10.1;1;Cummins to Guptill, 1 run length ball, angles in, and he plays it away towards square leg;
9.6;?;Behrendorff to Williamson, no run ignores a ripe delivery on off stump, perfect for the on the up drive, and also for the nick behind. Ooooh, this is tense;
9.5;?;Behrendorff to Williamson, no run good length on off stump, defends;
9.4;2;Behrendorff to Williamson, 2 runs looks for the lbw with a pitched up ball on off stump. Williamson though is so very good at making sure that front leg never goes across. It only ever stays beside the line of the ball so he can bring down a straight bat, which in this case helps an inside edge scurry away through square leg;
9.3;?;Behrendorff to Williamson, no run back of a length and darting away outside off. He lets it go;
9.2;W;Behrendorff to Nicholls, OUT strangled down leg. And he's walking off. A poor end to what looked like a promising innings as he tries to pull a short ball down to fine leg but in the end only gloves the ball through to the keeper;Henry Nicholls c ?Carey b Behrendorff 8 (43m 20b 2x4 0x6) SR: 40;
9.1;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run beautyyyyyy. Kisses the deck on middle and nips away from the bat, whistling over the off stump as it goes to the keeper.;
8.6;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run fluent drive to mid-off, Guptill daring to put a little bit of his power into this shot because it's an overpitched delivery on middle;
8.5;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run defends a good length ball outside off towards point;
8.4;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run full and curling into him. Guptill keeps his bat straight and pushes to mid-on;
8.3;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run another bouncer this time angled into the right-hander. Guptill evades it;
8.2;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run that was there! It was there for the Marty G slap over point. And he does go for it, backing away and giving it his all. But the Cummins bouncer beats him for pace;
8.1;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run solid defensive push from Guptill, into the covers;
7.6;1;Behrendorff to Guptill, 1 run he almost falls over himself because of the late inswing, but because he is switched on, he's able to flick the ball on leg stump away through midwicket. NZ know they're in a fight. They know these first few overs are the biggest threat.;
7.5;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run pitches it up and tests both edges of the bat. Guptill is good enough to plant the middle of it on the ball though;
7.4;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run definite movement at this end for Behrendorff, Another lbw ball, pitching on middle and leg and nipping in at the right-hander. Guptill this time is able to get an inside edge;
7.3;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run good length and outside off, taps it towards point;
7.2;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run fullish and outside off, defends;
7.1;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run huuuge appeal for lbw as Behrendorff gets one to pitch on leg stump and nip in just the slightest bit. Guptill is caught with his front foot in the wrong place. The bat needs to come down around it and it can't make the journey in time. Australia think about the review, but they don;t go for it in the end. Worried about it going down leg, was Behrendorff and so Finch didn't go for it. Replays show it would have been umpire's call on hitting the stumps;
6.6;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run fullish on off stump, defends to cover;
6.5;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run pins him on the pad as Cummins gets his line perfect with the indipper. But it might just have been too high. Certainly was too quick for him as he gets his front leg too far across and gets caught with the bat having to come around it;
6.4;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run bouncer which is allowed to climb over Nicholls' shoulder and go through to the keeper. Good stuff from Nicholls. Looks like he belongs. In a World Cup game. Against Australia.;
6.3;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run good leave. Relies on that a lot in Test cricket. And here too, he covers the stumps to be safe from the ball nipping back in, which in this case is wise because it does just that;
6.2;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run gets just enough movement away from the bat as Nicholls steps forward to defend a fuller delivery on off stump. Bit of an outside edge to point;
6.1;1;Cummins to Guptill, 1 run 144 kph on a good length and outside off. Guptill lets it run off the outside half of the bat to third man;
5.6;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run 147kph, full on off stump, Nicholls brings that bat down well in time;
5.5;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run 154 kph scorcher!. Could be the fastest ball of the Cup. But he picks the line early and lets go a good length ball outside off.;
5.4;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run off the shoulder of the bat to point as Nicholls tries to get on top of a rising delivery on off stump. The only problem is it keeps rising.;
5.4;1w;Starc to Nicholls, 1 wide bouncer on off stump, lets it go, ump says it's too high;
5.3;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run 146 kph - no one bowls a full delivery at the stumps like Starc. That curl away when the ball leaves his hand. The curl in as it travels the pitch. Nicholls is aware of the danger and is playing with as straight a bat as possible;
5.2;4;Starc to Nicholls, FOUR runs that's his shot. The flick off the hips. He plays it with his eyes closed and with one hand making the Spock sign. Too straight. Touch too short. Simply put away;
5.1;4;Starc to Nicholls, FOUR runs beautiful straight drive. Made all the more better by the fact the speedgun says this is 153 kph. Nicholls gets in line and presents the full face so that a ball looking to take over his stumps instead crashes into the boundary boards;
4.6;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run touch too straight and the batsman is able to work it to square leg;
4.5;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run strong push into the covers, but that infield is definitely packed;
4.4;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run un-play-ABLE! Guptill recoils from a ball that pitches on off stump, back of a length, one he thinks he has covered with a back foot block but one that nips away off the pitch like it's nobody's business;
4.3;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run 137kph, punches the short if a length delivery outside off to point;
4.2;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run goes back in his crease to block the 134 kph short ball on middle;
4.1;4;Cummins to Guptill, FOUR runs strays on the pads and Guptill does the most decent thing that ball deserved. An all-expenses paid trip to the fine leg boundary;
3.6;1lb;Starc to Guptill, 1 leg bye half an appeal from Starc as he gets a length ball to curl back into Guptill at pace. The right-hander is trapped. His front foot is too far across and he doesn't have the time to adjust. Only height saves him. These are nervy times.;
3.5;?;Starc to Guptill, no run keeps out a good length ball at 147 kph looking for middle and leg stump. Who wants to be an opening batsman, eh?;
3.4;?;Starc to Guptill, no run back of a length and outside off, no need to bother with those. Just wave to the 152 kph white thing flying by;
3.4;1w;Starc to Guptill, 1 wide goes searching for that inswinging delivery to take out Guptill's stumps. But the 145 kph veers off target;
3.3;?;Starc to Guptill, no run dangles it outside off. Guptill won't bite;
3.2;?;Starc to Guptill, no run gets it to hold its line at 151kph and Guptill does well, watching the ball all the way, getting squared up a touch so he can defend a ball pitching leg and moving away;
3.1;?;Starc to Guptill, no run onto him too quickly as he tries to flick the back of a length ball on middle behind square leg. Beaten for (142kph) pace;
2.6;3;Behrendorff to Guptill, 3 runs hints of movement into the right-hander but Guptill is able to nudge it between midwicket and mid-on. Good connection because he wasn't trying to hit it too hard;
2.6;1w;Behrendorff to Guptill, 1 wide bowler overcompensates for the mistake and goes down the leg side;
2.5;4;Behrendorff to Guptill, FOUR runs screams away through the covers. Guptill gets the room to free his arms and he's calm enough to slap it through the gap;
2.4;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run very tight lines from Behrendorff. Guptill gets forward and defends a ball heading on to off stump;
2.3;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run pitches it right up there, almost on yorker length, Guptill drives to cover;
2.2;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run good length on off stump, Guptill keeps it out. Hmm. Might be jumping the gun but Behrendorff isn't getting much movement. And he's known for that;
2.1;2;Behrendorff to Guptill, 2 runs crunches the back of a length delivery outside off behind point.;
1.6;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run dangerous ball! It's the one that he slings out towards the off side but in mid-air it curls back into the left-hander. Essentially the same one Stokes got. Except it isn't a yorker and perhaps that's why Nicholls is able to block it from crashing into his sticks;
1.5;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run slants into the pads at 152 kph and Nicholls, shuffling across his stumps, is hit on his pads. Would have gone down though;
1.4;1;Starc to Guptill, 1 run good stuff, Guppy! Waits for the short ball outside off, taps it gently on top of the bounce and says, Henry, you deal with Starc;
1.3;?;Starc to Guptill, no run should I leave, should I play? Should I even try? This is testing bowling from Australia's strike weapon. He gets his radar perfect. On and around off stump and that last ball jagging back so far is still playing on Guptill's head as he steps forward to play something in between a leave and a block;
1.2;?;Starc to Guptill, no run cuts back in! Like a left-arm legbreak! Hits on and around off stump and then veers into Guptill, who is thinking he has an easy leave and in the end is struck on the thigh;
1.1;?;Starc to Guptill, no run starts with a short ball across the right-hander at 143 kph. Keeps the slips interested. Not the batsman though;
0.6;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run covers the line well and, it seems, he's started to move his feet as well. Gets across to off stump to get behind the short ball;
0.5;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run stands up nice and tall behind the shortish delivery on off stump and blunts it;
0.4;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run half a shout for lbw as Nicholls is stuck in his crease against one that nips back into him off a length. Miiiiiight just be too high;
0.3;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run looks for the flick through square leg but ends up with a welt on his thigh (probably);
0.2;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run nicely behind the 132 kph delivery looking for the top of off stump;
0.1;1;Behrendorff to Guptill, 1 run sweetly timed to the left of mid-off. Good signs for Guptill, who sometimes seems suspect against left-arm quicks because of the ball coming back in. This one though just pitches on a length and carries on with the angle, allowing him to play that favourite on the up drive;
43.4;W;Starc to Santner, OUT short, and he holes out to fine leg! Starc has five, and Australia have crushed New Zealand in an imposing performance where they were on the back foot for the first hour and a bit in this contest. Cricket, bloody hell! It was short and quick, and Santner actually got inside the line of the ball and was looking to hook this towards long leg. The pace on the ball took the top edge and made it go finer, and Behrendorff made no mistake;Mitchell Santner c Behrendorff b Starc 12 (42m 29b 0x4 1x6) SR: 41.37;
43.3;?;Starc to Santner, no run full ball, and he drives this towards cover;
43.2;?;Starc to Santner, no run full ball, and he looks to flick this down towards fine leg. Goes off the thigh, but he refuses a possible single;
43.1;?;Starc to Santner, no run length, fast, and he backs away and has a swing, and a miss...;
42.6;?;Lyon to Boult, no run comes down the wicket and has a mighty heave at it. Trickles down towards deep midwicket, and Santner refuses the single to take on Starc;
42.5;2;Lyon to Boult, 2 runs comes down the wicket and gets it towards long leg. They pick up two before the fielder there can come around to that position;
42.4;1;Lyon to Santner, 1 run tossed up, and he drives this through point;
42.3;4b;Lyon to Santner, 4 byes length, and he goes back and wants to pump this through midwicket. Gets close to the inside edge, and it beats Carey, the bat and the leg stump on its way through to the fine leg fence;
42.2;6;Lyon to Santner, SIX runs moves across and whacks this over deep backward square leg!;
42.1;?;Lyon to Santner, no run length, turns and stays low. Santner wants to drive this back, but it sneaks under his bat;
41.6;?;Starc to Boult, no run full, backs away and gets an inside edge towards fine leg. Carey stops it;
41.5;?;Starc to Boult, no run full, and he backs away again and gets it towards point;
41.4;?;Starc to Boult, no run full, and he backs away again, but can get some bat on it. Plays it back towards Starc, who takes it on the bounce over his left shoulder;
41.3;?;Starc to Boult, no run short, and he backs away in trying to go down the ground, but misses out;
41.2;?;Starc to Boult, no run honing in on the off stump, but Boult gets his bat down on it on time;
41.1;W;Starc to Ferguson, OUT BOWLED HIM! Starc always attacks the stumps, and this time he was too quick and too accurate for Ferguson. Wicket no. 23 as he comes from wide of the crease, and Ferguson fails to get behind the line of this;Lockie Ferguson b Starc 0 (7m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
40.6;?;Lyon to Santner, no run length, and he cuts this away towards point;
40.6;2w;Lyon to Ferguson, 2 wide big turn, from outside off, across the batsman, and past Carey as well. Called a wide;
40.5;?;Lyon to Ferguson, no run length ball, defended to point;
40.4;?;Lyon to Ferguson, no run presses forward to defend a length ball;
40.3;1;Lyon to Santner, 1 run OH, WHAT A TRY! Santner sashays down the pitch and smacks it, trying to clear David Warner at mid on. Warner hops to his right, sticks his left hand out, and almost pulls off an absolute beauty!;
40.2;?;Lyon to Santner, no run tossed up, and he drives this towards covers;
40.1;?;Lyon to Santner, no run tossed up, and the extra bounce beats Santner!;
39.6;W;Starc to Sodhi, OUT shapes into him from wide of the crease, and he has been caught in front of the crease. Called leg-before, but they review this. Nothing wrong with the front foot, and there doesn't appear to be any bat on it either. The impact is fine, and the wickets stay with umpire's call. That's Starc now emulating his haul of wickets from 2015!;Ish Sodhi lbw b Starc 5 (11m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125;
39.6;1w;Starc to Sodhi, 1 wide length, down the leg side, and it goes through the keeper with Sodhi looking to play it down the leg side. Called a wide, but the bowler had a half-appeal. And Finch also considered a review briefly;
39.6;2w;Starc to Santner, 2 wide tries a short ball, but sprays it down the leg side, and will have to bowl this once again;
39.5;1;Starc to Sodhi, 1 run fires in a 149kph yorker, and Sodhi does well to get it away towards short midwicket;
39.4;1;Starc to Santner, 1 run fuller, but strays down the pads, and he flicks this away towards deep backward square leg;
39.3;?;Starc to Santner, no run full ball, and he punches this towards cover;

38.2;?;Lyon to Santner, no run tossed up, and he defends this outside off;
38.1;W;Lyon to Neesham, OUT swings across the line, and holes out to the bowler himself! Well, with the rise in required run-rate, this was always on the cards. Lyon flights one outside off, and Neesham tries to swing this across the line, and the top edge goes towards short midwicket. Lyon calls, and takes the catch himself;James Neesham c & b Lyon 9 (24m 22b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.9;
37.6;?;Starc to Santner, no run short, and he jumps to fend this right in front of his face. Seems to have hit part of his helmet, after rising off the glove. Short, and swift!;
37.5;?;Starc to Santner, no run full, and he shimmies across and flicks towards short midwicket. Had to scramble back as he was sent back! No direct hit, luckily for him, at the striker's end;
37.4;?;Starc to Santner, no run full, outside off, and he drives this but can only get it to cover;
37.3;1;Starc to Neesham, 1 run shorter length, angles into him, and he fends it down towards square leg;
37.2;?;Starc to Neesham, no run length, jags back into Neesham, who defends this towards point;
37.1;?;Starc to Neesham, no run length ball, just on off stump, and goes on with the angle as Neesham plays inside the line. Narrowly misses both the outside edge and the top of off!;
36.6;1;Lyon to Neesham, 1 run tossed up, and he punches this towards extra cover;
36.5;2;Lyon to Neesham, 2 runs tossed up, and he fetches this from outside off and drags it towards cow corner. NCN fielding there as a sub will cut it off;
36.4;1;Lyon to Santner, 1 run length, and he goes back and punches this out towards deep point;
36.3;?;Lyon to Santner, no run length, goes on with the arm, and Santner didn't read it! Goes back and almost chops it on to his stumps;

35.4;?;Starc to Santner, no run length, outside off, and he lets this pass;
35.3;W;Starc to Latham, OUT WHAT A CATCH! Fuller ball, but Latham saw it and was eyeing the midwicket fence. Gets a good bit of the bat to it, and Superman Steve Smith flies away to his right and plucks it out with his right hand. Super stuff!;Tom Latham c Smith b Starc 14 (41m 28b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;

32.1;W;Smith to de Grandhomme, OUT STICKS AND STONES MIGHT HURT HIS BONES, BUT BOOS WILL GET HIM A WICKET!

31.4;W;Cummins to Taylor, OUT RUNS OUT OF PATIENCE! Fuller ball, and he looks to go across the line and top-edges this behind the wicket.

What a time for Australia to get rid of Taylor!;Ross Taylor c ?Carey b Cummins 30 (76m 54b 2x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
31.3;1;Cummins to Latham, 1 run short, angles away from him, and he steers it down to third man;

31.1;4;Cummins to Taylor, FOUR runs short, and he swings this around the dial to bissect the gap between fine leg and deep backward square leg. 1000 runs against Australia for Taylor;
30.6;1;Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run turned around the corner with the little turn into him towards deep midwicket;
30.5;1;Maxwell to Latham, 1 run intent shown, comes down the track and tries to drive him down the ground. Bat skews in his hand and goes toward midwicket;

30.1;1;Maxwell to Latham, 1 run fired in straight, and he flicks it away towards deep backward square leg;
29.6;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run kicks off a length and Taylor is almost fearing a hit to his head. Just about gets the bat high up to knock the ball down to the leg side;
29.5;1;Cummins to Latham, 1 run looks like an offcutter that grips and moves away from the left-hander. Latham is a bit squared up as he steers to third man;
29.4;?;Cummins to Latham, no run good length on off stump, he defends;
29.3;?;Cummins to Latham, no run back of a length and outside off, defends;
29.2;?;Cummins to Latham, no run goes to pull a ball that isn't short enough or wide enough and ends up looking very very awkward. Not to mention the hit to his body;
29.1;?;Cummins to Latham, no run mis-hit as Latham brings his bat across, looking for a run through midwicket, but instead gets a bit of a leading edge to cover;
28.6;1;Lyon to Latham, 1 run goes back to the length ball, opening up his hips so the bat can come down on top of the ball for a single to square leg;
28.5;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run direct hit, has Latham made it?. Ohh this is tight. And he just about gets in. Good dive. Full length. Bat grounded. Well done. So Taylor's little nudge to Maxwell is good enough;
28.4;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run full and outside off, drives back to the bowler;
28.3;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run top edge but it doesn't carry to short fine leg. There's the danger playing the sweep to an offspinner that is known for his turn and bounce;
28.2;1;Lyon to Latham, 1 run short and wide, Latham slaps it past the right of cover;
28.1;?;Lyon to Latham, no run tosses it up on off stump, defends;
27.6;?;Starc to Taylor, no run looks for that deadly yorker - only this one's a mere 143 kph and well outside off - Taylor bunts it to cover point;
27.5;1;Starc to Latham, 1 run rides the bounce nicely and steers the 149 kph delivery outside off to third man;
27.4;?;Starc to Latham, no run leading edge as Starc dials down the pace to a gentle 140 kph and has the batsman flicking through midwicket way too early.;
27.3;?;Starc to Latham, no run 148kph, goes for the bouncer on middle but Latham is happy to stand behind it and block;
27.2;?;Starc to Latham, no run good length, outside off, no shot;
27.1;?;Starc to Latham, no run 150kph back of a length and outside off, blocks to cover point;
26.6;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run oooh, the dip ruins the drive. How often does Lyon do that. He lures the right-hander into driving against the turn, through the off side. And then dupes them in the air. Here the ball drops on Taylor, massively, and gets his inside edge onto pad;
26.5;1;Lyon to Latham, 1 run works a tossed up ball on off stump, against the turn, to deep midwicket;
26.4;?;Lyon to Latham, no run good length ball outside off, no shot;
26.3;2;Lyon to Latham, 2 runs goes for the sweep and makes good enough connection for a couple to fine leg;
26.2;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run full and outside off, he smears it to the sweeper.;
26.1;1;Lyon to Latham, 1 run closes the face too early and gets a leading edge through cover point. Gorgeous bowling from Lyon, round the wicket, drifting it into the left-hander and getting it to turn away, sharply;
25.6;1;Starc to Latham, 1 run flicks the full, inswinging delivery at 152 kph to deep square leg;
25.5;?;Starc to Latham, no run 145 kph and it's coming at his throat. Latham tries to lift it over midwicket but he is far far too slow with the shot;
25.4;W;Starc to Williamson, OUT caught behind. One genius gets the other! And it's that dab. It's the go to shot. It's the one that feeds every one of his ODI innings. But not this one. The ball angling across the right hander - a cutter set up for the fourth slip - takes the edge as KW plays the dab and goes through to the keeper. Australia celebrate. Starc celebrates although should he reallly? He keeps taking so many wickets in his first over of a new spell that maybe he should just yawn and wave bye-bye to the other guy;Kane Williamson c ?Carey b Starc 40 (69m 51b 2x4 1x6) SR: 78.43;
25.3;2;Starc to Williamson, 2 runs 151kph, tucks a fullish delivery on leg stump through midwicket and they scurry across for the second as well.;
25.2;2;Starc to Williamson, 2 runs slaps the short and wide delivery at 147 kph right through point, the timing good enough to draw the mistake from the fielder;
25.1;1;Starc to Taylor, 1 run turns the length ball on leg stump through square leg;
24.6;?;Maxwell to Williamson, no run taps it towards point;
24.5;4;Maxwell to Williamson, FOUR runs over mid-off and into the boundary. Sure the ball is turning into him, but he gets a good stride going and there's plenty of width to free the arms;
24.4;?;Maxwell to Williamson, no run defends a tossed up delivery outside off. Maxi's getting lovely drift now.;
24.3;1;Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run;
24.2;1;Maxwell to Williamson, 1 run plenty of flight, luring KW into a hard-hit cover drive that bursts through the hands at short cover to bring up 6000 ODI runs. The third fastest to the mark, three innings behind Kohli;
24.1;1;Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run looms over the tossed up ball outside off and flicks it through midwicket;
23.6;?;Stoinis to Williamson, no run chops the back of a length ball to the right of the keeper;
23.5;2;Stoinis to Williamson, 2 runs bottom edge scurries away past the right of the keeper. Williamson is trying the punch through cover but he's happy for the two nonetheless;
23.4;?;Stoinis to Williamson, no run back of a length and outside off, dabs it behind point;
23.3;6;Stoinis to Williamson, SIX runs lifts it over deep midwicket. A length ball on leg stump and Williamson decides to show off a bit. Sure I could have nudged it along the ground to square leg. Buuuuuut.... I'd rather hit the first six of the day. There! Boom!;
23.2;?;Stoinis to Williamson, no run inside edge onto his boot as he tries to dab the ball to third man;
23.1;?;Stoinis to Williamson, no run stands tall behind a shortish delivery outside off and turns it to mid-on;
22.6;2;Maxwell to Taylor, 2 runs lovely placement. Taylor plants the ball between midwicket and deep square leg with a simple nudge off the pads and his partner is awake to the second run;
22.5;1;Maxwell to Williamson, 1 run spots the length early, goes back and waits for the ball to turn, and only then does he tap it through square leg for a simple single;
22.4;1;Maxwell to Taylor, 1 run nudges a full ball on the pads behind square leg;
22.3;?;Maxwell to Taylor, no run quicker through the air but still very full on off stump. Taylor works it to midwicket. Pressure keeps building;
22.2;?;Maxwell to Taylor, no run gently pats the flighted delivery on off stump into the off side;
22.1;?;Maxwell to Taylor, no run tosses it up on off stump, Taylor pushes it back down the pitch;
21.6;1;Stoinis to Taylor, 1 run gets it to dart away - the legcutter gripping off the pitch - and Taylor follows the ball, steering it to third man with soft hands .Still risky though. A little extra bounce and he could have been caught behind;
21.5;?;Stoinis to Taylor, no run opens the face as he meets a shortish ball outside off, looking for a single to third man, but backward point hasn't been clued in on that plan;
21.4;1;Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run slinks across his stumps to bully a good length ball outside off into the hands of deep square leg;
21.3;?;Stoinis to Williamson, no run blocks a back of a length delivery on off stump;
21.2;2;Stoinis to Williamson, 2 runs misfield at midwicket - Carey, I think - and it allows Williamson to sneak a second after a well played tap, right under his eyes;
21.1;1lb;Stoinis to Taylor, 1 leg bye shapes to pull the back of a length ball on leg stump but it doesn't quite come on and he mistimes it to the left of the keeper;
20.6;1;Finch to Taylor, 1 run full on middle, drives to long-off;
20.5;4;Finch to Taylor, FOUR runs sweeps past short fine leg, the desperate dive doesn't work and New Zealand get a little bit of relief. Poor ball well down leg. Simple putaway, no fuss. And on we go;
20.4;?;Finch to Taylor, no run steps down the pitch to try and whip the ball against the turn through midwicket, but turn is what Finch does, beating the closed face and hitting his pad;
20.3;?;Finch to Taylor, no run defends a flatter delivery on middle stump. Getting just a little grip is the Aussie captain;
20.2;1;Finch to Williamson, 1 run loads up the sweep as the ball slides into leg stump. Plays too early and cue-ends the ball towards midwicket;
20.1;1;Finch to Taylor, 1 run steps down the track to drive a tossed up ball to long-on;
19.6;1;Behrendorff to Taylor, 1 run length, and he cuts it down to third man;

19.4;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run slower ball, traps him on the pads as he shuffles across. Not given leg before, and Australia seem to believe that could have pitched outside leg. Another off-cutter;

19.2;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run length, and straight along the line across from leg to off, and he has to block this;

19.1;1w;Behrendorff to Williamson, 1 wide short, and too short according to the umpires. Also slanted away from him;
18.6;1;Smith to Williamson, 1 run tossed up more, and he drives it well enough to get it past cover;
18.5;1;Smith to Taylor, 1 run another full toss, another shot straight to the sweeper deep on the off side;
18.4;1;Smith to Williamson, 1 run full toss again, and he drives this towards deep point. Great stuff from Starc there;
18.3;?;Smith to Williamson, no run flatter, pitches around leg and strikes him on the pad. Didn't turn back in enough, and probably also pitched outside leg;

18.1;?;Smith to Taylor, no run tossed up, and turns away from him. Beats the outside edge as he tries to drive;

17.4;?;Behrendorff to Taylor, no run slower ball again, angles across Taylor, who reads it and defends this to point;
17.3;1;Behrendorff to Williamson, 1 run DROPPED! Difficult chance through to Carey. This one from Behrendorff was an off-cutter, and moved away from Williamson, who chased it through. Off the toe-end, and dying on Carey, who gets a bit of a finger on it as it runs away from him towards third man;
17.2;?;Behrendorff to Williamson, no run length, jags back into him, and he drops it right by his eyes. Caught by surprise by a bit of extra bounce in that!;
17.1;2;Behrendorff to Williamson, 2 runs length, outside off, and he lashes this through covers. The sweeper will cut it off ahead of the fence, out to his right;

16.5;1;Lyon to Williamson, 1 run looks to sweep from outside off, and paddles it down towards fine leg. Risky, but effective!;

14.6;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run DROPPED? Tossed up outside off, and he saw his chance to drive against the turn. May have taken a bit of the bat, and part of Carey's right pad through to first slip, where the fielder fails to hold on. Steve Smith in position there;
14.5;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run outside off, and he looks to defend this towards point. Very feeble touch, along the ground, fielded by slip;
14.4;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run length, turns into him, and he flicks this towards short midwicket;
14.3;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run fuller, and he pulls out the sweep. A fielder in the deep for that, and he runs to his right and sends in a flat return;
14.2;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run length, turns into him, and comes off his pads and pops up. Lands short of short leg anyway;
14.1;1;Lyon to Williamson, 1 run tossed up, and he taps it to the right of point and picks up a single;

13.1;W;Behrendorff to Guptill, OUT full ball, angles into him, and given out leg before! Guptill chooses to walk. A bit of swing as it comes back into him. He gets his front foot around in front and cannot bring his bat down on time as he overbalances a touch. Behrendorff strikes again by bowling full. This is a vital breakthrough for the Australians;Martin Guptill lbw b Behrendorff 20 (60m 43b 2x4 0x6) SR: 46.51;

10.6;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run length, hits the pitch really hard, and he presses forward to defend this;
10.5;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run short, and angles into him as it goes through to Carey. A half-appeal...may have just brushed his hip;
10.4;1;Cummins to Williamson, 1 run length, outside off, and he is able to run a 144kph ball down towards third man;
10.3;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run jaffa! A good length, just outside off, and moves away a touch off the seam, and goes past his outside edge as he looks to defend;

10.1;1;Cummins to Guptill, 1 run length ball, angles in, and he plays it away towards square leg;

9.5;?;Behrendorff to Williamson, no run good length on off stump, defends;
9.4;2;Behrendorff to Williamson, 2 runs looks for the lbw with a pitched up ball on off stump. Williamson though is so very good at making sure that front leg never goes across. It only ever stays beside the line of the ball so he can bring down a straight bat, which in this case helps an inside edge scurry away through square leg;
9.3;?;Behrendorff to Williamson, no run back of a length and darting away outside off. He lets it go;
9.2;W;Behrendorff to Nicholls, OUT strangled down leg. And he's walking off.

8.2;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run that was there! It was there for the Marty G slap over point. And he does go for it, backing away and giving it his all. But the Cummins bouncer beats him for pace;
8.1;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run solid defensive push from Guptill, into the covers;
7.6;1;Behrendorff to Guptill, 1 run he almost falls over himself because of the late inswing, but because he is switched on, he's able to flick the ball on leg stump away through midwicket. NZ know they're in a fight. They know these first few overs are the biggest threat.;
7.5;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run pitches it up and tests both edges of the bat. Guptill is good enough to plant the middle of it on the ball though;
7.4;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run definite movement at this end for Behrendorff, Another lbw ball, pitching on middle and leg and nipping in at the right-hander. Guptill this time is able to get an inside edge;
7.3;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run good length and outside off, taps it towards point;
7.2;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run fullish and outside off, defends;
7.1;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run huuuge appeal for lbw as Behrendorff gets one to pitch on leg stump and nip in just the slightest bit. Guptill is caught with his front foot in the wrong place. The bat needs to come down around it and it can't make the journey in time. Australia think about the review, but they don;t go for it in the end. Worried about it going down leg, was Behrendorff and so Finch didn't go for it. Replays show it would have been umpire's call on hitting the stumps;
6.6;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run fullish on off stump, defends to cover;
6.5;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run pins him on the pad as Cummins gets his line perfect with the indipper. But it might just have been too high. Certainly was too quick for him as he gets his front leg too far across and gets caught with the bat having to come around it;
6.4;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run bouncer which is allowed to climb over Nicholls' shoulder and go through to the keeper. Good stuff from Nicholls. Looks like he belongs. In a World Cup game. Against Australia.;
6.3;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run good leave. Relies on that a lot in Test cricket. And here too, he covers the stumps to be safe from the ball nipping back in, which in this case is wise because it does just that;
6.2;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run gets just enough movement away from the bat as Nicholls steps forward to defend a fuller delivery on off stump. Bit of an outside edge to point;
6.1;1;Cummins to Guptill, 1 run 144 kph on a good length and outside off. Guptill lets it run off the outside half of the bat to third man;
5.6;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run 147kph, full on off stump, Nicholls brings that bat down well in time;
5.5;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run 154 kph scorcher!. Could be the fastest ball of the Cup. But he picks the line early and lets go a good length ball outside off.;
5.4;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run off the shoulder of the bat to point as Nicholls tries to get on top of a rising delivery on off stump. The only problem is it keeps rising.;
5.4;1w;Starc to Nicholls, 1 wide bouncer on off stump, lets it go, ump says it's too high;
5.3;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run 146 kph - no one bowls a full delivery at the stumps like Starc. That curl away when the ball leaves his hand. The curl in as it travels the pitch. Nicholls is aware of the danger and is playing with as straight a bat as possible;
5.2;4;Starc to Nicholls, FOUR runs that's his shot. The flick off the hips. He plays it with his eyes closed and with one hand making the Spock sign. Too straight. Touch too short. Simply put away;
5.1;4;Starc to Nicholls, FOUR runs beautiful straight drive. Made all the more better by the fact the speedgun says this is 153 kph. Nicholls gets in line and presents the full face so that a ball looking to take over his stumps instead crashes into the boundary boards;
4.6;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run touch too straight and the batsman is able to work it to square leg;
4.5;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run strong push into the covers, but that infield is definitely packed;
4.4;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run un-play-ABLE! Guptill recoils from a ball that pitches on off stump, back of a length, one he thinks he has covered with a back foot block but one that nips away off the pitch like it's nobody's business;
4.3;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run 137kph, punches the short if a length delivery outside off to point;
4.2;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run goes back in his crease to block the 134 kph short ball on middle;
4.1;4;Cummins to Guptill, FOUR runs strays on the pads and Guptill does the most decent thing that ball deserved. An all-expenses paid trip to the fine leg boundary;
3.6;1lb;Starc to Guptill, 1 leg bye half an appeal from Starc as he gets a length ball to curl back into Guptill at pace. The right-hander is trapped. His front foot is too far across and he doesn't have the time to adjust. Only height saves him. These are nervy times.;
3.5;?;Starc to Guptill, no run keeps out a good length ball at 147 kph looking for middle and leg stump. Who wants to be an opening batsman, eh?;
3.4;?;Starc to Guptill, no run back of a length and outside off, no need to bother with those. Just wave to the 152 kph white thing flying by;
3.4;1w;Starc to Guptill, 1 wide goes searching for that inswinging delivery to take out Guptill's stumps. But the 145 kph veers off target;
3.3;?;Starc to Guptill, no run dangles it outside off. Guptill won't bite;
3.2;?;Starc to Guptill, no run gets it to hold its line at 151kph and Guptill does well, watching the ball all the way, getting squared up a touch so he can defend a ball pitching leg and moving away;
3.1;?;Starc to Guptill, no run onto him too quickly as he tries to flick the back of a length ball on middle behind square leg. Beaten for (142kph) pace;
2.6;3;Behrendorff to Guptill, 3 runs hints of movement into the right-hander but Guptill is able to nudge it between midwicket and mid-on. Good connection because he wasn't trying to hit it too hard;
2.6;1w;Behrendorff to Guptill, 1 wide bowler overcompensates for the mistake and goes down the leg side;
2.5;4;Behrendorff to Guptill, FOUR runs screams away through the covers. Guptill gets the room to free his arms and he's calm enough to slap it through the gap;
2.4;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run very tight lines from Behrendorff. Guptill gets forward and defends a ball heading on to off stump;
2.3;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run pitches it right up there, almost on yorker length, Guptill drives to cover;
2.2;?;Behrendorff to Guptill, no run good length on off stump, Guptill keeps it out. Hmm. Might be jumping the gun but Behrendorff isn't getting much movement. And he's known for that;
2.1;2;Behrendorff to Guptill, 2 runs crunches the back of a length delivery outside off behind point.;
1.6;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run dangerous ball! It's the one that he slings out towards the off side but in mid-air it curls back into the left-hander. Essentially the same one Stokes got. Except it isn't a yorker and perhaps that's why Nicholls is able to block it from crashing into his sticks;
1.5;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run slants into the pads at 152 kph and Nicholls, shuffling across his stumps, is hit on his pads. Would have gone down though;
1.4;1;Starc to Guptill, 1 run good stuff, Guppy! Waits for the short ball outside off, taps it gently on top of the bounce and says, Henry, you deal with Starc;
1.3;?;Starc to Guptill, no run should I leave, should I play? Should I even try? This is testing bowling from Australia's strike weapon. He gets his radar perfect. On and around off stump and that last ball jagging back so far is still playing on Guptill's head as he steps forward to play something in between a leave and a block;
1.2;?;Starc to Guptill, no run cuts back in! Like a left-arm legbreak! Hits on and around off stump and then veers into Guptill, who is thinking he has an easy leave and in the end is struck on the thigh;
1.1;?;Starc to Guptill, no run starts with a short ball across the right-hander at 143 kph. Keeps the slips interested. Not the batsman though;
0.6;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run covers the line well and, it seems, he's started to move his feet as well. Gets across to off stump to get behind the short ball;
0.5;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run stands up nice and tall behind the shortish delivery on off stump and blunts it;
0.4;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run half a shout for lbw as Nicholls is stuck in his crease against one that nips back into him off a length. Miiiiiight just be too high;
0.3;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run looks for the flick through square leg but ends up with a welt on his thigh (probably);
0.2;?;Behrendorff to Nicholls, no run nicely behind the 132 kph delivery looking for the top of off stump;
0.1;1;Behrendorff to Guptill, 1 run sweetly timed to the left of mid-off. Good signs for Guptill, who sometimes seems suspect against left-arm quicks because of the ball coming back in. This one though just pitches on a length and carries on with the angle, allowing him to play that favourite on the up drive;

Martin Guptill, who pull off possibly the catch of the tournament, is walking through the Long Room with Henry Nicholls, who is on World Cup debut and playing out of position. New Zealand would back themselves to chase this and get into the semis. But it won't be easy and that's not just because of Australia's bowling attack either. Lord's has rolled out a very sporting surface. Right, here's Jason Behrendorff with two slips in
