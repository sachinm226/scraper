Data
Well, well, Australia have reached an imposing total after being sent in. It could have been even more had West Indies not dragged things back in the middle of the innings before Hussey and Haddin came together. Marsh and Watson had earlier set Australia on their way well before the mini-slump, Marsh reaching fifty on his one-day debut. Now Australia have a daunting 274 under their belts which will be extremely challenging in the conditions.

49.5;3;Bravo to Johnson, 3 runs slower ball, just planted up there on the legs, but it's flicked off to the legs and they run through very well indeed, Gayle a touch ginger in the outfield allowing them the third;
49.4;W;Bravo to Hopes, OUT outside off and this time he drags on a full one back into the sticks, he hears the clicks and has to walk on his way;James Hopes b Bravo 9 (11m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100;

48.4;1;Sarwan to Hopes, 1 run swings a lazy mow over to deep midwicket on the front knee;

5.6;?;Edwards to Watson, no run on the front foot, pushed down to gully;
5.5;4;Edwards to Watson, FOUR runs width outside off, some swing away and Watson is tempted into having a slay away from his body, the ball going from the base of the bat up and over point, squarer than he was aiming for;
5.4;2;Edwards to Watson, 2 runs driven out very straight right through the stumps and it's just to say stopped inside the rope - the ball slowed up a touch by crashing on to the sticks at the non-striker's end;

3.5;1;Edwards to Marsh, 1 run some swing back in, straight, but the batsman manages to press forward, a mere caress;

1.3;?;Gayle to Watson, no run outside off, pushes it past the outside edge, the batsman presses forward on the front foot and it goes on through;
1.2;1;Gayle to Marsh, 1 run pushed off the front foot in line with off and it's wristed into short midwicket;
1.1;?;Gayle to Marsh, no run oh, good start! Some movement away and the batsman shoulders arms;

 Innings Start
So, Australia complete a convincing victory, by 84 runs. Their total always looked daunting in the conditions and indeed West Indies fell away, although they gave their best in patches.
Chris Gayle's being interviewed now and he swears to "bounce back". Here's Ricky Ponting. "Shaun Marsh on his debut game played a beautiful innings. I thought we were a bit sloppy in the field. We expect the younger guys to come in and have some success straight away. It was great to see Shaun out there and looked in good control and he's earned the Man of the Match award today."
Marsh accepts his award. "I probably should have [got the hundred]. It's fantastic to be here. To go well was really good, to get the win was even better. I'm just enjoying every minute of it. To be part of this team is amazing, I'm loving every minute."
Thanks for joining us today and do tune in tomorrow for England's latest ODI with New Zealand and come back later in the week for the next game in this series. Until then, it's goodbye.
