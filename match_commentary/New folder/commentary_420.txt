Not quite the continuation of the day one dominance that Australia fans were expecting. South Africa's main bowlers were a lot better today, with Steyn drying up the runs early on and Morkel bowling an incisive spell. Even before he ended Clarke's innings for 230, he had Clarke nearly caught-out fending at a bouncer. Enough has already been said about teams making 500-plus and still going on to lose at Adelaide, but despite the flat track and the lightning outfield, South Africa's batsmen have a massive task ahead of them. How will Amla and Co respond? Answers soon.
For all those asking about Kallis, here's what the South Africa team manager said yesterday: "He will not be able to bowl in the current Test match but can bat, we can only make a call on his availability for the next Test match closer to the time as it is subject to how he responds to treatment." Of course, given the amount of time Kallis has spent off the field, he won't be able to bat above No. 7.
Balakrishnan Subramaninan: "A more generic metric (instead of counting single and tripe digit scores) would be to measure the mathematical standard deviation of the 11 scores in an innings. I would suspect this innings ranks high up there in terms of innings with the maximum standard deviation across individual scores." Will set the stats team on that.
And here's an Ask Steven column which answers the questions over the highest score made by a team with no one making double-digits. It's not NZ at Perth. Thanks to Mike for sending in the link.
107.2;W;Steyn to Pattinson, OUT the innings is over, Smith takes his fourth catch of the innings, takes it on the second chance after missing it on the first, Pattinson gets a thick edge as he looks to thump a fuller one from Steyn, so Australia all out for 550;James Pattinson c Smith b Steyn 42 (53m 35b 4x4 2x6) SR: 120;
107.1;2;Steyn to Pattinson, 2 runs length ball around off stump, Pattinson again gets the ball away towards point, another misfield, South Africa sloppy here;
106.6;1;Tahir to Pattinson, 1 run connects well with that one, on the bounce to long-on, a slight misfield there;
106.5;?;Tahir to Pattinson, no run outside off, spinning away, Pattinson misses out on that one;
106.4;6;Tahir to Pattinson, SIX runs Pattinson launches that over long-on for six, he has raced along to 39 now, in the slot from Tahir and that is bludgeoned beyond the boundary;

106.1;?;Tahir to Pattinson, no run tossed up and that is defended;
105.6;?;Steyn to Lyon, no run;
105.5;1;Steyn to Pattinson, 1 run Faf du Plessis has made a mess of a simple chance, Pattinson looks to whip that one, the ball loops up towards backward point, Faf didn't have to move much to get under it, he immediately had his right hand up to block out the sun as he tried to pick out the ball, it seemed a sitter, but he has flubbed it, don't think he ever sighted it properly, has a sheepish grin on missing that;
105.4;?;Steyn to Pattinson, no run short of length ball angling in, defended to the left of the non-striker;
105.3;4;Steyn to Pattinson, FOUR runs he does like that point area, another boundary for him as he slices it behind point for four, once more no effort to power the ball, more about placement;
105.2;?;Steyn to Pattinson, no run fast bowlers, what can you say, the typical response from steyn, who bangs it in and targets Pattinson's head, Pattinson ducks early;
105.1;4;Steyn to Pattinson, FOUR runs Pattinson looking better than a No. 9 here, shortish from Steyn, Pattinson gets back in the crease and pushes it through extra cover for four, didn't look to thrash that;
104.6;1;Tahir to Pattinson, 1 run keeps strike by tucking the ball towards midwicket for a single;
104.5;6;Tahir to Pattinson, SIX runs a six this time, Tahir's Test not getting better here, tossed up and Pattinson power-sweeps that to the midwicket boundary;
104.4;4;Tahir to Pattinson, FOUR runs crashed off the back foot this time, slashes it through point for four, Tahir as he do ever so often drops his googly too short;
104.3;?;Tahir to Pattinson, no run big stride in as he blocks out Tahir;
104.2;?;Tahir to Pattinson, no run gets forward and defends;

102.2;?;Kleinveldt to Pattinson, no run defended to the leg side this time;

101.6;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run outside off, short of length ball, Lyon does well to keep his bat away from that, survives the over;
101.5;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run bouncer from Morkel, Lyon ducks under;
101.4;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run gets this one to snake back in, that is too good for Lyon, Lyon looks to go forward to that back of length ball, then gets stuck on the crease, drops his hands and the ball whacks him on the ribs, hope he has a chest guard on;
101.3;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run thick outside edge this time, somehow instead of arcing through to slips, it bounces fairly quickly after hitting the bat and rolls through to the slip fielder;

99.6;W;Morkel to Hilfenhaus, OUT and Morkel completes his five-for, the short ball does the job, this was headed for the helmet, Hilfenhaus goes for the hook, top-edges it towards deep backward square leg, a duck for the Hilf, Australia 504 for 9, not quite going to plan for them today;Ben Hilfenhaus c Kleinveldt b Morkel 0 (7m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
99.5;?;Morkel to Hilfenhaus, no run terrific line there from Morkel, not too short, gets plenty of bounce and that is just outside off, Hilfenhaus has a lame prod at it and is beaten;

98.3;?;Kleinveldt to Hilfenhaus, no run outside off and that is left alone;
98.2;W;Kleinveldt to Siddle, OUT Kleindveldt gets his first Test wicket, or does he? the no-ball check, that is tight, many replays needed to check whether it is behind the line, looks to be safe by mere millimetres, he is, Kleinveldt can finally savour a Test wicket, Siddle gets a healthy nick through to slip, that was a back of a length ball, Siddle might have been better off playing off the front foot, he hangs back in the crease, so Australia 21/3 on the day;Peter Siddle c Smith b Kleinveldt 6 (30m 21b 1x4 0x6) SR: 28.57;
98.1;?;Kleinveldt to Siddle, no run short of length ball angling in towards middle, solidly defended by Siddle;
97.6;?;Morkel to Pattinson, no run shorter and wider, that doesn't bother the batsman at all;
97.5;?;Morkel to Pattinson, no run Pattinson doesn't have to play at that, it is too far outside off;
97.4;?;Morkel to Pattinson, no run outside off, and that is an easy leave;

97.2;2;Morkel to Pattinson, 2 runs Pattinson ducks seeing the short ball but he left the bat hanging in the air, he unintentionally gets off the mark as the ball hits low (high) on the bat, and luckily for Pattinson, lobs to safety, towards short fine leg;

96.6;?;Kleinveldt to Siddle, no run full ball is blocked back down the pitch;
96.5;?;Kleinveldt to Siddle, no run Kelinveldt also gets in the bouncer act, Siddle spots it early and wants to hook that one, but can't connect, there was a sound as that passed the batsman on it's way to the keeper, not sure whether there was any glove involved, no appeal from South Africa for a caught-behind;

96.1;?;Kleinveldt to Siddle, no run his first ball is on a length around middle stump, turned to the leg side;
95.6;W;Morkel to Wade, OUT Morkel strikes again, Wade hadn't scored in a while, he thought he could crash a length ball outside off through the cover, only gets a thin edge through to the keeper, Wade is distraught as he trudges off, knowing that there were some runs to be had on what remains a lovely batting track;Matthew Wade c ?de Villiers b Morkel 6 (41m 28b 1x4 0x6) SR: 21.42;
95.5;1;Morkel to Siddle, 1 run pitched up, Siddle looks to power this past extra cover, it was in the air but lands short of Tahir, who gets his body behind it;
95.4;4;Morkel to Siddle, FOUR runs this one is full and it is beautifully whipped to the square-leg boundary to bring up Australia's 500;
95.3;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run Siddle getting treated to a series of bouncers here, this one was just outside off, Siddle ducks under, he's still not been too tested by the short ones;
95.2;1;Morkel to Wade, 1 run length ball on the pads, clipped towards fine leg for a single;
95.1;?;Morkel to Wade, no run another short ball, just outside off, Wade sways away from the line of that one;
94.6;?;Steyn to Siddle, no run gets the outside edge, bounces through towards gully where Jacques Rudolph makes a diving stop, the runs have dried up for Australia, that's another maiden for Steyn, his third in a row;
94.5;?;Steyn to Siddle, no run another bouncer from Steyn, 138.7kph, Siddle ducks under that one comfortably, not too fussed by that short ball;
94.4;?;Steyn to Siddle, no run drops it shorter this time, on leg stump as well, Siddle looks to pull that away but is quite late on the stroke;

91.6;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run and the final ball of a cracking over is left alone;
91.5;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run a massive lbw appeal there, short of length ball angling in, Siddle isn't too keen to get forward, he's struck just over the knee roll in front of the stumps, that looked to be going over, South Africa of course have no more reviews so they can't do much after the umpire shakes his head at their appeal;
91.4;W;Morkel to Clarke, OUT it's over! stop the press, Michael Clarke has been dismissed, yes he has, that was pitched up by Morkel, Clarke stays in the crease as he looks to play that one, he misses and the ball cannons into middle stump, that ball angled in, more than Clarke expected, between bat and pad, end of a classic from Clarke, end of a nightmare for South Africa;Michael Clarke b Morkel 230 (345m 257b 40x4 1x6) SR: 89.49;
91.3;1;Morkel to Wade, 1 run on the leg stump line, squeezed out behind square leg;

89.5;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run forward defence to the off side;
89.4;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run ooh, Clarke survives, another bouncer from Morkel, gets big on him, hits high on the bat, on the shoulder of the bat actually, the loops up, both the keeper and slip race forward towards the stumps to try take that but there was no way they could have got to it, Morkel grimaces, not much going South Africa's way;
89.3;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run gets on the back foot and opens the face of the bat as he pushes the ball towards cover, a loud 'No,' to let Wade know there's no single there;
89.2;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run short of length ball just outside off, Clarke (as the cliche goes) knows where his offstump is and is confident enough to leave that though it snaked in a touch;

88.6;?;Steyn to Wade, no run not much bounce there for Steyn, outside off and Wade shoulders arms;

88.4;?;Steyn to Wade, no run wide outside off, and that is another leave;
88.3;?;Steyn to Wade, no run another leave, closer to off this time, not too much movement yet for Steyn, who is yet to reach top pace, only 129kph this one;
88.2;?;Steyn to Wade, no run good length and outside off, Wade watches it closely and allows it through to the keeper;

86.6;?;Steyn to Wade, no run Steyn begins the day with a gentle delivery outside off that wade is happy to leave to the keeper, the end of the over;
86.5;W;Steyn to Hussey, OUT and against all odds, Steyn has bowled Hussey and that will be stumps on the first day. Steyn pitched on a good length around off and the ball came back into the left-hander. Hussey was late in bringing his bat down and the ball hit the top of off stump. That will be small consolation for South Africa, they have received a severe hiding;Michael Hussey b Steyn 103 (209m 137b 9x4 4x6) SR: 75.18;

Hussey pushed forward as a good length ball pitched in line and seamed across the left-hander. The ball went past the outside edge and hot-spot shows no sign of an edge. Was there a bit of a deflection? I can't be sure. Is there enough evidence to overturn the decision? I'm not sure. Faint edges don't always show up on hot spot. There seems to be a small noise, very small. This is taking ages. And the final decision is that Hussey will bat on.;

 Innings Start
Excellent hand by Du Plessis on debut, but Australia are in a strong position here, having gained a lead of 162. They have around 30-odd overs today and a good part of tomorrow to stretch that and put South Africa under pressure in the fourth innings. They were in a position to close out this innings for much lesser than 388, but that stand between Du Plessis and the injured Kallis was critical. Time for tea, and we'll be back with the Australian second innings. Join us at 3.30pm Adelaide time.

Bowden's given him out caught-behind. Did it move away just as the bat came down? Hot Spot shows a tiny heat signature on the outside edge, a very tiny one but it's there nevertheless. Bowden's waiting for the final call, and raises his finger. Smith isn't happy, he called for a review immediately after Bowden first gave him out;Graeme Smith c ?Wade b Siddle 122 (295m 244b 14x4 0x6) SR: 50;

Been quite a fightback from South Africa, but Australia are still the team in the stronger position. It started in the morning where Morne Morkel and Co took out the six remaining Australian wickets early on to keep the home side to550, when 650 was on the cards. Then their captain, Graeme Smith, led the way with a century on a track which still has almost nothing in it for the quicks. Clearly, South Africa's day but it would have been an even better one if Alviro Petersen hadn't been strangely lax in getting to the non-striker's end, and Amla gifted his wicket to the part-time leg spin of David Warner.
For a better wrap of the day's proceedings check out Brydon Coverdale's report.
Stories from the prolific pair of Dan Brettig and Firdose Moonda expected from Adelaide shortly. you could occupy yourself before those arrive by checking out the Mumbai Test or the Khulna Test.
Thanks for all the mails today, see you all tomorrow. Cheers!
 Innings Start
Australia have decided to declare, Pattinson and Hilfenhaus got some quick runs after the fall of Matthew Wade, took the lead past 400 and it's a formidable target. Pattinson may not bowl in the fourth innings, though, due to a side strain - he went for a scan and the results are still awaited. But Kallis is injured as well, though he may bat below his regular position at No.4. South Africa have chased down 400 to win a game before in Australia, but these are more difficult circumstances. Join us in a short while for their reply. Tahir, by the way, has gone for the most runs for a bowler without a wicket in a Test.
69.6;?;Tahir to Hilfenhaus, no run quicker and flatter on middle, mistimes a pull to midwicket;

68.3;4;Steyn to Pattinson, FOUR runs Pattinson's whipped that between mid-on and midwicket, slightly short and he picked the length early to rock back and beat that gap, timed that superbly;
68.2;?;Steyn to Pattinson, no run short of a good length, Pattinson punches that towards extra cover;
68.1;?;Steyn to Pattinson, no run good length on middle and off, rocks back and defends it back towards the bowler;
67.6;?;Tahir to Hilfenhaus, no run steps forward and taps it towards point;
67.5;?;Tahir to Hilfenhaus, no run the googly that Hilfy didn't pick, tossed up outside off and it spun back in and Hilfy left it alone, while it was perilously close to the off stump;

67.3;4;Tahir to Pattinson, FOUR runs more runs, flighted outside off and that's been hammered through the covers, lots of width and Australia are now 418 ahead;

66.3;?;Kleinveldt to Hilfenhaus, no run charges out to Kleinveldt as the bowler drags it short, tries to smack him through square leg, can't connect well, however;
66.2;4;Kleinveldt to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs poor ball, short and wide and more easy runs for Hilfy, almost identical but gets more elevation this time to find the third-man boundary yet again;
66.1;4;Kleinveldt to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs drops that one short outside off and Hilfy cuts that between slip and gully to stretch the lead to 400, moves away and slashes it through that gap;

63.2;W;Morkel to Wade, OUT Wade goes! Full outside off and Wade is sucked into the drive, tries to hit it through extra cover, gets a feather as it moves away a bit and AB takes a dolly;Matthew Wade c ?de Villiers b Morkel 18 (73m 50b 1x4 0x6) SR: 36;
63.1;?;Morkel to Wade, no run fullish outside off and that's been left alone to the keeper;
62.6;?;Kleinveldt to Pattinson, no run Given out lbw, and Pattinson has called for a review, Kleinveldt got it to nip back in, just a tiny part of his foot appears to be behind the line, just a fraction and that may be enough to save him. Too difficult to say, lands on the off and moves back in to strike him on the back pad. Oh, Eagle Eye says it would have gone over the stumps, so the decision will have to be overturned. Not a no-ball, but the ball would have gone over, according to Eagle Eye and Smith smiles in disbelief.;

 Innings Start
An epic Test, this, kept us on our seats till the last ball was bowled. Despite losing Pattinson, Australia will think they should have won this Test after having South Africa four down at stumps on the fourth day. Both teams gave it their all on the final day - Australia threw everything they had at South Africa, and South Africa were determined to save the game. Du Plessis is the hero, the and clearly the Man of the Match for his performance in both innings. What a sparkling debut. Spare a thought for Siddle, he somehow conjured up the energy for a final burst and removed Kleinvedlt with a beauty but Morne Morkel held his ground. Du Plessis had good support throughout his battle today - there was AB, of course, followed by a 99-run stand with Kallis who fought through injury, and Steyn and Kleinveldt hung around for long enough before Morkel saw him through to stumps.
Thanks for tuning in and sending us your feedback. The Perth Test gets underway on the 30th and the series is still open. Do join us then. Brydon Coverdale's final report is getting updated. Watch out for some stats highlights from the game as well - plenty in there, given how long South Africa batted. Thanks again.
