 Innings Start
Peter Siddle leads Australia off the field. They won't enforce the follow-on it seems, with Clarke having asked for the heavy roller. Another top effort from this well-oiled attack, getting India for less than half of what their batsmen made on an excellent batting wicket.
VVS Laxman got his 167 in the third Test of that 1999-2000 tour of Australia, Rahul Dravid his 148 in the third Test of the 1996-97 tour of South Africa. After being denied in Perth, Virat finally gets his maiden hundred in the fourth Test of the 2011-12 tour. If you give youth a rope on a tour, give them a long one.

Australia will bat, they would want their bowlers fresh for the second innings
 Innings Start
A proud Australia pose with the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, and that brings us to the end of one of the most one-sided Test series ever. There will be lots of analysis from our team in Australia. For the moment, this is Abhishek Purohit signing off. Congratulations to Australia, they have shown how to rebuild a declining side. For India fans, hold on to that nostalgia. That is all there will be, for a while.
Michael Clarke is Man of the Series. Clarke: "It's a pretty good start. Lot of credit to the players and support staff. It has not been easy, it may look like that on the scoreboard with 4-0. The disappointment of last summer, we resolved to make sure it does not recur this summer. We have tried to improve every day we have gone into training. I have been happy the whole summer, I have had a lot of support and needed it. India have a lot of great players, they have copped a bit of slack over the last month. It's an honour to play against them. I have never made so many runs in a series in my career. To score runs against such a good bowling line-up has been good."
MS Dhoni is welcomed with a warm round of applause. Dhoni: "They have played consistent cricket. whenever a partnership was needed, their batsmen stepped up and put par-plus runs on the board. Their bowlers did consistently. they always stepped up. there comes a phase in Australia once you are set it is difficult for bowlers, that is when you have to be consistent with line and length, we were never given boundaries. We will have to wait and watch [if there are changes], our next Test series is only in September, there is plenty of time, we don't want to take decisions quickly, we have the ODI series coming up. It is a completely different side. It is alearning experience for the youngsters. Once you play 100-odd ODIs, it is always good to have that experience when you make your Test debut."
Man of the Match is a grinning Peter Siddle. Siddle: "I was probably unlucky earlier. the bowling unit has done superbly together, I was lucky to get rewards here. The batting has been lovely. We have stuck to having bowling partnerships every Test. My bowling length has improved, there is consistency."
Presentation starts. Mark Taylor introduces Ravi Shastri as great Indian batsman and left-arm spinner.
Australia in a huddle, now they acknowledge the applause from the crowd, Michael Clarke wears an emphatic in-charge look on his face, there have been wobbles, against South Africa and New Zealand, but he is now in complete control of a solid side
Phil: "The aussies have just shown how to re-build! Who would have thought that this was what the Aussies were going to do, given the results against SA and NZ. Hats off to clarke! and I'm afraid if the Indians do not take some very DRASTIC steps, they will be in eternal decline!"
utkarsh: "Its proof again, if Dravid fails in foreign soil India fare badly. If he faces 300 balls, Indian batting finds its joyful electric feet against a jaded attack and old ball, if he faces 175 balls, they manage about 300 and if he goes less than 30 balls, they simply collapse against the shiny cherry and pacers wid tails up. We might know his worth in years to come. Better still, I hope Pujara rises to the challenge."
Dheeraj: "Good things often come to an end. It is particularly sad when it comes in such a devastating way. The depressing part is not the present or the near past, but the future. I have absolutely no hope from the cricket administration in India for creating a stronger first class structure. India had done well, in spite, of this admin. So long and thanks for all the fish."
Mehtab: "Dont understand why Australia is unwilling to host Bangladesh. Bangladesh could have done a lot better in the four tests than India, You cannot do any worse than this."
Jatinder: "Disappointment, anger, hate, frustration, sarcasm, embarrassment, . I wonder what kind of human emotions are remaining.."

10.28 am Right, how soon will this end? Ravi Shastri gives India 45 minutes, maximum
Gareth: "There's a lot of doom an gloom coming from Indian supporters. Considering the likes of Rahane, Pujara, R Shama and Mukund are just waiting in the wings, I wouldn't be too depressed. It's sad to see these greats begin to filter out, but there's a lot to look forward to!"
Mark Kidger: "Virender Sehwag averages 43.9 in 20 Tests v Australia; 44.4 in 10 Tests v New Zealand and a lowly 27.0 in 13 Tests v England. Overall, in 33 Tests in England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand he averages only 35.2, which suggests that he has tended to pad his average with big runs in familiar conditions. Maybe not in the class of the other three, who are all genuine greats?"
Pete: "Australia has the Ashes to build retirement plans around - this senior player is holding out for the next Ashes; should he retire to let some new blood in before the next Ashes? I wish Pakistan were still playing at home so India could have the same sort of structuring to their retirement horizons."
Prasanna: "@Venkat - a 4-0 loss hurts even more, we should also think about the collective retirements of Mcgrath, Justin Langer and Shane Warne when they had 1-2 years left in them."
Mikey: "Would be fitting if Dravid and Laxman announced their retirements in the same press conference, rekindling their famous partnerships of the last decade or so. Would have loved to see them bow out in Bangalore and Hyderabad, but that seems too far away. Best of luck legends!"
Vikram: "@Venkat: I don't think it is a case of Dravid being made a scapegoat, but rather yet another instance of him accepting responsibility and being a team-man. Compare this to the two other elephants in the room." Hold on for a while till after the game, nothing official has come through yet
10.15 am Hot day, good batting pitch, says Ian Chappell on air. Not that it matters with only four wickets left
Venkat: "It's very sad to read reports of Dravid saying goodbye...the man who stood tall among the ruins of batting failure in England not too long ago is being made a scapegoat for the collective team failure." As I said yesterday, only the memories are left of what was a golden era in Indian batting. But it's time now, really, with India's next Test assignment some months away
9.50 am So will a glorious and long Test career or two be ended today with a formal announcement? It might, it might not. Australia have four wickets to take before that, and inflict another 4-0 rout on India, months after they were hammered by the same scoreline in England. Final day of India's Test tour of Australia today. On their previous two tours, they had gone into the final day having earned respect for their displays. This time, apart from standing ovations for Sachin Tendulkar - which have also taken on a rather ornamental note in the absence of runs - there has been little else. Just have a look at the series returns - Tendulkar 35.87, Sehwag 24.75, Dravid 24.25, Laxman 19.37. Utterly disappointing and ultimately, damning
