Gnasher will be back for the start of the run chase.
8.40pm Innings break Brilliant fightback by the Black Caps. They were 3 for 19 before Conway and Phillips combined in an excellent 74-run stand. Conway makes a T20I career-best 99 not out. He was superb in finding the gaps. He struck the ball with power but also ran superbly between the wickets.
Conway: "It was a little difficult early. The wicket was a bit sticky and it got better and better."
Caleb: "That is one of the great T20I innings of all time, given NZ start. Remember, NZ didn't get the RPO above 6 until the 9th over, so for Conway to lead them to 184 is outstanding. Last 11 overs were 129/2... simple outstanding from Conway!"
Richard: "Devon Conway now averages 91 in T20Is."

Presentation
Devon Conway is the Player of the Match for his 99 not out: "I think I just got myself in and ran hard between wickets. I was pretty happy with how it went tonight. You've just got to ride that form wave as long as you can. It's about momentum and keeping that momentum."
Kane Williamson: "An incredible knock from Devon. It was obviously a tough start with the bat and Devon led us back on a surface that wasn't all that easy to start on. It was just perhaps holding a little bit. An incredible knock. There's still a number of things we would like to do a little bit better. The bowlers were outstanding. It swung a little bit and Tim and Trent were at their best."
Aaron Finch: "We didn't play our best tonight. New Zealand played well. Devon Conway well and truly deserved a hundred. They're tough to come by in T20s and he played an absolutely great knock. I thought they built a great partnership and their foundation was through their running between wickets. We didn't get it right. It nipped and swung a bit under lights."
10.20pm Easy win for New Zealand. They were far too good in all departments for Australia. Their new ball bowling did the damage upfront and then Ish Sodhi cleaned up the middle order with his best T20I figures. Mitch Marsh played well for his 45 but Australia were humbled.
Dante: "So NZ spinners have tonight destroyed Australia - on our most seamer friendly wicket - with more than competent assistance from our seamers. Feel free to keep sending your second string Australia, great confidence boost and a headache for our selectors. Aussie who?"
