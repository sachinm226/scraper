Data
An admirable batting display by Australia here, as the middle order succeeded in building on a good opening partnership. Haddin was the star for the hosts, reaching his maiden ODI century, and was well supported by Clarke who reached his second consecutive half-century. Hussey and Ferguson scored some quick runs in the batting powerplay to set New Zealand a daunting target, despite losing some wickets towards the end. Join us in about half-an-hour for the run-chase

 Innings Start
New Zealand batted well to reach where they did, and when Elliott and McCullum were going strong, a win could not have been ruled out. Partnerships were the key for New Zealand as their middle order put together productive stands at a fairly good rate, despite a poor start. Brad Haddin has been adjudicated as the Man of the Match, and Australia have averted a sixth consecutive defeat to keep the series alive.Do tune in for the next ODI in Adelaide on February 10, which promises to be another cracker. Until then, it's goodbye from all of us at Cricinfo. Adios!
