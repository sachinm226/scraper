Data
Bond led New Zealand's outstanding effort in the field. He now has 33 wickets in 10 ODIs at a staggering 13.12 apiece against them. Australia never lost a clutch of wickets together but they were just unable to score. The target of 149 may seem small on paper but conditions are not easy for batting and Australia will fight tooth and nail. Join me in about 35 minutes (18.15 local time) for the second innings.

 Innings Start
It's been 22 years since New Zealand last had an opening-stand of over hundred against Australia. Australia have been defeated by ten wickets for the first time in ODI history today. They were missing five key players - Ponting, Gilchrist, Clarke, Lee and Symonds - but they have been humiliated.
The New Zealand bowlers - Shane Bond in particular - made a difficult pitch look unplayable. The Australian batsmen were very subdued and didn't build any momentum. Lou Vincent and Stephen Fleming batted aggressively from the start of the chase and that made a lot of difference.
Here's another interesting fact, if Australia go on to lose the Chappell-Hadlee series, South Africa will move ahead of them as the No 1 ranked team on ODIs. It will be the first time Australia have been dethroned since the ratings were introduced by the ICC in 2002.
Shane Bond is the obvious choice for the Man of the Match. He bowled superbly right through and returned figures of 5 for 23. I've enjoyed bringing today's game to you. Keep a watch on Cricinfo for updates on Oram's finger. Thank you for all your emails and do join us on Sunday for the second ODI at Auckland. This is George Binoy signing off. Cheers!
