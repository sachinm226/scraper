"Maybe it's because I'm used to Australia's poor showing in T20, or perhaps it's the fear of chasing against any side with Steyn in the attack, but this game is far from over!" Gareth is spot on this is game on now with those last two overs going for 28 and South Africa scrapping their way up to a competitive total, which with their bowling line up is more than defendable, they should have defended a lower total against Pakistan so will be full of confidence. A little gem of an innings from Robin Peterson, pulled off some extraordinary stokes and, with Behardien, produced an essential partnership towards the end of the innings. Sid will guide you through the chase in 10 minutes...

10.2;1;Doherty to Behardien, 1 run floated up nicely again, middle stump, pushed past the bowler down to long off;
10.1;W;Doherty to Duminy, OUT and gets another one straight away! Duminy down the track gets beaten and is stumped by a country mile. More lovely flight by Doherty, drew Duminy down the pitch and he was no where near it, tried to adjust, I think the ball ended up going between his legs and my grandfather could have made that stumping with a cup of tea in one hand and a scone in the other;Jean-Paul Duminy st ?Wade b Doherty 30 (36m 25b 4x4 0x6) SR: 120;
15.6;4;Hogg to Peterson, FOUR runs goes for another switch hit and another good connection, picks the gap too between point and short third man;

14.2;1;Watson to Peterson, 1 run full, outside off, driven past point to the sweeper;
14.1;W;Watson to de Villiers, OUT or not as the case may be! De Villiers slaps this straight to extra cover and is caught easily! It was a slower ball on middle stump, de Villiers backed away to try and go over the off side but misread the pace of the ball and could only chip it straight to the fielder who claimed a simple chance at chest height;AB de Villiers c Bailey b Watson 21 (36m 24b 0x4 0x6) SR: 87.5;

8.6;1;Watson to Duminy, 1 run well bowled, a little shape in to the off stump, dabbed down towards point and they take a single;
8.5;1;Watson to de Villiers, 1 run the very annoying de Villiers wait-wait-wait-dab to third man, I say annoying because I feel he often misses out on hittable balls doing that;
8.4;1;Watson to Duminy, 1 run full length just outside off, carved down to third man;
8.3;4;Watson to Duminy, FOUR runs short and pulled wide of long leg, the slower nature of the pitch should make those short balls easier to put away today, got on top of it nicely and helped it behind square;
8.2;?;Watson to Duminy, no run full ball just outside off, driven to mid off;
8.1;1;Watson to de Villiers, 1 run full ball, tapped to midwicket, Duminy is sent back, a direct hit but Duminy was back, the ball ricochets away for a single after all;
7.6;?;Hogg to Duminy, no run tossed up turns a bit, kept out back to the bowler;
7.5;?;Hogg to Duminy, no run length ball just outside off, goes down for the reverse sweep and misses, half a cry for a catch behind of the glove, didn't need to go down to reverse that;

7.3;1;Hogg to Duminy, 1 run touch fuller, clipped into the vacant midwicket area again, Hogg chases and fields himself;

6.5;1;Cummins to Duminy, 1 run similar length, tighter line to off stump, Duminy opens the face and gets it to third man;
6.4;4;Cummins to Duminy, FOUR runs forward and a fine drive past extra cover, this is well timed, played really well that;
6.3;1;Cummins to de Villiers, 1 run much fuller, forward and driven out to the cover sweeper;
6.3;1w;Cummins to de Villiers, 1 wide big bumper, ignored, that had good carry though, went through nicely;
6.2;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run again going back and trying to drive off the back foot but mistimes it to mid on;
6.1;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run back of a length around off stump, blocked back to the bowler;
5.6;1;Watson to de Villiers, 1 run back of a length outside off, dabbed down to third man;
5.5;W;Watson to Amla, OUT step across the stumps, goes to pull and gloved behind! Amla falls and Watson does the job again. A shorter ball, again not coming on as the batsman might expect, Amla went across his stumps to pull into the leg side, but was through with the stroke too soon and gloved a ball to Wade and walked straight off, what a blow for Australia;Hashim Amla c ?Wade b Watson 17 (26m 15b 1x4 1x6) SR: 113.33;
5.4;?;Watson to Amla, no run back of a length again, punched to cover;

4.5;1;Cummins to Amla, 1 run step across the stumps, flicks a full ball off middle to the deep square leg;
4.4;4;Cummins to Amla, FOUR runs gives himself room and edges a length delivery past short long leg for four. Lucky that, tried to go through the off side but got a big edge;
4.3;1;Cummins to Duminy, 1 run back of a length, a little straight, dangerous with long leg up, tried to help it around the corner, got it off the glove to the fielder;
4.2;?;Cummins to Duminy, no run nicely bowled, yorker length just outside off, dug out and they refuse the wicket single, perhaps with remembering the run out of Gambhir the other night;
4.1;1;Cummins to Amla, 1 run back of a length around off stump, blocked into the covers, into the gap for a single;
3.6;4;Starc to Duminy, FOUR runs fuller and this drive finds the gap between point and cover and runs to the rope;

3.4;?;Starc to Duminy, no run good length just outside off, driven on the up to backward point on the front foot;
3.4;1w;Starc to Duminy, 1 wide doesn't adjust to the leftie and send it down leg;
3.3;1;Starc to Amla, 1 run good drive to cover point, oh there's a huge mix up, a direct hit and Duminy is miles out, but the throw is so far wide of the one-stump Hussey had to aim at, lucky that for SA;
3.2;?;Starc to Amla, no run full of a good length, cut and missed at;
3.1;?;Starc to Amla, no run well bowled, little bit of shape in from just outside off, blocked back to the bowler from a length;
2.6;1;Doherty to Amla, 1 run step down the track, fired into the pads, Amla adjusts and digs it out towards long off;
2.5;?;Doherty to Amla, no run dragged down a little short, the cut stroke only finds cover point;
2.4;6;Doherty to Amla, SIX runs floated up again but Amla gives himself a little bit of room and lifts it over extra cover and it flies into the stands, awesome timing, picked up from off stump, heavens is this guy in good touch;
2.3;1;Doherty to Duminy, 1 run back again, this time clipped into midwicket;
2.2;?;Doherty to Duminy, no run back on the off stump blocking;
2.1;W;Doherty to Kallis, OUT oh edged and gone and Doherty gets another. It's a cracking delivery, tossed up on a length just outside off, Kallis pushed at it and got a thin edge to Wade to held the chance very well, it was a decent edge. What a start for Doherty, what a selection. Beautifully bowled, flighted nicely and a little turn this time gets the edge of Kallis;Jacques Kallis c ?Wade b Doherty 6 (7m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 85.71;
1.6;1;Starc to Kallis, 1 run more conventional, coming forward and punching a length ball to mid off, the take a quick single;
1.5;4;Starc to Kallis, FOUR runs full ball just outside off, didn't seem to be perfectly timed, but gets it down the ground for four, had to slightly drag it but effective;
1.4;?;Starc to Kallis, no run this is certainly an indication of the pace of the wicket, this is back of a length, Kallis goes to pull and is there too soon, gets hit on the body;
1.3;?;Starc to Kallis, no run angled across the right-hander, Kallis goes to drive and gets an inside edge towards midwicket, sign of the pace of this wicket;
1.2;1;Starc to Amla, 1 run gets across his stumps and flicks a full ball well timed straight to the deep square fielder;
1.1;?;Starc to Amla, no run length just outside off stump, left alone;
0.6;?;Doherty to Kallis, no run back of a length and punched into the covers;
0.5;1;Doherty to Amla, 1 run leg stump and clipped out to deep square;
0.4;1;Doherty to Kallis, 1 run and drives his first ball from off stump down to long off;
0.3;W;Doherty to Levi, OUT and this goes straight through Levi's attempted drive and flicks out leg stump, what a start for Doherty. He seemed to get outside leg stump, exposing all three, this time trying to drive a good length ball into the covers, but it skidded on past his stroke and cleaned him up, the miserable run continues for Levi;Richard Levi b Doherty 0 (2m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
0.2;?;Doherty to Levi, no run further towards leg stump, goes to flick it away and gets struck on the pad, was going down;
0.1;?;Doherty to Levi, no run full around middle and leg, punched back to the bowler;

Hello everyone, hope you're all well. Welcome along to coverage of Australia v South Africa from Colombo. The Boks were dominant in the rugby yesterday and what price the Proteas following that win with a success in the cricket today? All set for a cracker and the sun is out at the Premadasa.

South Africa are looking to get going after their remarkable defeat to Pakistan in the first game. To do so they're going to have to get past Shane Watson who has been in sparkling form so far in this tournament and the praise has flowed in for the allrounder. Can Steyn, Morkel et al remove him cheaply today? We're yet to see the experienced Australian middle order have too much to do so far and that is what South Africa will be looking to exploit this afternoon.

3pm Time for the toss...heads call AB de Villiers but it lands a tail. Australia have won the toss and have decided to bowl first. Xavier Doherty comes in for Dan Christian to add an extra spin option for them. For South Africa, AB reckons he would have batted first anyway and brings in Wayne Parnell for Albie Morkel.

3.15pm So Australia sticking with the formula that has seen them win all three matches so far in the competition. They're going to be chasing once again but if Watson and Warner don't fire, is that going to heap even more pressure on their lower order? Or...it gives them the perfect platform to prove the Aussies have no worries in their line up.

Adnan's nervous about the South African selection: "Albie Morkel gave more depth to SA batting and I reckon on this pitch a strong batting line up is required. Fingers crossed though." I too, am not sure that Parnell adds too much more in the bowling department than Morkel. In his last T20I, he got smashed to all parts by England. Yet to make an appearance in this tournament either.

3.25pm Ha ha, very good, South Africa fans in the stands with fake bears, a nod to Hashim Amla, their star performer of the last 12 months. Here come the teams for the National Anthems. Couple of manageable numbers coming up so we won't be stood for too long...heard these two yesterday afternoon, deja vu...there were a few more fans in Pretoria mind, the crowd today is rather sparse which is a disaster because this should be a super game. The locals obviously saving their money for that small game coming up later on, can't even remember who's playing...

Here we go then, Amla and Richard Levi out for South Africa and Xavier Doherty the man fresh in the side, is going to open up...

 Innings Start
A comprehensive win for Australia in the end. South Africa reached a score they didn't look good to reach at one point, but despite reaching 146 they weren't able to contain a team in form. Watson, again, led the way and Hussey gave him superb support. Australia are in a great position to qualify for the semis, thanks to another convincing win. South Africa are not out, but much will depend on how the other results in the group go. A marquee clash of sorts this, and one more coming soon, but it turned out to be not quite a closely-fought game. We shall bring you the presentation shortly, but do read Brydon Coverdale's report here.
AB: "Very disappointed. Just frustrating when we don't click. I just can't put my finger on one thing, it went wrong everywhere. They didn't allow us to get off to a flier and we lost quite a few wickets and that didn't give us the momentum. Watson is a class player. It's not all doom and gloom, hopefully we'll win on Tuesday."
Bailey: "A tough call to make for a winning team, but Doherty really helped put South Africa on the back foot. The way Shane, Mike and Warner have been batting, chasing has gone very well for us. 146 was about par. Great start for Doherty, he was brought in to pick some early wickets against batsmen who like the ball to come on a bit more."
Another MOM award for Watson: "Nice to be able to continue to play well. I know how important my role is. It's still a hell of a long way to go. Facing Steyn and Morkel was going to be a very big challenge. I knew if we got through the first four overs, we had to take on a few other bowlers but it was going to hold momentum for the innings. Hussey stabilised the innings. The top four batsmen are the ones who win you games consistently. Hussey took the pressure off me to score."
Well, that's basically it from here. Time for another big one, India v Pakistan, shortly, at the same venue. So stay tuned in for that. Take care, be well. Cheers.

10.2;1;Peterson to Watson, 1 run knocks it away for a single;
10.1;2;Peterson to Watson, 2 runs dropped, how costly will that prove? Watson reached forward to that flighted ball from Peterson, Parnell's running in from long-off, slides and it's dying on him, just manages to get his hands underneath it but can't hold on, a tough chance, but a chance nevertheless;
9.6;2;Parnell to Hussey, 2 runs Hussey again survives a mistimed hit, short on the off and he goes for the pull, doesn't get the distance he desires, lands safe, between the converging long-on and deep midwicket, two more;

9.3;6;Parnell to Watson, SIX runs that's been hammered, he's been superb at spotting these short ones quick, pulls that high and handsome and long, over deep square leg, raises another half-century, some form he's in;

9.1;1;Parnell to Watson, 1 run on a length first up outside off, driven uppishly towards long-off for a single;
8.6;1;Botha to Watson, 1 run superb fielding from JP Duminy, he was running to his right from deep midwicket, for a moment it seemed Watson had bisected that gap between Duminy and deep square leg but JP threw himself to his right, and in the end managed to keep them down to just a single, should have been for in Watson's mind;
8.6;1w;Botha to Watson, 1 wide flighted outside leg and he goes for the sweep, tries to sweep it fine, misses but it's called a wide, that spun down;

8.4;1;Botha to Hussey, 1 run shortish on the off, eased through to deep cover for one more;

7.3;1;Peterson to Watson, 1 run shortish, punched hard off the back foot towards extra cover, a fumble allows them a sinlge;
7.2;4;Peterson to Watson, FOUR runs Watson's put that behind him in no time, short and he's rocked back to punish that over midwicket;
7.1;?;Peterson to Watson, no run big appeal for lbw, looked close, that went on straight it seemed, angling in towards middle and leg, no turn there, would it have gone down leg? Hmm, tough to say, Watson missed as he came forward to defend, looked mighty close;
6.6;1;Botha to Watson, 1 run slightly flat this time on the pads, worked wide of short fine for a quick single;
6.6;1w;Botha to Watson, 1 wide Botha's turn to slide the ball down the leg side this time, called a wide;
6.5;4;Botha to Watson, FOUR runs seizes the length early there, rocked back upon release and dealt with it, short and it's pulled away hard over midwicket for a one bounce four;

5.6;1;Morkel to Watson, 1 run another one on the pads, full on middle and leg and that was flicked too, but towards a deep square leg this time, so just the single;
5.5;4;Morkel to Watson, FOUR runs bad ball from Morkel, a full toss, and worse, it's on the pads, flicked away with ease past short fine leg, easy pickings;
5.4;1;Morkel to Hussey, 1 run straying on leg and Hussey was looking to clip it into the leg side, gets a leg-bye in front of square leg;
5.3;1;Morkel to Watson, 1 run width again, this time it's cut down towards third man for a single;
5.2;4;Morkel to Watson, FOUR runs shot, pitched up on the off, he's forward, to the pitch and stylishly drives that past a diving extra cover, wide of mid-off, for a boundary;
5.1;4;Morkel to Watson, FOUR runs and he errs in length this time, short and wide, much like Kallis in the previous over and Watson makes it two in two, there's plenty of width for him to blaze that through point;
4.6;1;Kallis to Watson, 1 run shortish on middle, whipped wide of midwicket into the deep to keep the strike;
4.5;?;Kallis to Watson, no run short of a good length at 127.1 kmph, punched back towards the bowler;

4.2;1;Kallis to Watson, 1 run another single, this time it's pushed in front of mid-on for one more;
4.2;1w;Kallis to Watson, 1 wide faint appeal for lbw, shortish outside leg stump and Watson tried to help it on its way fine but missed, may just have flicked his shirt sleeve, but the umpire reckoned that was a wide;
4.1;4;Kallis to Watson, FOUR runs and Kallis is thrashed first ball, short, he's not as pacy as Steyn and there was also some width, Watson smacks that between point and cover, doesn't waste that;
3.6;1;Morkel to Watson, 1 run shortish on middle, gets on the back foot and pushes it to mid-on for a single, nicely done;
3.5;1;Morkel to Hussey, 1 run fullish again but on leg stump and Hussey has no trouble just dropping it in front of mid-on and stealing another single;

3.3;1w;Morkel to Hussey, 1 wide down the leg side this time and he appeals in vain, Hussey tried to glance that down but made no contact, the umpire calls it a wide;
3.2;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run drops that short on middle and off, rocks back and knocks that one down into the off side;
3.1;W;Morkel to Warner, OUT Gets him! Warner goes, Warner, keen to attack after a quiet first three overs, made some room to go over the top, landed slightly short of a good length on leg and middle, he was aiming to go over extra cover, appeared to get a thin edge but straight onto the stumps, South Africa have struck early;David Warner b Morkel 5 (15m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
2.6;?;Steyn to Watson, no run beaten as he goes for a drive, not quite there though to hit, around a good length and he rocks forward, but not to the pitch, to drive it through cover, it nips away to beat him;
2.6;1w;Steyn to Watson, 1 wide drops that one short outside off, a touch too short that and the umpire isn't going to spare that one, called a wide;
2.5;1;Steyn to Warner, 1 run there is protection in the deep, holds it back this time, pulled from outside off towards deep midwicket for a single;
2.4;1;Steyn to Watson, 1 run again short of a good length on off and middle, gets forward and defends it wide of midwicket for a single, steady going this;
