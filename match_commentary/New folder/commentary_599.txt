Data
Lee finishes with 4 for 66 and NZ ed on a disappointing 270, after opting to bat. Their batsmen needed to find form after Brisbane but with the exception of Redmond, the rest failed to capitalise. It's time for Scott Styris to change his mind and come out of Test retirement.
The Australian seamers really stifled the batsmen and Johnson deserves a lot of credit for peppering them with bouncers.
Matthew: "Last four wickets couldnt survive 10 overs this morning and added 8 runs. Truly pathetic from New Zealand. I don't care how well the guys are bowling, the call for franklin against west indies is getting louder all the time after his double ton this week."

 Innings Start
Australia lead by 265 and are now in a position from which they shouldn't lose. New Zealand have time on their hands so it's imperative they approach their second innings with patience, even if it makes for boring cricket. Haddin's innings, following the pressure on him to perform, should inspire them.
Prashant Krishnan is delighted for Haddin: 'In this match, I think Haddin has done nothing less than Gilchrist would have. His catching has been great and his batting has made the difference of 150 runs in the lead for Australia- the difference between a good and a dominating position. He came in at a time when Australia were in an uncertain situation- the lead looked just about 100 then. Stick to it mate!"

 Innings Start
Australia complete the whitewash and they'll be a much relieved bunch after a forgettable series in India. They took a bit of time to adjust back to home conditions and they've certainly clicked in all departments here in Adelaide. Except for Hayden and Symonds, the rest have contributed well with the bat. Lee may not have finished with his best innings figures but he still managed five wickets and he'll be delighted with that. The Australians have an extended break before the first Test at Perth against South Africa on the 17th.
And now the stat you've all been waiting for. Brett Lee is the only bowler to have taken more than 300 Test wickets without taking six or more wickets in an innings. Thanks Siddhartha Talya, for verifying that for me.
We're ready for the presentation.
Brad Haddin is the Man of the Match. "Very satisfying, we're just looking forward to the South Africa series. Clarke just decides not to talk during the partnership (laughs)."
Michael Clarke is the Man of the Series "Fantastic performance from the Australians. I'll take a 100 any day. Always great to come back and bat here at the Oval. Haddin was fantastic and he deserves the reward. He's the type of player who will win a lot of games for Australia."
Here's Vettori: "Disappointing all the way through. Australia put the game away from us a long long way yesterday. Australia won every critical moment through the Tests and we failed to do that. We have to get back to winning ways soon."
Ponting: "I enjoyed that catch (to get rid of How). I said to the guys after Brisbane there was a fair bit of room for improvement. Like Clarke said Haddin has a rosy future. We've got a great challenge ahead against South Africa. Lee kept wanting the ball and he ran in and picked nine."
Ponting gets hold of the series trophy and his team-mates join him. Don't forget New Zealand return in February for a series of five ODIs and a Twenty20. The first match is a day-nighter at the WACA on February 1.
So NZ have plenty to ponder after this heavy defeat. Sadly, John Bracewell leaves his post in disappointment and he would have hoped for much better farewell. We wish him all the best for his future. Andy Moles takes over as coach.
NZ have to get their batting in order. They were also missing their best player Jacob Oram to injury. I've said this before and will say it again - they will have to beg Scott Styris to come out of Test retirement. They've already lost a few players to the ICL and can't afford any more losses.
That's it from us. I enjoyed bringing the two Tests to you. Thanks for the mails. On behalf of my team, Raghav, Peter English and Brydon Coverdale, this is Kanishkaa Balachandran signing off. Cheers!
