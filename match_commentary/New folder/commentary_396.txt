14 off the last over and that completes a fine comeback having been 96 for 6. David Hussey has shown that if you stick around there are runs in this pitch. He played a fabulously controlled innings and has set up a solid total, not a huge total but on this wicket a huge score isn't required you wouldn't have though. But you can only judge a pitch until both teams have played on it and England will be chasing 201 to win after tea and George will be back with you then...

22.2;?;Broad to Clarke, no run has that hit Clarke's inside edge? England have no reviews left. No inside edge. The ball jagged from a good length into the right-hander and beat Clarke's forward push. That hit him in line with middle stump and would have knocked over leg stump.

5.2;W;Finn to Forrest, OUT and he's now the old batsman. That looks plumb. Finn is keeping the ball very full, and this time he moves it back into the right-hander. Forrest prodded from his crease and was smacked flush on the back pad. He has a quick word with Watson, presumably about a review, and then marches right off. That ball was smashing into off and middle.;Peter Forrest lbw b Finn 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
5.1;W;Finn to Warner, OUT a huge appeal for lbw but the umpire is unmoved. England have asked for a review. The ball was full and straight. Warner should have been playing forward but he wasn't. He hasn't played forward to anything today. He tried to close the face of the bat this time and play towards square, he missed and was struck plumb in front. That ball pitched on leg and middle and was going to hit middle. Plumb.;David Warner lbw b Finn 2 (21m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10.52;

 Innings Start
England have the series then, can they make it 4-0? Find out on Tuesday for the final match of this series from Old Trafford, 2pm start so join us then. Not the end of the cricket tonight though because West Indies are in action against New Zealand in Jamaica so head across to follow that game. But from me, Alex Winter, it's goodbye for now...

That's all from me today then, my thanks to George Binoy for his help with the coverage too. The other ESPNcricinfo George, Dobell, has penned today's match report and we've got plenty of reaction, analysis and photographs from Chester-le-Street.

Today the toss was crucial but England were so good with the ball, once again they ripped out the Australian top order and it was left to Michael Clarke to try and create something which he did. At least today, David Hussey stepped up in the middle order to put some sort of score on the board. But barring a new-ball rampage it was never going to be enough. England again laid good foundations and knocked off the runs so comfortably...

Presentation time. Steven Finn is the man of the match for his 4 for 37, a superb spell. "Since the new year it's been an amazing effort to not lose," says Alastair Cook. "The bowlers make my job easy, they know what they're doing. But we've got to keep working to keep those standards."

"Tough day," says Michael Clarke. "No doubt we've got plenty of work to do before the Ashes but our Test cricket has been more consistent than our one-day cricket."

So England take their ninth ODI victory in a row, that's a new record for them. They've also secured a seventh ODI series win at home in a row, also another record that this England team can lay claim to.

A comfortable chase and England win by eight wickets and absolutely hammer Australia, It was a super performance with the ball and a chase that was never in doubt...

2.50 pm Thank you, Alex. Australia have picked the right attack for this pitch and these conditions, though they'd have loved for the weather to be as overcast as it was when they batted this morning. They have four quicks to fall back on and if all radars are working, England might not have it easy during the chase.
Mark Kidger: "Plenty of fight from the Australian tail, but surely England will expect to get 201, even in difficult conditions? One of the top 3 has to get stuck in and stick around for a big score."
Brett Lee has the first new ball, and will sprint in from over the wicket. Alastair Cook and Ian Bell are opening for England.
