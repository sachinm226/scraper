Data
So Australia finish on 254, the same score they managed when these two sides last met here five years ago.
It been a good comeback by Bangladesh in the last 15 overs as just 101 runs came off it. Michael Clarke would have wanted more form his batsmen after that stand between Shaun Marsh and Michael Hussey had given them the perfect foundation but Australia should be able to defend this.

Toss and teams: Bangladesh have won the toss and they will bowl first.
Bangladesh: 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Mehrab Hossain jnr, 3 Mohammad Ashraful (capt), 4 Raqibul Hasan, 5 Shakib al Hasan, 6 Alok Kapali, 7 Dhiman Ghosh (wk), 8 Mashrafe Mortaza, 9 Abdur Razzak, 10 Nazmul Hossain, 11 Shahadat Hossain
Australia: 1 Shaun Marsh, 2 James Hopes, 3 Michael Hussey, 4 Michael Clarke (capt), 5 David Hussey, 6 Brad Haddin (wk), 7 Cameron White, 8 Mitchell Johnson, 9 Brett Geeves, 10 Nathan Bracken, 11 Stuart Clark
Well there you have it. Brett Geeves, the Tasmanian right-arm seamer, makes his ODI debut. Shane Watson is the 12th man. You may remember Geeves from the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL. A year ago, he was scouring the employment section of the Saturday newspapers as he feared being dumped by Tasmania following a disappointing 2006-07. As it turned out, he collected 37 first-class wickets the following season and was named Tasmania's Player of the Year. Good on you, Brett.
No major surprises in the Bangladesh squad.
8.50am: Good morning where ever you are and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the first of three one-dayers between Australia and Bangladesh in Darwin. I'm Kanishkaa, your companion for this match. Siddarth will join us later. If you missed the preview by Brydon Coverdale, read it here.
News just in - Andrew Symonds has been sent home from Darwin for some mysterious reason. Cricket Australia hasn't elaborated why, so your guess is as good as ours. We'll keep you informed when more news filters in.
At Cardiff in 2005, he wasn't allowed to play against Bangladesh after an overnight binge. Quite a notorious incident, and that was something he went on to deeply regret. That game, was incidentally Bangladesh's only victory against the world champions.
Back to this game. If you're in Australia and starved of live cricket, head over to Northern Territory, one of the few regions where the weather is good enough for international cricket. Cricket rarely comes to those parts so no matter who the opposition is, the atmosphere is bound to be entertaining. Australia are coming into this game after a lay-off so this gives Bangladesh their best opportunity to put up a fight. Australia are weakened by the loss of Ponting, Hayden to injury, Lee to family issues and Symonds to..... God knows what.
 Innings Start
Another good day's work for Australia. Another demoralising loss for Bangladesh. The visitors' bowlers did an acceptable job but the batting was woeful and the old problems of going for their shots too early persists.
Ashraful: If you lose five wickets in the first 20 overs, it's very difficult to come back. They bowled very well, good line and length. Our shot selection was poor.
Clarke is full of praise for the energy in the field and from the bowlers. He is also thrilled with the way the new boys like Brett Geeves and Shaun Marsh have stepped up.
Michael Hussey is named Man of the Match for his superbly paced 85.
Thanks for joining us. We hope you enjoyed our coverage. Do join us for the next match on Wednesday, September 3rd
