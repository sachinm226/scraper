Data
5.30pm: England have posted 300 but it was with something of a whimper, after they were 205 for 2 with 17 overs to go. We'll have to wait a couple of hours before we can properly evaluate James Taylor's hundred, I think - he certainly held England together, as wickets fell in the latter overs, but there will be plenty who think this is a below-par score. What is certain is that Taylor's hundred featured the least boundaries by an Englishman. England will be encouraged by the ball turning - they have two spinners in the side - but Australia will hope it skids on for them while chasing under lights. If so, Steven Smith's men will be confident of sealing the series... Join us in half an hour to see which way the cards fall.
49.6;1;Starc to Woakes, 1 run pitched up, Woakes backs away and drills the ball back along the ground, Starc gets a hand on it but can't prevent the single that sees England finish on a round 300;

Taylor is racing down the pitch regardless and he dives for his ground as Cumming tries to take a stump out of the ground!

Interesting move from Smith, bringing on Ashton Agar during the first Powerplay. Slip in for Ashton's first ball in ODIs
 Innings Start
England win by 93 runs and the series is back to 2-1. A impressive all-round display where England took advantage of winning the toss. James Taylor's maiden hundred anchored the innings, helped by Jason Roy and Eoin Morgan, then the spinners came to the fore. Rashid and Moeen were outstanding, as was England's fielding after a careless start in the first couple of overs. Australia lost their way after Smith and Finch fell to Rashid and quickly faded away. I'll bring you the presentation shortly.
Steven Smith "They got a few too many, we have away a few opportunities in the field. We dragged it back quite nicely. With the bat, the middle overs cost us. The wicket was getting a bit slower and it took a bit spin. We'll have to find ways to adapt. Thought Ashton bowled nicely on debut. And Maxwell has come a long way with his bowling. When you are chasing 300 you can't get too far behind the rate."
Eoin Morgan "Very impressed. We impressed in the areas I asked the guys for. Jason Roy played his game, strong down the ground. Me and James Taylor managed to get a nice partnership going. Probably got 20-30 than we would have liked, but knew the pitch would play into our hands. We want guys to make matchwinning contributions and James Taylor did that. I thought they [the spinners] were outstanding. We knew the new ball would set the tone because it was easier facing the new ball so Steve Finn was really impressive, then for the two spinners to bowl with such control I was not surprised but very impressed. There were some outstanding catches. [On Finn] He's like a leaping salmon at midwicket. Known him since he was 15 and never seen a catch like that."
The Man of the Match is James Taylor. "From a personal point of view it's always nice to put in a matchwinning performance. Conditions were tough, but Morgy played an exceptional knock which allowed me to knock it around. I knew I needed to kick on for the team, the man on my shoulder was telling me to play the big shot but knew I couldn't do that."
And that wraps it upfor tonight. It's all to play for at Headingley on Friday. We'll see you then. But for now, from Gnasher and Alan, it's goodbye and thanks for joining us,

42.2;1lb;Stokes to Pattinson, 1 leg bye an appeal for lbw, pitched outside leg, but there should have been run out. Throw went to the wrong end again. Just a little bit of chaos. And now they review the lbw. And, yes, it pitched miles outside leg.;

38.1;1;Ali to Starc, 1 run in the air again! Driven just wide of cover, Morgan can't get across;
37.6;W;Plunkett to Agar, OUT amazing! Roy holds what turns into a screamer. Agar launched this miles into the night sky and into the lights. Roy steadies himself at long on, but slightly misjudges it and the ball spills out as he falls backwards but, astonishingly, he is able to hold the rebound before the ball falls to the ground. A touch of fortune, yes, but some mind-boggling reflexes and awareness;Ashton Agar c Roy b Plunkett 5 (16m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;

28.4;?;Ali to Bailey, no run pushed through a bit quicker outside off, Bailey jumps out and defends;

27.6;?;Rashid to Marsh, no run pushed through quicker and he's trapped on the crease, up goes the finger! Marsh has a chat with George Bailey and asks for a review and, although he seemed to be pretty adjacent, Hawk-Eye shows that is was juuuuuuuuuuusssst missing off stump, straightening slightly too much - so Rob Bailey's decision is overturned and Marsh continues;

26.4;1;Ali to Marsh, 1 run comes forward and is off the mark first ball with a clip down the ground;
26.3;W;Ali to Maxwell, OUT tries a reverse dab this time, a top edge loops up and Bairstow takes a simple catch! Umpire Wilson slowly raises his finger and although Maxwell looks disgusted it is probably with the shot rather than the decision. It was more of a poke where the previous two attempts went fully through with the shot and the ball spooned off the toe, hit the arm and Bairstow didn't have far to go to complete the catch;Glenn Maxwell c ?Bairstow b Ali 17 (16m 12b 3x4 0x6) SR: 141.66;

25.2;1;Rashid to Bailey, 1 run tossed up, comes forward and drives wide of the catcher, Stokes diving after it, and down to long-off;
25.1;?;Rashid to Bailey, no run ugly long hop down the leg side from Rashid... but Bailey can only swipe it straight to short fine leg! Missed out there, even England's bad balls are becoming dots;
24.6;?;Ali to Maxwell, no run slow, on the stumps, Maxwell can only dink it into the leg side;
24.5;?;Ali to Maxwell, no run full, flighted outside off, Maxwell reverses the bat and sweeps, briefly in the air but short of the man on the edge of the ring;

22.6;?;Ali to Bailey, no run tossed up, spinning from off outside leg stump, Buttler collects and it's not called wide - maiden for Moeen;
22.5;?;Ali to Bailey, no run flighted around off stump and spinning in, can't get this one away to the leg side;
22.4;?;Ali to Bailey, no run flighted, reverses the hands this time, hit on the wrists;
22.3;?;Ali to Bailey, no run skips down once more, again it's too short for him to get to;
22.2;?;Ali to Bailey, no run Bailey leaves his crease early again, Moeen drags it down and the ball loops off the pads again as Bailey pulls out of the shot;
22.1;?;Ali to Bailey, no run tossed up outside off and spinning in as Bailey advances and is hit on the pad;
21.6;1;Rashid to Bailey, 1 run even slower, there's some turn again and an outside edge runs into a gap at cover to keep Bailey on strike;

21.4;W;Rashid to Finch, OUT Finch tries to tee off... and hits it straight up and down into the safe hands of Woakes running in from long-on! Rashid has a second, he's been a struggle to score off and Finch was trying to break the shackles, a moment of Hulk-like violence but he is soon slinking off looking more like Bruce Banner;Aaron Finch c Woakes b Rashid 53 (86m 60b 8x4 0x6) SR: 88.33;
21.3;?;Rashid to Finch, no run floated up on leg stump, turned to midwicket;

20.5;1;Ali to Finch, 1 run length ball, spinning in and deflected down the leg side;
20.4;?;Ali to Finch, no run some turn for Moeen, past the inside edge and it loops up off the pad... Bairstow does brilliantly to chase and catch with one hand but Joel Wilson correctly adjudges that there was no glove involved;
20.3;1;Ali to Bailey, 1 run angled in with the arm and Bailey again leaves the crease to on drive down the ground;
20.2;1;Ali to Finch, 1 run flighted, Finch plants the foot and pushes another single to long-on;

19.5;2;Rashid to Finch, 2 runs googly from Rashid and Finch gets a bit lucky, looking to launch down the ground, a thick inside edge bounces out towards wide mid-on, between two men... Just a couple and that takes him to a solid fifty on his return;
19.4;?;Rashid to Finch, no run tossed up and prodded defensively into the off side;
19.3;1;Rashid to Bailey, 1 run taps one more down the ground;

18.3;1;Plunkett to Finch, 1 run off-stump line, just a push down the ground from the ogre-strong Finch, long-on comes across to cut it off;
18.2;1;Plunkett to Bailey, 1 run pitched up and pushed through the covers coming forwards;
18.1;2;Plunkett to Bailey, 2 runs back of a length and turned through backward square... they come racing back for a second and the throw hits Finch as he runs his bat in. An English wag appeals for obstructing the field and there are grins all round;

15.6;1;Rashid to Bailey, 1 run uses his feet straightaway and drives down to long-off;
15.5;W;Rashid to Smith, OUT what a catch! Finn at short midwicket. Unusual position for him, but he's used his reach to great effect. Smith down the pitch, aimed a flick through the leg side, Finn flings himself to his right - almost horizontal - sticks out his right hand and holds a blinder.
