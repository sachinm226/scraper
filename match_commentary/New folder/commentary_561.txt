Data
So England finish with 435 and they'd be very happy with that result. The tail caused a few problems for Australia and put on nearly 100 this morning. Some quick runs from Graeme Swann, who ends up unbeaten on 47. The Australians have an uphill battle now to get a first-innings lead.
106.5;W;Hauritz to Panesar, OUT that's the end of the innings, Hauritz gets his third with a ball that drifts in and Panesar gets a thick edge to second slip;Monty Panesar c Ponting b Hauritz 4 (15m 17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.52;
106.4;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run another big shout, the ball doesn't turn and the Australians think it's been edged behind. Aleem Dar disagrees.;
106.3;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run lbw shout here for a ball that drifts in from the around-the-wicket line. Not out.;

106.1;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run defended comfortably;
106.1;2nb;Hauritz to Swann, (no ball) 1 run caught off a no-ball! Swann advances, Aleem Dar calls no-ball, and the batsman chips into the outfield where the catch is taken at deep midwicket by North. Oh dear, Nathan Hauritz;

105.5;?;Johnson to Panesar, no run safely left alone outside off once more;
105.4;?;Johnson to Panesar, no run shortish outside off and comfortably left alone;
105.3;?;Johnson to Panesar, no run slower ball almost does for Panesar, he chips it towards mid on but just checks his shot in time and Katich running in can't get there;
105.2;1;Johnson to Swann, 1 run pulled away confidently for a single;
105.1;1lb;Johnson to Panesar, 1 leg bye a big lbw shout from Johnson with a yorker that cannons into Panesar's pad, it was on the full and struck on line with leg. Billy Doctrove thought it was sliding down leg, though Hawkeye disagrees;
104.6;?;Hauritz to Swann, no run big turn this time, jags back into Swann, who keeps it out;
104.5;1;Hauritz to Panesar, 1 run oh, that's almost the end! Hauritz drifts one a long way outside off, it turns and Monty does a KP there, trying to sweep and the top-edge flies just over the head of Michael Clarke at slip;
104.4;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run no run, straighter this time, strikes pad and bat outside off;
104.3;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run a little turn now, edgily played away towards gully;
104.2;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run drifts it in nicely and Panesar defends;
104.1;1;Hauritz to Swann, 1 run and he does want it, with a clip through leg, there was never two in that so Panear is on strike;
101.6;1;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 1 run shuffles back and forces him square;
101.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run attempted yorker but it's too full, too wide;
101.4;1lb;Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 leg bye worked off his pads for a single;
101.3;4;Hilfenhaus to Swann, FOUR runs four down the ground! Classy, orthodox loft over the top and it very nearly goes for six;
101.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run down the leg side and worked off his pads;
101.1;1;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 1 run flicked to leg;
100.6;2;Hauritz to Swann, 2 runs patted out to the off side;
100.5;?;Hauritz to Swann, no run Swann charges Hauritz but the bowler asks to be invoiced first, and it's padded away;
100.4;1;Hauritz to Anderson, 1 run another reverse sweep, this time from Anderson! Can't time it;
100.3;4;Hauritz to Anderson, FOUR runs goes down for a sweep - not sure he got bat on it, but it's fairly flying down to fine leg. It's signalled runs, so four more!;
100.2;1;Hauritz to Swann, 1 run reaches forward and pats it out to cover;
100.1;2;Hauritz to Swann, 2 runs short, wide and cut out to deep extra cover;
103.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Panesar, no run on line this time but a perfectly straight-bat defence from Panesar;
103.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Panesar, no run solid defence outside off from Monty, who naturally gets another big cheer;
103.4;1;Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run that's a good yorker but well squeezed out by Swann and they scamper through;
103.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run backs away and advances, swinging at one outside off stump and misses the lot;
103.2;2;Hilfenhaus to Swann, 2 runs and Swann lofts cleanly over mid-on, comes back for an easy two and keeps the strike;
103.1;3;Hilfenhaus to Panesar, 3 runs a huge roar as Panesar clips one away off his pads and nearly gets a boundary but it's chased down just in time;
102.6;?;Hauritz to Swann, no run that is a magnificently odd shot from Swann, who switches around to become a left-hander and tries for a slog but misses;
102.5;?;Hauritz to Swann, no run;
102.4;W;Hauritz to Anderson, OUT down the pitch and he tries to lift him over mid-on but he can't - an easy catch for Hussey who jumps back and swallows it;James Anderson c Hussey b Hauritz 26 (69m 40b 2x4 0x6) SR: 65;
102.3;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run tries to smack him over midwicket but beaten by prodigious turn. Good stuff by Hauritz, giving the ball some air;
102.2;1;Hauritz to Swann, 1 run swept ungainly - flicking it, not unlike Pietersen's horror-shot yesterday;
102.1;1;Hauritz to Anderson, 1 run skips down the pitch, tries to smack him over the top but gets a thick outside edge...which falls short of point. Australia can't catch a break this morning;
99.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run defended to cover;
99.5;1;Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run too straight and worked for a single to leg;

99.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run;
99.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run on the back foot, pushed out to cover;
98.6;4;Hauritz to Swann, FOUR runs reverse-swept for four more! Brilliant from Swann, and Australia are beginning to lose the plot. That's England's 400 up too;
98.5;4;Hauritz to Swann, FOUR runs lifts this down the ground but mid-on will pick it up. Er, or not! Siddle's not picked it up and it goes for four - he only had two metres to move. The wheels are rapidly falling off;
98.4;4;Hauritz to Swann, FOUR runs down the pitch and Swann clouts him over mid-on for four. The fielder gives chase but drags it over the line - excellent, aggressive cricket;
98.3;?;Hauritz to Swann, no run tosses it up on middle-and-off and it spins into his pads;
98.2;?;Hauritz to Swann, no run more massive spin - off the good part of the pitch, too, not the rough;
98.1;4b;Hauritz to Swann, 4 byes huge turn, but down the leg side. Monty, are you watching? Swann has a wry grin as this one turns off middle stump and Haddin hasn't a chance;
97.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run beaten by a brute which lifts and leaves him at the last moment;
97.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run big shout - that's dead close as it moves back at the last moment but the umpire says no. How is that not-out? Pitched in line and looked like it was taking out middle-and-off;
97.4;1;Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run on the front foot, driving, and opening the face behind square;
97.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run cut out to the off side;
97.2;1;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 1 run smart cricket by Anderson, flicking it behind square for a single;
97.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run starts with a full delivery that's dug out;
96.6;?;Siddle to Swann, no run cracked to point;
96.5;2;Siddle to Swann, 2 runs outside off, Swann briefly thinks he's Viv Richards and pulls it through midwicket, but mistimes it. Nevertheless, England are absolutely on a roll here. It's one-day cricket;
96.4;3;Siddle to Anderson, 3 runs another fine shot. Another poor delivery. Outside off, Anderson flays his hands at it and scorches it through cover;
96.3;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run excellent delivery, spitting up at Anderson who jumps back and defends on the tips of his toes;
96.2;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run ooh edged, and just short of third slip. Better length from Siddle;
96.1;3;Siddle to Swann, 3 runs classily driven for three. He's really timed that well, too! It's poor bowling again from Siddle, though - a floaty half-volley, and Swann is no mug with the bat;
95.6;2lb;Johnson to Anderson, 2 leg byes ooh, that hurries him off the pads. But it flies through the slips! Johnson's close to blowing a gasket here, and the crowd are riling him and his team;
95.5;3;Johnson to Swann, 3 runs a short-arm pick-up over midwicket - England are flying here. 91mph on his legs and picked up cheekily;
95.4;?;Johnson to Swann, no run better ball on middle stump, shaping back, and it's defended;
95.3;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs driven on the up for four! Take that! Johnson's not happy, winging down some verbal half-volleys which are probably wasted on Swann, who plays his cricket as though each match is his last. Cracking shot;
95.2;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs well played. Opened the face and played it carefully, watchfully past the slips for four. No third man...;
95.1;?;Johnson to Swann, no run nudged off his pads;
94.6;1;Siddle to Swann, 1 run attempts a booming cover drive but gets a thick inside edge. They scamper a single as though their lives depend on it. And in some ways, that's true;
94.5;?;Siddle to Swann, no run that's a good nut too, cutting back sharply into Swann's pads;
94.4;?;Siddle to Swann, no run very good line. Siddle's struggled against the left-handers this morning and looks more comfortable against Swann, who plays and misses to one that shoots a bit low. Very low, in fact;
94.3;?;Siddle to Swann, no run better line and length, defended on the front foot;
94.2;3;Siddle to Anderson, 3 runs shot from Anderson, flicking his wrists like Azharuddin (? Gnasher) through midwicket. Excellent running yields three;
94.1;4;Siddle to Anderson, FOUR runs thick outside edge flies down to third man for four! Only two slips in place and it flies past them for four;
93.6;?;Johnson to Swann, no run on leg stump and defended;
93.5;W;Johnson to Broad, OUT bowled him! Johnson gets one on target at last and bowls Broad off his pads and around his legs;Stuart Broad b Johnson 19 (22m 20b 4x4 0x6) SR: 95;
93.4;1;Johnson to Anderson, 1 run nicely played, shuffling back and timing it past cover for a single;
93.3;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run another loose one down the leg side at 92mph;
93.2;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run good take - great snaffle by Haddin to a horrible stray from Johnson down the leg side;
93.1;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run short of a length, Anderson rocks back and gives himself room while defending chippily out to the off side;
92.6;?;Siddle to Broad, no run firmly blocked off the back foot;
92.5;?;Siddle to Broad, no run shuffles back and leaves it outside off;
92.4;4;Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs oh shot - shot! Off-driven for four, a "check" drive, not fully committing to it but nevertheless timing it past mid-off for four;
92.3;?;Siddle to Broad, no run better. Onto the front foot and he defends;
92.2;4;Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs thick outside edge, but played with soft hands and he'll get four for that. Not totally in control of that...;
92.1;?;Siddle to Broad, no run plays and misses outside off - very fine delivery, holding its line;
91.6;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run steps to leg and tries to clout him through extra cover but mistiming it;
91.5;1;Johnson to Broad, 1 run inside edge! That could've gone anywhere and very nearly destroyed Broad's stumps;
91.4;2;Johnson to Broad, 2 runs that's well played, forcing this good length delivery off the back foot;
91.3;?;Johnson to Broad, no run defended on the back foot;
91.2;?;Johnson to Broad, no run that's a snorter from Johnson - a real jagging, cutting, viper of a delivery that shot back off the seam and cut Broad in half;
91.1;3;Johnson to Anderson, 3 runs have some of that! That's the way tailenders should play. Short, wide and he clatters it over point. It's slightly mistimed, but an encouraging sign of intent;
90.6;?;Siddle to Broad, no run better line and defended on the back foot;
90.5;4;Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs my word. That's a beautiful shot - the most orthodox and creamy cover drive rockets across the turf for four. Superb shot;
90.4;?;Siddle to Broad, no run on the back foot, he's defending crisply off the back foot;
90.3;?;Siddle to Broad, no run touch too wide - a nice early-morning sighter for Broad;
90.2;?;Siddle to Broad, no run good line and length on off stump, Broad goes back to defend solidly on the back foot;
90.1;?;Siddle to Broad, no run Broad shuffles back to defend with a straight bat off the back foot;
89.6;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run on his legs, tucked behind square;
89.5;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run stroked confidently - elegantly, even - out to mid-off;
89.4;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run good, tight line on the off stump which is defended on the back foot out to cover;
89.3;2;Johnson to Anderson, 2 runs flayed out to the off side - timed that quite nicely, too. They only take two though;
89.2;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run Anderson steps to leg before guiding this off the back foot. Safely, comfortably played;
89.1;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run Anderson cracks him powerfully off the back foot;
88.6;?;Siddle to Broad, no run defended to backward point;
88.6;1w;Siddle to Broad, 1 wide wide again - well wide of the off stump. Ponting doesn't like it;
88.5;?;Siddle to Broad, no run shorter delivery, Broad's back and defending off the back foot;
88.4;4;Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs beautifully played. On the front foot, opens the face and defends it with an open face down to third man;
88.3;W;Siddle to Prior, OUT inswing back into the right-hander and he's bowled him! A fantastic delivery by Siddle - huge, late inswing and it forces its way through Prior's gate;Matt Prior b Siddle 56 (99m 62b 6x4 0x6) SR: 90.32;
88.2;?;Siddle to Prior, no run smartly blocked off the back foot;
88.1;?;Siddle to Prior, no run comes forward, tries to defend but is beaten by outswing. Unlucky again for poor old Siddle;
87.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run left alone outside off;
87.6;1w;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 1 wide wide - way, way too wide and it's eventually signalled as such by the umpire;
87.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run great delivery that cuts away at the last moment - that's brilliant from Hilfenhaus! Anderson, well, he hasn't a clue how to play that;
87.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run shuffles back and nervously turns it to leg;
87.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run big, booming inswing into Anderson, the left-hander;
87.2;1;Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run more swing, but guided out to the off side for a single;
87.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run brute of a delivery - a stunner! Late outswing away from Prior's drive;
86.6;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;
86.5;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run shuffles back, defends just short of short-leg;
86.4;W;Siddle to Flintoff, OUT bowled him! An horrid, angled bat as he tries to drive but gets a thick inside edge which hammers into his stumps;Andrew Flintoff b Siddle 37 (66m 51b 6x4 0x6) SR: 72.54;
86.3;?;Siddle to Flintoff, no run onto the front foot, defending solidly;
86.2;?;Siddle to Flintoff, no run defended on the front foot out to the off side. No chance of a single, though they think of it;
86.1;?;Siddle to Flintoff, no run defended on the front foot, the ball balloons out to the off side and Flintoff hasn't a clue where it's gone;
85.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run well bowled! A superb comeback! Outswinger beating the drive;
85.5;1;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, 1 run guides this out to the off side and Prior calls him through for a single - they'll have to be quick! Hilfenhaus screws up the fielding, however, and they're home;
85.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run very late on this good, straight delivery and nearly gets a thin inside edge;
85.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run he's laced that, standing tall and driving it with ugly brute force, but mid-off does brilliantly, diving to his right to field;
85.2;1;Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run blocked out to the off side for a quick single;
85.1;4;Hilfenhaus to Prior, FOUR runs four more - but not convincingly. Thick outside edge flies past the slips down to third man. Everything's going England's way at the moment;
84.6;?;Siddle to Flintoff, no run Flintoff shoulders arms with extravagance outside off;
84.5;1;Siddle to Prior, 1 run cuts it out to the off side for his ninth Test fifty, and what an attractive knock that's been. Timely for England, too - and from 54 balls. Impressive;
84.4;1;Siddle to Flintoff, 1 run a forcing, back-foot drive for a single;
84.3;1;Siddle to Prior, 1 run cuts it off the back foot, one hand coming off the bat;
84.2;4;Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs exceptional, thrashing cover-drive for four! One of the shots of the day, opening the face and absolutely smiting it for four. Not a great delivery;
84.1;4;Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs don't bowl there to Prior. Back cut for four - super, controlled, elegant shot. He's so strong outside the off stump: as good as anyone;
83.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run defended solidly to point;
83.5;1;Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run nudged to leg for another single;
83.4;2;Hilfenhaus to Prior, 2 runs gorgeous extra cover drive, though it'll be cut off by the man on the boundary;
83.3;1lb;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, 1 leg bye down the leg side and it doesn't straighten as much as he'd like. Turned for a single;
83.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run another very good outswinger is left alone;
83.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run a wild swing and a miss to an excellent, if slightly wide, outswinger;
82.6;1;Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run nudged to leg and Flintoff retains the strike with a nudge to leg;
82.5;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run just outside the off stump and he laces it - absolutely murders it! - but straight to long-off;
82.4;3;Johnson to Prior, 3 runs short of a length and pulled wide of mid-on, but not quite timed it as well as he might. Still - more aggressive intent shown by this pair, and the new-ball is flying all over the shop;
82.3;2;Johnson to Prior, 2 runs flicked to leg and placed for two;
82.2;1;Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run onto the front foot and defended out to the off side - excellent running and they get a single. Flintoff's beginning to run Australia a little ragged here. It's an adventurous, cheeky innings;
82.1;3;Johnson to Prior, 3 runs gorgeous extra-cover drive - and they'll get overthrows too. Ponting distinctly, emphatically unimpressed by the backing up. The double teapot isn't yet out, but give it time...the crowd are just beginning to wind up the Australians;
81.6;4;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, FOUR runs that's runs that is. Massive runs. Flintoff's most authoritative stroke today is pulled through midwicket with commanding power. Bosh!;

81.4;2;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, 2 runs shorter ball and pulled to leg;
81.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run forward onto the front foot, takes a thick outside edge which falls short of second slip. Soft hands - well, soft for Flintoff anyway;
81.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run a touch of late swing but Flintoff shuffles across to defend;
81.1;1;Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run late swing forces an error from Prior who tries to drive straight but gets a leading edge out to point;
80.6;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run solidly defended on the front foot;
80.5;1;Johnson to Prior, 1 run outside off, defended nicely out to cover for a quick single;

80.3;?;Johnson to Prior, no run a wild, wasted delivery miles wide of the off stump;
80.2;?;Johnson to Prior, no run encouraging late swing into Prior - big swing, in fact. Prior defends;
80.1;?;Johnson to Prior, no run well wide - a wild and woolly delivery that swings late back into the right-hander, but only after pitching;
79.6;1;Katich to Prior, 1 run beautiful square drive, opening the face;
79.5;1;Katich to Flintoff, 1 run short of a length and pulled but mistimed;
79.4;4;Katich to Flintoff, FOUR runs that's runs, that is. Tossed up, Flintoff waits for it and heavies it down the ground. Massive power down the ground - nearly cleans Prior up!;
79.3;?;Katich to Flintoff, no run again on the back foot, he then prods forward;
79.2;?;Katich to Flintoff, no run ooh quicker - well bowled! Flintoff's on the back foot and defends late;
79.1;4;Katich to Flintoff, FOUR runs back-cuts short of slip - for four! Didn't carry, but well bowled;
78.6;1;Hauritz to Flintoff, 1 run fuller, almost a yorker, and it's bunted to Hughes at deep midwicket who receives ironic applause for fielding it cleanly this time;
78.5;1;Hauritz to Prior, 1 run wide of the off stump, Prior gives himself room and pats it wide of point;
78.4;?;Hauritz to Prior, no run tossed up on middle, Prior's forward, smotheringq;
78.3;1;Hauritz to Flintoff, 1 run tickled around the corner. Nicely played;
78.2;1;Hauritz to Prior, 1 run shorter delivery tucked to leg;
78.1;4;Hauritz to Prior, FOUR runs a flat, powerful sweep for four! That was timed with great power. Hughes at deep midwicket couldn't save it - immense muscle in that shot;
77.6;?;Katich to Flintoff, no run spins back into Flintoff who defends on the back foot;
77.5;?;Katich to Flintoff, no run full toss, patted to mid-off;
77.4;?;Katich to Flintoff, no run tossed wider of the off stump and left alone;

76.2;?;Hauritz to Flintoff, no run left alone outside off;
76.1;1;Hauritz to Prior, 1 run Prior gives himself room, defending it with purpose down to long-on;
75.6;4;Johnson to Flintoff, FOUR runs savaged through cover for four. Flintoff at his most caveman-like. Outside off and he plants his feet like an oil rig steadying itself in the north sea, then flays him for four. The ball bounces twice and thuds into the boundary boards;
75.5;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run on middle, Flintoff is back and defending with the straightest of bats;
75.4;1;Johnson to Prior, 1 run guided out to the off side, and guided powerfully too;
75.3;?;Johnson to Prior, no run 89.9mph outside off, and it beats Prior's drive;
75.2;?;Johnson to Prior, no run slower delivery, punched to leg;
75.1;4;Johnson to Prior, FOUR runs thick outside edge falls short of the slips and goes for four. Not a chance, it was played down and late, but still quite fortuitous;
74.6;?;Hauritz to Flintoff, no run defended on the front foot. My word, he looks so uncomfortable against spin...;
74.5;?;Hauritz to Flintoff, no run lunges forward and nudges to leg;
74.4;4;Hauritz to Flintoff, FOUR runs that's a lovely shot from Flintoff. Elegant, even. Poor ball outside off and Flintoff cuts it hard. Way, way too short;
74.3;1;Hauritz to Prior, 1 run turned to leg;
74.2;1;Hauritz to Flintoff, 1 run on the sweep and powerfully struck;

72.5;4;Hauritz to Flintoff, FOUR runs lunges forward and gets an inside edge - for four! Only Flintoff could manage that.;

72.3;2;Hauritz to Prior, 2 runs steps to leg and back-cuts it hard, extravagantly;
72.2;1;Hauritz to Flintoff, 1 run onto the back foot and flicked to leg;
72.1;?;Hauritz to Flintoff, no run Flintoff lunges forward, like an old man leaning on his walking stick. He looks so ill at ease playing spin;

71.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run chopped down to the off side;
70.6;?;Hauritz to Flintoff, no run lunges forward and pushes it out to the off side;
70.5;W;Hauritz to Pietersen, OUT got him! A terrible shot from Pietersen, trying to sweep this from miles outside off without getting down into position, and he top edges it meekly straight into the hands of a delighted Katich at short-leg;Kevin Pietersen c Katich b Hauritz 69 (196m 141b 4x4 0x6) SR: 48.93;

68.5;?;Siddle to Prior, no run more inswing and well defended on the back foot;
68.4;4;Siddle to Prior, FOUR runs the inswinger and Prior gets bat on it. Well - he gets a lot of bat on it in fact, timed the underwear off it for four. That ball really is booming around;
68.3;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run steps outside off and flicks to leg;
68.2;3;Siddle to Prior, 3 runs classily driven off the back foot, though lacking perfect timing;
68.2;1nb;Siddle to Prior, (no ball) superb delivery! Cuts away markedly on the right hander who fishes and misses. Haddin loves it. So does Siddle. So do I. Fine delivery;

67.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;

67.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run cuts away and left alone;
67.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run flayed and is that dropped? Clarke at short extra cover and he dived forward and to his right...but couldn't cling on. It was a real grass-cutter - only half a chance really;
66.6;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run sat up nicely and he pulled it massively, but straight to deep square leg;
66.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run on the back foot, played back to the bowler;
66.4;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run defended chippily back to the bowler;
66.3;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run and this one holds its line, Pietersen again beating playing inside the line. This is great stuff from Siddle;

64.6;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run defended solidly;

64.1;1;Siddle to PD Collingwood, 1 run flicked to leg;
63.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run inswinging yorker - that's damn close! Quick delivery and the ball balloons to the slips who appeal for both lbw and a catch. That is so, so close! It looked like he got an edge, onto his boot, and the lbw was good too;
63.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run ignored outside off;
63.4;4;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, FOUR runs fantastic shot. Wide of the off stump and somehow Pietersen threads it through extra cover, in spite of the packed off-side field, flinging his hands at it and timing it massively. Top, top shot!;
63.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run again, wide of the off stump. That seems to be the tactic here;

60.2;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run on his legs, tries to whip through midwicket but can't get bat on ball - an intrinsic necessity of batting;
60.1;1b;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 bye oh dear - a big inswinger down the leg side and Haddin palms it to fine-leg;
59.6;?;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, no run beaten. Terrific nut, that, swinging away very late on Collingwood who fishes and misses;

59.1;3;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, 3 runs short, wide and cracked off the back foot. Stiff, sleepy delivery by Hilfenhaus;
58.6;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run driven to midwicket, slightly edgily, and a lightning fast Ponting turns and throws at the bowler's end. Not sure why.;
58.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run yorker, well bowled, but kept out with ease;
58.4;1;Siddle to PD Collingwood, 1 run pushed to mid-off, they take off for a quick single, Johnson's throw misses the stumps and with a belly-flop dive into his crease, Collingwood brings up his half-century from 125 balls;

55.2;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run driven to cover and there's no run;
55.1;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run width once again but this attempted cut comes off the under-edge and slams into the turf, bouncing up to slip;
54.6;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run faster ball to Pietersen, who punches to mid-on;

And it's time for some pace once again, Peter Siddle will take up the attack from the Cathedral Road End. Just one slip in place.
 Innings Start
And with that comes the declaration. So Australia have played magnificently to build a lead of 239. North and Haddin were wonderful today. Now it's on England's top order to make the pitch look as placid as their Australian counterparts. Haddin raced off the field at the declaration and Ponting had a look of sheer determination on his face, they are desperate not to let this enormous chance slide. England will have just over half an hour to bat before tea.
180.6;W;PD Collingwood to Haddin, OUT and finally, something for the England fans to cheer. Haddin goes over the top again, trying for a six out to midwicket and Bopara takes the catch.;Brad Haddin c Bopara b Collingwood 121 (200m 151b 11x4 3x6) SR: 80.13;

180.4;1;PD Collingwood to Haddin, 1 run flicked off his pads to square leg;
180.3;4;PD Collingwood to Haddin, FOUR runs in the air, heaved over midwicket and Bopara running back can't quite make enough ground and it bounces over the rope. Typifies England's day, really;

178.5;2;PD Collingwood to Haddin, 2 runs turned off his pads;
178.4;6;PD Collingwood to Haddin, SIX runs and again, but this time straighter, longer and with greater power! Schwing! Six over long-on;
178.3;4;PD Collingwood to Haddin, FOUR runs top shot! Half volley and he clubs it leg-side as though playing in a charity match;
178.2;1;PD Collingwood to North, 1 run nudged off his pads and there's Australia's 650. Six hundred and fifty for five. Good grief;
178.1;1;PD Collingwood to Haddin, 1 run flicked to fine leg and there's his hundred! Great celebration for a great hundred, an innings full of style, determination and elegance. Superb knock;

171.6;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run quality - lovely little loft but just didn't time it sufficiently. Falls short of long-on;
171.5;2;Swann to Haddin, 2 runs down the wicket and lofts it into the mass of space at midwicket;
171.4;3;Swann to North, 3 runs beautiful little dab down to third man, and Monty receives the day's biggest applause for chasing after a red ball and winging in a throw;

170.6;1;Panesar to North, 1 run turned to leg for a single;

170.4;1;Panesar to Haddin, 1 run again, another leading edge which flies out to the off side - and there's Panesar's hundred! An innings full of strays and not many edges. Well played sir;
170.3;?;Panesar to Haddin, no run squared up - lovely ball. Angled on leg stump and it turns away;
170.2;?;Panesar to Haddin, no run what a ball - that turned and spat out of the rough, beating Haddin's massive swipe and flying to slip;

169.6;?;Swann to Haddin, no run pushed out to the off side;
169.5;?;Swann to Haddin, no run down the leg side, appeal. Prior whips off the bails and appeals. Appealing all over the shop;

168.6;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run gives himself room, slapping it square;
168.5;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs nonchalant! Rotten bowling from Anderson I'm afraid, but what a shot - on his legs, Haddin just walked into a flick over midwicket. Touch of Mark Waugh about that stroke;
168.4;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs edged and short of Prior! A false late-cut but falls just short of Prior who can only parry it for four;
168.3;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs a rank long-hop is cut ferociously hard. As it should have been;
168.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run wild and woolly down the leg side. Again, a good stop by Prior to his left - his keeping has been relievingly anonymous this Test, so far;

167.6;?;Flintoff to North, no run down the leg side;
167.5;1;Flintoff to Haddin, 1 run a mistimed flogging slog to mid-on;

167.2;1;Flintoff to North, 1 run short, wide and crashed to deep backward point;

165.2;1;Flintoff to Haddin, 1 run and Haddin gets in on the celebrations with a half-century. Very quick single pushed into the off side, the third umpire was called to check whether North diving in had his bat in the air, he didn't, and Haddin raises the bat;
165.1;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run no shot required, no shot offered outside off;
164.6;?;Anderson to North, no run on the pads, pushed back down the pitch;
164.5;?;Anderson to North, no run no swing here from Anderson, he's probably banging it in a touch too short, North defends;
164.4;?;Anderson to North, no run solid in defence, back on task immediately;
164.3;2;Anderson to North, 2 runs and there it is! Marcus North brings up his century by guiding a two behind point and dives back in for the second;
164.2;2;Anderson to North, 2 runs leg side again, North glances away behind square again, and he moves to 98;
164.1;2;Anderson to North, 2 runs on the pads, nicely clipped away through midwicket for a couple of runs;
163.6;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run good ball to end the over, some movement away, Haddin looks to play then decides to leave;
163.5;4;Flintoff to Haddin, FOUR runs and Haddin shows what he thinks of a new ball, backing away and giving himself room, one-day style, and he cuts it powerfully behind point;
163.4;1;Flintoff to North, 1 run wide outside off, North cuts it to the man at deep point;
163.3;?;Flintoff to North, no run solid in defence this time;
163.2;4;Flintoff to North, FOUR runs not quite where North intended to play that one! He's shaped to cut, then he's tried to leave it and in the process it's somehow flown off the middle of the bat and between second slip and gully to get him into the nineties;
163.1;1;Flintoff to Haddin, 1 run that's a loosener from Flintoff, shortish outside off and Haddin punches through cover;
162.6;?;Panesar to North, no run thoughts of a quick single there as North prods to off but Haddin is vociferous in his call of no;
162.5;?;Panesar to North, no run left alone outside off;
162.4;?;Panesar to North, no run shouts of 'catch it' here as it bobs up off North's pad and towards slip, Collingwood actually spilled it but there was no bat involved anyway;
162.3;?;Panesar to North, no run turns in a bit sharper this time, off the pads;
162.2;1;Panesar to Haddin, 1 run Haddin gets into the cutting mood as well, just a fraction too short perhaps from Monty;
162.1;3;Panesar to North, 3 runs an enormous leap from Monty as North cuts it away behind point, no chance of a wicket, but my that was impressive how far off the ground Panesar lifted himself;
161.6;?;Swann to Haddin, no run off the back foot and punched to the leg side;
161.5;?;Swann to Haddin, no run turns it in to Haddin's pads, he defends;

161.3;?;Swann to North, no run pushed away safely again;
161.2;4;Swann to North, FOUR runs that's not North's prettiest shot but it was effective. Too short and wide, and North reached from his standing position to cut forward of point;
161.1;?;Swann to North, no run on off stump, not much turn, North pushes it away;
160.6;?;Panesar to Haddin, no run forward in defence once again;

 Innings Start
Don't forget to read the bulletin which is being desperately cobbled as I speak. We'll have a whole load of pieces, too, so keep your eyes peeled on our dedicated Ashes series page (RSS feed for those who want it) and video highlights of an extraordinary final session (UK only, I'm afraid). From me, Will Luke, join us on Thursday for the second Test. The Ashes are well and truly alive.
Ponting wins man of the match. He's booed. "I'd give this back straight away for another wicket," he chirps. He looks in good fettle, smiling away, not too peeved. He thinks England "did a good job," and almost grimaces while saying it. Australia "can be proud" of how they performed and he won't be pressed on his side's chances on retaining the urn. "We're not jumping to any conclusions and we have to play at the level we played in this game if we're to win."
Briefly, here are the post-match presentations. Huge cheers for Strauss. "All credit to Paul Collingwood. What a knock that was. He does it time and time again. Outstanding. But also the two at the end, Monty and Jimmy"...cue applause..."They showed a lot of character and fight and thankfully it's still nil all. We recognise there's a lot to work on for Lord's." Changes? "Not sure. We'll name the squad tomorrow afternoon and think with calm heads [about who we choose]...it's a huge lift, momentum is everything for us [but] we need to play better. We're just very, very thankful and proud for the fight we showed today."
We'll have the post-match gubbins for you shortly. For those of you now wanting to celebrate and switch off your screens, fair thee well, and thanks for joining us this past five days. And don't forget to join us for Lord's which gets underway on Thursday. I'm Will Luke and my thanks to Brydon Coverdale who's joined me from Australia throughout - join us both for what we expect to be another thrilling encounter in just a few days time. Until then, go well.
This place has exploded! Australia cannot believe it, and every man in this ground is standing, applauding, cheering England's effort. Panesar can't wipe the smile off his face, and Australia, it's fair to say, look peeved, tired, exhausted and chastened. It's quite an unbelievable scene. "Tricky last couple of hours for us there," understates Anderson. "Amazing batting what he did today," says Monty of Collingwood. Moving on, quickly. But no, let's focus on Collingwood - an innings of such determination and grit to dig England out of a monumental hole.
104.6;1b;Hauritz to Anderson, 1 bye wide of the off stump, off the pads and balloons over the slips. They run a bye. They run a bye. Ponting scratches his chin, he looks distraught. Anderson talks to the umpires. No one knows what's going on! But they shake hands and England have drawn! It's all over!;
104.5;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run drifts in, darts in on middle. Blocked. Blocked.;
104.4;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run huge turn for once but it's too wide. It's too wide from Hauritz;
104.3;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run tosses this up on the middle stump and he's forward. It prompts more emphatic, cacophonous cheer from the crowd. And then silence;
104.2;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run flighted on middle and defended;
104.1;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run quicker ball on leg stump, nudged to leg. Cardiff explodes, then a hushed silence;

103.5;?;North to Panesar, no run edged, short of slip. Soft hands from Panesar. Slowish turn;
103.4;?;North to Panesar, no run tense from North. Left alone. Too wide. Way, way too wide. Cardiff explodes;

103.1;?;North to Panesar, no run comes forward and gets a bit of backspin on it as he defends. Cardiff erupts. Cardiff goes silent;
102.6;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run quicker ball! Well bowled! Blocked. Cardiff explodes once more and this time it's not followed by silence. The noise here!;
102.5;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run full toss, pushed out to the off side;
102.4;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run that's well bowled but Hauritz is tensing up. Not really spinning it any more. Cardiff explodes with delight then a hushed whisper as Hauritz comes in once more;
102.3;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run blocked again on the front foot. Cardiff explodes. Cardiff goes quiet. Silent.;
102.2;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run blocked once more. Cardiff erupts. Then silence.;
102.1;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run blocked off the back foot. The roof's off again! The noise is just wonderful;

101.3;?;North to Panesar, no run defended on the front foot;
101.2;4;North to Panesar, FOUR runs four! Panesar's crashed him square of the wicket for four! Ponting can't believe it. Monty can't believe it. I certainly can't believe it;
101.1;1;North to Anderson, 1 run cracked in the air square of the wicket - where's this gone? It lands safe! It's safe, but the pair crash into eachother mid-pitch while staring at the ball;
100.6;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run wide of the off stump, prodigious turn and bounce;
100.5;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run wonderful ball but well played. On the off stump and defended;

99.6;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run solidly played off the back foot to defend;
99.5;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run good leave again. Angled across the left hander and he shoulders arms, lifting his bat high into the sky;

99.3;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run short, ducks out of the way.;
99.2;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run a massive cheer goes up as Monty's behind it on the back foot;
99.1;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run on his legs and Siddle lets out just about the best appeal I've seen all year. Rapped on the pad but sliding down leg. Sheesh, that was quick - 92mph and must have felt like 110mph! Siddle implored, begged the umpire with both hands;
98.6;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run tossed up on middle and defended once more;
98.5;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run smothered. Smothered on the front foot. What smothering.;
98.4;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run oh - oh bowled! Well bowled! Cracking offbreak beats everything;
98.3;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run patted out to the off side. Monty wants a single! Anderson tells him to bog off;
98.2;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run oh well bowled. So slow. Looped on middle and Anderson was a bit fast on it but guided it nevertheless;
98.1;1;Hauritz to Panesar, 1 run guided out to the off side - Anderson gets the strike. Well played Panesar. Ponting not happy!;
97.6;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run defended once more;
97.5;4;Siddle to Anderson, FOUR runs four more. Cardiff is exploding. It's official. Another bizarre, squirty, squeezy, jabby off-side stroke sneaks through like pickpocket on Oxford Street;
97.4;4;Siddle to Anderson, FOUR runs four! Four runs! Jabbed out, squeezing it through the slips - the roof's coming off here! Australia have to bat again but more importantly, they'll deduct two overs;
97.3;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run defended solidly;
97.2;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run ever so slightly fuller. Guided out to point. "No," is the Lancastrian's call;
97.1;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run ooh wide of the off stump and hits a crack, missing Anderson's drive and nearly flying over Haddin. Brilliant! Brilliant take by him. That could've been four byes;
96.6;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run massive turn outside off! Huge, ripping turn but Panesar survives;
96.5;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run yes, a little quicker and wider and he fishes and misses. Big turn;

96.3;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run flighted and he clamps down;
96.2;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run beaten by a beauty turning away from Panesar. Bowled, Hauritz. Guts from this bowler!;
96.1;?;Hauritz to Panesar, no run full on middle. Monty bat-pads. Haddin appeals like a girl. I yelp.;
95.6;1;Siddle to Panesar, 1 run tickled down to fine leg - they're taking the single. I'd suggest that's good for Australia;
95.5;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run short and angled into the left-hander who defended on the back foot out to the off side. Monty wants a run! Oh good grief man, what are you doing? Anderson sends him back, Monty gives him the thumbs up, Strauss puts his head in his hands and mutters "for God's sake.";

95.3;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run fuller and squeezed out to point;
95.2;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run jumps back to this short delivery and defends with extravagance! Go on, Monty - have a go! That's the spirit.;
95.1;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run Panesar is forward, defending. The crowd cheer as one!;
94.6;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run solid on the front foot. Solid from Anderson. Clamps down on the front foot. This is as tense a game as I've covered for a very long time;
94.5;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run rapped on the back pad - not out. Arm ball hasn't turned enough. But wonderful bowling nevertheless. Variation in line, length and pace - great stuff!;
94.4;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run flighted on the off stump, it spits and turns - Haddin appeals but it's nowhere near the bat. Beautiful delivery by the offspinner who apparently can't bowl offspin;
94.3;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run pushed out to the off side;
94.2;?;Hauritz to Anderson, no run ooh that's close! That's very close! Nearly loses his off stump;

93.6;1;Siddle to Anderson, 1 run plays that late down to fine leg and steals the strike;
93.5;1;Siddle to Panesar, 1 run on his legs and tucked to midwicket for a single. Monty wants two! Get back, get back son!;
93.4;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run edged him, has he? No! Thought I heard an edge. Monty's all over the shop, feet were nowhere;
93.3;W;Siddle to PD Collingwood, OUT he's dropped him, has he? Parries it - no he's caught him! Collingwood is out! He went back, trying to force it off the back foot but edged it high to Hussey at gully who parried it above his head, and he clung on the second time;Paul Collingwood c Hussey b Siddle 74 (344m 245b 6x4 0x6) SR: 30.2;
93.2;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run defended on the back foot;
93.1;1;Siddle to Anderson, 1 run Anderson gets a single with a tuck to mid-on, though he has to get his skates on - and some! They both do. Collingwood's smiling - he's a masochist, that man;
92.6;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run clunked to cover. No run. Anderson on strike now;
92.5;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run back onto his stumps and defending to leg;
92.4;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run big, ripping turn - ooh this is good, good bowling from Hauritz. Found his length at last. Collingwood not looking settled. That defensive poke could've gone anywhere;
92.3;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run padded away. Half a shout. Can't give that;
92.2;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run pats forward and defends, off the glove, and that falls short of silly point! Ponting is right there under Collingwood's nose;
92.1;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run tossed up. That's got snow on it! Blocked on middle;
91.6;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run edged short of second slip! Much better delivery, at last attacking the stumps. Fell comfortably short, mind;
91.5;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run ooh a good slower ball! Very well bowled. Too wide, mind you;
91.4;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run good leave to a good lifter - too wide, though, from Johnson again;
91.3;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run but a good comeback from Johnson here as he passes the outside edge of Anderson's fishy waft!;
91.2;4;Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs Johnson drops it short - filthy delivery I'm afraid. Short, wide and absolutely smashed for four square of the wicket. Hammered!;
91.1;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run lovely shot square of the wicket but well fielded - a hustling dive to his right by somebody or other. Sorry. Can't see.;
90.6;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run solidly defended;
90.5;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run ooh, backspin from Collingwood! Nervous, tentative shot which spins back to Haddin;

90.3;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run defended solidly this time;
90.2;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run comes forward and raps him on the pad - that's mighty close. Is he playing a shot? Not really! Outside the line. Just. Ahem.;
90.1;3;Hauritz to Anderson, 3 runs that's a fine shot and he gets three. Short, wide and forced powerfully off the back foot. Too short from Hauritz;

89.5;1;Johnson to Anderson, 1 run that was sharp - 92.9mph - but turned around the corner quite comfortably;
89.4;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run short and guided out to the off side. Opens the face nicely;
89.3;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run slower ball outside off, and he drives and misses. Fine ball from Johnson, completely doing Anderson;
89.2;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run jumps back and defends out to cover. A tense crowd applaud.;
89.1;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run short ball fended to leg. Collingwood wants a single - Anderson sends him back but Collingwood's struggling here! Here comes the throw and he misses!;
88.6;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run beautiful ball! Wonderful drift away then turns back into Collingwood who's rapped on the pads, but it hits him outside the line. The ball rebounds to Ponting at silly point who takes a blinder to his left, then appeals for the catch - charging the umpire, imploring him! Aleem Dar says no, and it's the correct decision;
88.5;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run onto the front foot and defends;
88.4;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run on leg stump, quicker ball, turned to leg;
88.3;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run slightly quicker. Collingwood's back, blocking;
88.2;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run drift for Hauritz here, and that's a lovely ball! Prodded forward meekly;

87.6;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run left alone outside off;
87.5;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run oh dear. Way, way too wide. That only just made the cut-strip;

87.3;2;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 2 runs driven behind square for two;
87.2;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run much better from Johnson! A nippy one which straightened at the last moment on Collingwood;
87.1;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run wide but full and squeezed out;
86.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run a full toss, flicked to leg but understandably they don't take the single;

86.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run edges forward nervously to defend;
86.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run squeezed out off the back foot to point;
86.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run plays and misses outside off;
86.1;W;Hilfenhaus to Swann, OUT gone! He's got him! A straight delivery on middle-and-off, too full to pull and Swann's trapped in front - kept a little low and that's plumb;Graeme Swann lbw b Hilfenhaus 31 (73m 63b 4x4 0x6) SR: 49.2;
85.6;2;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 2 runs tickled off his pads behind square - again, Johnson's lines are erratic;

85.4;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run on the front foot, defending;

85.1;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run punched off the back foot;

84.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run left alone outside off;
84.2;4;Hilfenhaus to Swann, FOUR runs cover-driven for four! Take that - a spanking shot;
84.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run short and wide and he plays and misses! Loose and poor stroke, and he throws his head back in frustration;
83.6;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run guided out to the off side;
83.5;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run that was quick! 92.1mph and he got an inside edge into his boot. Nervy times!;

82.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run fuller delivery clipped to short midwicket;

82.3;4;Hilfenhaus to Swann, FOUR runs comes forward and edges it ... through second and a wideish third slip for four!;
82.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run swings back late and raps him on the pads, but it's down the leg side. First appeal for a while;
82.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run sways out of the way;
81.6;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run better ball which almost squares Collingwood up, except he's playing so deep in his crease and so late, that it's defended solidly;
81.5;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run left alone - 90mph+ from Johnson but no swing and comfortably handled;
81.4;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run well too wide of the off stump, and he's lucky not to be wided;
81.3;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run nudged to leg;
81.2;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run again, this is a little too wide to trouble Collingwood;
81.2;1w;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 wide wide of the off stump. And wided by the umpire! Ponting not entirely happy with Johnson;
81.1;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run punched off the back foot;
80.6;1;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, 1 run that's runs, that is. A nudge to leg and he steals the strike;

78.5;?;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, no run defended off the back foot;
78.4;3;Hauritz to Swann, 3 runs that's rubbish. Short, wide and cracked off the back foot past point. They get three. Hauritz beginning to tense up here, I reckon;
78.3;?;Hauritz to Swann, no run flighted on off, he's forward and defending;

73.3;4;Siddle to Swann, FOUR runs swings in late on the right-hander who drives crisply past mid-off and this'll creep over the line for four! That's enlivened a crowd who are absolutely on the edge of their seats. Yes, England might draw, but the last-gasp hope of fighting out a draw is still keeping them (and indeed us) richly entertained;
