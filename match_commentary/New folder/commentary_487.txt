It's been Pakistan all the way so far, save for a brief period in the beginning when Warner and Clarke were hitting it around. Pakistan picked themselves up with their fielding and disciplined bowling. That double strike by Malik was the turning point. They've done all the hard work to get this far. They shouldn't mess this up.
It won't be easy because the TV commentators are saying this is the fastest MCG wicket they've seen. Join us shortly.

Teams: The lineups are updated above. Two debutants for Australia - Steve Smith the legspinning allrounder and Travis Birt, the Tasmanian left-handed batsman.
For Pakistan, Imran Nazir returns. By the way, Imran Farhat is also making his T20 debut.
Omair: "Sensible and responsible batting is all what Pakistan needs. Bowling has been decent throughout the tour at least in my opinion. I hope all departments click for the T20 World Champion today!"
With all the drama behind the scenes with Pakistan on this tour, there's enough material to write a book.
7pm: Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the one-off Twenty20 between Australia and Pakistan at the MCG.
Toss: Australia have won the toss and they will bat first. We will get the teams up shortly.
The T20 champions Pakistan sign off their tour with this game. It's their last chance to save face after what's been a rather depressing tour so far. At least, this is a format they're good at. They're without Afridi for this game so Shoaib Malik will lead. For more, read the preview by Peter English.
 Innings Start
What a game, absolutely riveting. Pakistan did so well to shoot Australia out for 127 but their batting, apart from Kamran, was abysmal against a very determined attack. Tait was quick, very quick, and his three wickets for 13 runs were incredibly crucial to Australia winning. Nannes was Nannes, Johnson came back after a horror first over, and Watson varied his pace and used those cutters to good effect. Smith, the rookie, struck two big blows on debut. Australia's fielding was sharp and Pakistan choked. Kamran's blazing fifty had them on course, despite four early wickets, but Pakistan managed to let this one go against a superb outfit. After Kamran's 64 the next best was 21 from his brother.
So Pakistan leave Australia without a single win. Another poor tour Down Under. Hope you've enjoyed our coverage of this series. Thanks for your company. That is all we have for you but remember, tomorrow is a Test match between the two best sides and in a couple days Australia will go back to playing West Indies. There is also the series in New Zealand going on. We will bring you every ball of every game live, so do come back and see us.
