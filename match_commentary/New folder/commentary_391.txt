3.25pm: That wraps up the England innings, with 54 runs coming off the last five overs. Morgan provided the spark, after the solid foundations built by Cook, Bell and Trott - exactly to plan, in other words. After a searching few overs with the new balls in helpful conditions, and having dismissed the top three without sustaining too much damage (not to mention winning the toss), Australia might feel they let things get a bit away from them ... but you never know what a par score is until both sides have batted. Alex Winter will be here in around half an hour to draw you a clearer picture.

5.3;1;McKay to Bell, 1 run moves back into Bell who works it neatly down to fine leg;
5.2;?;McKay to Bell, no run Given caught behind! Bell reviews straight away. Has this taken the inside edge? Was a superb delivery that nipped back and it appears it may have hit his trouser pocket.

Hello everyone, Australia today is it! These opponents change almost as quickly as the British weather, which now is lovely and warm with regular sunshine. Ideal conditions for the Aussies to try and chase 273 - a score that England did jolly well to get from where they were. Should be a very interesting second half...
