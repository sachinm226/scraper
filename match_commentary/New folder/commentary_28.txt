27.6;?;Shami to Smith, no run Full on the stumps, picked up off his toes to mid-on;
27.5;W;Shami to Warner, OUT huge appeal for a catch by the keeper and not given. Kohli has gone for the review. Yorker length ball, shaping away a touch, his bat hit ground as the ball went past and Rahul had an easy take. And there is a spike as the ball goes past the outside edge with the bat not yet having hit the ground I think. Yes indeed it is, so the umpire will have to change his decision and India have their first wicket.;David Warner c ?Rahul b Mohammed Shami 69 (76b 6x4 0x6) SR: 90.78;
27.4;2;Shami to Warner, 2 runs length ball tucks him up on the stumps, steered to cover. The fielder lets loose a throw and misses, no one backing up so they get a second;
27.3;4;Shami to Warner, FOUR runs slammed. That is just disdainful. Shami goes fuller and Warner stays still and just swats it over midwicket's head and into the boundary. Didn't even have a big flourish but timed it so well, he didn't need to;
27.2;1;Shami to Finch, 1 run nips back in from a length to hit him on the pads, as he's trying to swat this across, goes off the pad to point. Half an appeal from Shami;

24.1;4;Jadeja to Warner, FOUR runs reverse swept for four to fine leg. Fuller and some drift across the stumps, Warner saw the length and went down early to reverse sweep. Timed and placed perfectly;

22.4;1;Jadeja to Warner, 1 run fuller, driven to long-on;
22.3;2;Jadeja to Warner, 2 runs excellent running again and Warner has raised fifty. He's been almost quietly dominant. I know that's an oxymoron, bur Warner's pulled it off. Plays what has been his favourite shot off Jadeja to get there, the minimal flourish flat pull through square leg;
22.2;?;Jadeja to Warner, no run keeps it on a fuller length on the stumps, Warner goes back and across and taps it back to the bowler's left;
22.1;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run fuller, tapped to long-on;
21.6;?;Bumrah to Warner, no run short ball again, rising up to Warner's ribs, and he can't time the pull. Drops down near him off the bottom edge;
21.5;4lb;Bumrah to Warner, 4 leg byes unlucky for the bowler. Warner was backing away a long way, Bumrah followed him and did so excellently too, but the yorker length ball flicks his pad and goes very fine for four leg-byes;
21.5;1nb;Bumrah to Warner, (no ball) and Bumrah lets Warner know that he's not here just to make up numbers. Excellent bouncer, outside off, Warner sways out of the way;
21.4;1;Bumrah to Finch, 1 run yorker outside off, uses wrists to dig this out to midwicket. A bit of a fumble as two fielders converge so they take a quick single;

20.4;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run length ball on the stumps, patted to long-on. Jadeja wanted to go across and field but ran into Warner at the non-striker's end. No damage done;

20.2;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run goes forward and whips this across his pads through square;
20.1;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run down the track, but Jadeja had shortened his length and the ball hits the bat high. Pops up in the air but drops near his feet;
19.6;?;Bumrah to Warner, no run almost a yorker, digs it out into the legside;
19.5;1;Bumrah to Finch, 1 run not as short that time, so doesn't bounce as much and allows Finch to stay on the back foot and swivel-pull this to deep square leg;

19.2;1;Bumrah to Warner, 1 run slower ball, strays on the pads, tucked through square;
19.1;1;Bumrah to Finch, 1 run misses the direct hit at the bowler's end. Length ball angling into him, and this was tapped to mid-on. They ran through and Jadeja was the man there, swoops in and lets loose a throw. Misses the stumps - Finch was miles out if he had hit;
18.6;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run length outside off, cuts it to Saini at short third man and excellent running between the two to get that single. Saini fumbles as he's put under pressure to fire back a throw;

18.4;1;Jadeja to Warner, 1 run flatter on leg stump, tucked to backward square leg's right;
18.3;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run this time he tosses it up wider outside off and Finch flays that through cover to raise fifty. Not always fluent but he's done his part in giving Australia a great platform;

17.3;?;Chahal to Finch, no run flatter, length ball on the stumps, some turn still, defended from the crease;
17.2;6;Chahal to Finch, SIX runs nails the slog across the line. The length was too full that time from Chahal, and Finch spotted that, took a confident stride out and whacked it across the line and over the deep midwicket fence;
17.1;?;Chahal to Finch, no run googly outside off, he can't work it away;
17.1;2w;Chahal to Warner, 2 wide flatter on leg stump, tries to go down and slog sweep, but misses it. Goes down leg so it's a wide and they take a single too;
16.6;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run given some air outside off, and he defends;
16.5;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run Rahul is celebrating, he thinks Finch edged his sweep behind. They're not going to review. tossed up a bit more down leg, Finch went to sweep.

15.3;?;Chahal to Finch, no run turn again, but Finch gets forward to defend this outside off;
15.2;2;Chahal to Finch, 2 runs just out of reach for a diving Shikhar Dhawan. Tossed up wide of off, and Finch was tempted to slash at it. Dhawan as in the ring at point, the ball was hit over him, runs back and puts in a dive - always difficult to do running back - but the ball just eludes him;
15.1;?;Chahal to Finch, no run length outside off, cuts to point;
14.6;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run tucked through square;
14.6;1w;Jadeja to Finch, 1 wide goes down legside so he'll have to rebowl that;
14.5;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run stronger appeal this time but not given. They're not going to review. This looked very close, but perhaps he was struck just outside the line of off. Good flight by Jadeja, and on a nice length, he's coming forward to defend but is beaten on the inside edge and struck on the pad flap;
14.4;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run big appeal but he's too far down the track. Skipped down, tried to whip, was beaten by the drift;

13.4;1;Chahal to Warner, 1 run down the track, and takes the googly almost on the half-volley to drive to long-off;
13.3;4;Chahal to Warner, FOUR runs bam goes Warner. Chahal wanted to keep it wide of him, but it's not wide enough, ends up being in his arc and full, free swing of the arms to the midwicket boundary;

13.1;1;Chahal to Warner, 1 run tossed up fuller, flicked off his toes to deep midwicket;

 Innings Start
11.24 pm: Right, that brings us to the end of this first ODI. Australia have taken a 1-0 lead. Can India come back - don't forget to join us for the second ODI in two days' time.
Aaron Finch: I found it reasonably hard to get my timing in the middle overs. Took a couple of chances and luckily they came off. We've barely been together as a team, half in quarantine and half training at SCG. There was no conscious effort to say we're going to go and target X,Y,Z. As partnerships grow you work it out. Each guy has different strengths and weaknesses. Davey is moving beautifully, something he's been working on. Smudge was different class altogether. And Maxi, that rare ability he's got to almost just click his fingers and put pressure back on the opposition. Super skill, some of those reverses were extraordinary.
Virat Kohli: We got enough time to prepare, I don't think there's any excuses on the field when you don't pull up as a side. Probably the first long game we've played in a while, we've been playing T20 cricket. But having said that, we've all played a lot of ODI cricket. The body language after 25-26 overs was disappointing. A quality side will hurt you (if you have fielding lapses). We'll have to find out ways of getting a few overs from a few part-timers in the side. Unfortunately Hardik is not ready to bowl yet so we have to accept that and work around it. That is an area we have looked at, which is a very big part of any team balance. Stoinis and Glenn (Maxwell) do it for Australia. The key to keeping the batsmen in check is picking up wickets and we couldn't do that. From the batting point of view, we had a chat briefly after the game - all of us committed to playing positively and that's why you saw everyone go out there and play with intent. We just need to have a big innings from the top three, 130 or 140, which didn't happen unfortunately. Hardik's innings was an example of that (intent). At no stage did we think we might not get there. We committed to playing positive cricket and we are going to do that going forward as well. When teams put up large totals, you have to have a plan. (On him bowling a few overs) [laughs] Maybe I'll bowl a few when Finchy is batting because I know he doesn't want to get out to me.
Steven Smith is the Man of the Match: I've been searching for something for a couple of months now, unfortunately haven't been able to find it. But a couple of days ago I started to hit the ball where I wanted it, and everything came back, the rhythm came back. Finchy and Davey set an excellent platform, we could come and just take off. I wasn't thinking too much out there, just seeing the ball and hitting it. That's probably when I bat my best. I took a few more risks than I would normally, targeted some bowlers and fortunately it came off today. I thought it was a bit high (on the lbw referral) and fortunately it was. You need a bit of luck sometimes, nice to ride it today and score a few for the team.
11.12 pm: How good was Australia's batting though? Aaron Finch shrugged off periods of unfluency to raise another century. David Warner was quietly efficient, Glenn Maxwell put behind a poor IPL to unleash a typically Maxwell innings. And Steven Smith, with newly rediscovered hands, was amazing.
11.09 pm: A 66-run win for Australia, which speaks about the gulf between the sides today. Australia's batsmen, led by Steven Smith, were a cut above what India could muster. The Indians did challenge the total for parts of the innings, but the enormity of the target meant everytime a wicket fell, the pressure ratcheted up. Especially with India's long tail. Hardik Pandya played a fine hand, and Shikhar Dhawan did his bit at the top of the order too. Starc had a very rusty day but Hazlewood and Zampa ensured there would be no miracle win for India.
49.6;?;Starc to Bumrah, no run yorker goes through him, misses off stump though, and it's a big win for Australia;
49.5;?;Starc to Bumrah, no run back of a length outside off, Bumrah was probably expecting a yorker, and he's late on that, goes past his bat;
49.4;?;Starc to Bumrah, no run yorker outside off, Bumrah keeps it out, getting right behind it and patting to cover;
49.3;W;Starc to Shami, OUT the Starc yorker on show finally. Too good for Shami, blockhole and off stump knocked back. Not been a happy day for Starc, but he at least has one trademark wicket now;Mohammed Shami b Starc 13 (10b 1x4 1x6) SR: 130;
49.2;1;Starc to Saini, 1 run steps away to carve this length ball through point. There's a man in the deep to field;

48.5;?;Hazlewood to Saini, no run low full toss, yorker gone wrong, he heaves it to mid-on;
48.4;2;Hazlewood to Saini, 2 runs back of a length outside off, steps away and throws his bat at it. The sliced shot lobs up, but doesn't carry to third man;
48.3;?;Hazlewood to Saini, no run full on the stumps, clipped to mid-on;
48.2;2;Hazlewood to Saini, 2 runs width outside off and he crashes this full ball through cover;

48.1;2;Hazlewood to Saini, 2 runs goes for the yorker on middle stump, doesn't quite get it, the batsman clears front leg and swipes across the line to deep midwicket;
47.6;?;Starc to Shami, no run beaten outside off, length ball and he is feeling for it;
47.5;1;Starc to Saini, 1 run fuller outside off, thick outside edge goes to third man;
47.4;?;Starc to Saini, no run full outside off, giving himself room to slash it on the offside but can't connect;
47.3;?;Starc to Saini, no run yorker outside off, driven confidently to mid-off. Not timed that well though;
47.2;?;Starc to Saini, no run they've gone for a review for caught behind. I think it flicked the pad. length ball goes down leg and Carey collects and belts out an appeal. Starc follows but not as confidently. Finch has gone for the review though Starc seemed to shrug as if to say 'I'm not sure'. Nothing on HotSpot and no spike on Ultra edge either. So it'll stay not out.;
47.1;1;Starc to Shami, 1 run full on off from around the wicket, driven on the up to deep point;
46.6;4;Maxwell to Saini, FOUR runs flatter and quicker, tried to flat bat it towards midwicket but it takes the top edge and runs very fine - no fielder to stop that one;
46.5;1;Maxwell to Shami, 1 run full toss, going for another heave-ho of a hit, but it squirts off the leading edge towards cover;
46.4;4;Maxwell to Shami, FOUR runs down the track again and he absolutely leathers this, flatter than the last one but more powerful too, bisects long-on and deep midwicket;

45.5;?;Zampa to Shami, no run googly first up, and Shami goes deep in his crease and defends it;
45.4;W;Zampa to Jadeja, OUT this time he picks out wide long-on. Down the track again, didn't get the elevation he had last time, and hits it flatter. Starc moves smartly to his left and pouches the ball, making the catch look easier than it was;Ravindra Jadeja c Starc b Zampa 25 (37b 0x4 1x6) SR: 67.56;
45.3;1;Zampa to Saini, 1 run length ball, spinning away from off, he carves it to deep point;
45.2;1;Zampa to Jadeja, 1 run sliding across him on a length, cuts it to deep point;
45.1;6;Zampa to Jadeja, SIX runs down the track and over the top. Tossed up and he came down and hit this very straight, over long-on;
44.6;?;Maxwell to Saini, no run has another big swing, but this time can't connect. Length ball going across him, he was clearing his leg and looking for cow corner;
44.5;6;Maxwell to Saini, SIX runs nails it over the bowler's head. Went down on one knee and slog-swept this straight back. Tossed up and in the slot, and he got hold of it nicely;
44.4;2;Maxwell to Saini, 2 runs quicker one outside off, he slashes at it, gets a thick outside edge that short third man can't quite get his hands to;

43.4;1;Zampa to Saini, 1 run goes right back and whips this to long-on;
43.3;2;Zampa to Saini, 2 runs tossed up wide of off, he goes down on one knee and lofts it over cover. Not timed well so doesn't carry to the fielders in the deep;

38.6;?;Zampa to Saini, no run tossed up outside off, driven to cover;
38.5;W;Zampa to Hardik, OUT caught at long-on. He had to go for it, with the dot balls piling up and the run-rate climbing. This wasn't tossed up, it was flatter in fact, which meant Hardik couldn't get underneath it properly. Still went for it, and lofted it almost cleanly, but not enough to carry over long-on. Goes for his highest ODI score;Hardik Pandya c Starc b Zampa 90 (76b 7x4 4x6) SR: 118.42;
38.4;1;Zampa to Jadeja, 1 run slightly wider that time, pitches on off and Jadeja manages to punch it away to point;

8.2;6;Cummins to Kohli, SIX runs imperious. That is just a fabulous shot. Goes across slightly and the length ball ends up on his thigh pad, he plays a pick-up shot that is timed so well it soars over the square leg boundary.;

7.6;?;Hazlewood to Kohli, no run fuller outside off, driven to mid-off on the front foot;

6.4;?;Cummins to Kohli, no run length on the stumps, defended;
6.3;2;Cummins to Kohli, 2 runs top edge dropped at fine leg. Adam Zampa has dropped his RCB captain, that could prove very costly. Good ball by Cummins, bangs it in short and it gets big on Kohli, who goes for the pull. Top edge flies straight to Zampa, into his hands and through them.;
6.2;?;Cummins to Kohli, no run a bit too straight and Kohli clips him off his pads, but straight to midwicket;

5.2;W;Hazlewood to Agarwal, OUT caught at point. The bowler out-thinks the batsman in that one.

Agarwal ended up not in the best position and his slash went off the top edge to loop to point, who had to take a couple of steps back for a comfortable catch;Mayank Agarwal c Maxwell b Hazlewood 22 (18b 2x4 1x6) SR: 122.22;

3.6;?;Hazlewood to Agarwal, no run fuller on middle and leg, clipped to mid-on;
3.5;6;Hazlewood to Agarwal, SIX runs stunning. That is some shot by Agarwal. Gave himself some room, cleared his front leg and played an inside out cover drive that has sailed over the boundary.

3.4;?;Hazlewood to Agarwal, no run good length on off, punched to cover;
3.3;1;Hazlewood to S Dhawan, 1 run good tight bowling by Hazlewood here, keeping it on a good length and a tight line. Dhawan taps it softly towards point for a quick run;

2.1;4;Starc to S Dhawan, FOUR runs lovely shot. Starc bowls it on a fuller length, but it's not a length that should be driven so easily. Dhawan's in great form too though and he comes on the front foot to stroke this through cover;
1.6;2;Hazlewood to Agarwal, 2 runs well timed again, full outside off and stroked through cover. The fielder got a hand to it sliding, so that slowed it up enough for the ball to be pulled in before it hits the boundary;
1.5;?;Hazlewood to Agarwal, no run fuller on off, jabs his bat down in time to defend towards point;
1.4;4;Hazlewood to Agarwal, FOUR runs thick outside edge goes for four. Hazlewood bowls it back of a length and moving away, Agarwal follows it with his hands, aware that there is only one slip and the angle means it'll be well clear of the man. Gets a boundary;

0.5;5nb;Starc to S Dhawan, (no ball) FOUR runs nicely done. Too full on the pads and Dhawan flicks it with superb timing, well clear of the square leg fielder though it was in the air. Uh-oh, Starc's nightmare over has gotten worse. He's overstepped, so free hit coming up. Marginally over the line;
0.4;1;Starc to Agarwal, 1 run the change of angle works, and he slants a length ball into him, the batsman steers it through point off the back foot;
0.4;1w;Starc to Agarwal, 1 wide still not getting his radar right, goes back the other way, outside the right-hander's off, but it's too wide outside off;
0.4;5w;Starc to Agarwal, 5 wide oh that's gone waaaay down leg. Completely lost control of that Starc, might have been a wide to a left-hander outside off too, it was that far down leg. No chance for Carey, five wides to India;

Mitchell Starc, ODI bowler supreme, has the ball. He's among the rare top international cricketers who was not at the IPL. He'll be bowling to Agarwal. One slip
7.16 pm: It's going to be Rohit Sharma Mayank Agarwal and Shikhar Dhawan to open for India. I'm looking forward to this opening pair. In my view, they were both clearly the best Indian openers in IPL 2020. Agarwal deserves his shot here. The whodunnit about Rohit's injury shouldn't overshadow that. And, as Sidharth Monga so pertinently observes, "It is perhaps time to wake up to the high regard the players, and indeed the fans, hold the IPL in. It is the most-watched tournament in the world, bigger than any Test series and even the World Cup." Read the piece already if you haven't yet.
7.09 pm: Gnasher tells me India's chase will start in 10 minutes. Enough time to dip into how Steven Smith almost predicted an incoming masterclass from him with these prophetic words: "I think the last few days actually I've found something. People close to me that know me well, I've found my hands the last few days, which I'm extremely excited about."
