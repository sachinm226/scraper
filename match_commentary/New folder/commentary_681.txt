 Innings Start
A comprehensive victory for Australia. They win by 229 runs. The cricketing world, meanwhile, has been engulfed by the tragic news of Bob Woolmer's death. Do click here to read some early tributes. I shall leave you with the one from Allan Donald.
""The news was pretty devastating, to be honest. He was a very, very close friend, actually more than as a coach.... He was a very respected man. We were together with Warwickshire and South Africa. Bob was an extremely professional man, was an extremely soft person, gave his life to cricket and probably paid for it."
This is Sriram Veera, signing off.
