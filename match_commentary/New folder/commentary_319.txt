Data
So Australia end the innings at a commanding 305 for 5. Phillip Hughes managed a century on debut, the first Australian to do so. George Bailey managed 89 and it bodes well for Australia that their second string managed a massive score, without Warner, Clarke, Hussey.

Finch takes guard. Two debutants.
Apples: "To me, watching debutants is just as exciting if not more so than seeing the exact same team rolled out for yet another year. At least Finch, Khawaja, Hughes and Cutting have all earned their spots with some decent performances."
Lots of talk about this Australian team being a B team. George Bailey, the Australia captain, doesn't like to think so.
Omar: "It'll be good to see Khawaja in a big event after a long absence from International Cricket. Looking forward to see him cracking some shots after his recent Big Bash form...."
Mark: "With all this criticism towards the Australia, I actually do like this team. Finally giving domestic players that are performing a chance. Finch especially."
On paper, Sri Lanka are more experienced. And they have been performing well in Australia over the last three years. They have stopped by quite often have they? I wonder if they've bought houses already.
There's plenty to play for for the likes of Sri Lanka's younger players. Dananjaya isn't playing today, but this will be a good learning curve for someone like Jeevan Mendis. Brydon writes.
Irfan ahmad: "What a day. Aus-SL first, India-Eng second and then SA- NZ. Such days are so rare.. I had to take a leave from office... I did...."
Toss: Australia have won the toss and they will bat first.
This means that Kulasekara is fit. No place for Eranga today. Ajantha Mendis makes a return to one-day cricket after exactly a year.

1.45pm: Good morning/afternoon everyone and welcome to the coverage of the first ODI between Australia and Sri Lanka at the MCG. The toss is on shortly.
Joney: "joney: "to late for good morning," You're forgetting that it's morning for our readers in Sri Lanka.
 Innings Start
End of match: Comprehensive win for Australia. Outsmarted Sri Lanka in all departments, with a special mention for the fielding. Three run-outs, all specialist batsmen. Chandimal was the positive today for Sri Lanka, but had it not been for those run outs, this could have gotten closer. That's something SL need to address before their next match. Today was a communications disaster.
Richard : "Sorry. What was that about an Aussie B-side?"
It can't be too bad a team when you have the likes of Hughes, Khawaja and Finch in probably the form of his life. He didn't perform today but his time will come.
Phillip Hughes is the Man of the Match. We don't have coverage of the presentation.
Otherwise that's it from here. There's still the India-England ODI and the SA v NZ Test to keep you occupied. We're back for the second ODI at Adelaide in two days. Same time. Thanks for your company. Cheers!
