 Innings Start
So Australia win by 60 runs and extend their unbeaten streak in World cup matches to 33. But Kenya played proudly, they were good with the ball too, spirited performance and didn't let Australia get away easily. And their batsmen did not fold like they did in previous matches, Collins Obuya leading the resistance with an unbeaten 98.
Jimmy Kamande: "At the end of the we came out second, so it's a little disappointing. The worst thing is we have only one more game left. But we can hope to improve from today. All in all Tanmay, Collins and some bowling from Nehimiah was excellent ..."
Ricky Ponting: "A bit of rust on the team, even with the batting. Full credit to Kenya, they fought really well. We tried a few different things today, bowling Smith in the Powerplay ... but hopefully we've shaken off the rust ahead of the Canada game ... great to have Hussey back. We'll have a rest day tomorrow, we've done plenty of training ..."
The Man of the Match is Collins Obuya! Well done Collins, against Australia, in a World Cup. "I'm very proud," he says. "I've been working hard on my batting, on my bowling as well, hopefully I'll become a batting allrounder." He's gracious as well about not getting enough strike at the death and missing his hundred.
A parting comment and it's from Mark Kidger: "Kenya will take some heart from that performance. For Australia, job done, but they won't have terrified any of the sides in the other group today thinking about the Quarter Final crosses."
That's about it from us at ESPNcricinfo for today. Thank you for all your emails and comments. We get a lot and we try to read and publish as many as we can between deliveries. Join us tomorrow for another double header. Cheers, and goodnight.
