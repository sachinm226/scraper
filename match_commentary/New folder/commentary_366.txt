If you choose to bat first and get bowled out for less than 200, it's a fail mark. Terrific stuff from Australia. They created the chances, this was no fluke.
Let's not write India's obituary yet. India's bowlers will also be a threat if they pitch it up like the Australians did. We also saw at the MCG that Australia's batting is vulnerable. Nevertheless, they've put themselves in a very good position by getting India bowled for just 191.
Rajesh tweets: "India's overseas 1st inngs average per wicket in the last year is the lowest of all teams: 27.29. At home they've averaged 48.96."
The last time India were bowled out for less than 200 in consecutive innings was at the MCG in 2007.

Here's Peter Siddle
 Innings Start
It was supposed to be the drinks break but Clarke decided that 329 is more than enough for him, 150 for Hussey and a massive lead of 468. A selfless decision by Clarke, considering that he was 71 away from the world record score (Lara) and 51 away from an Australian Test record (Hayden). He must be quite knackered himself.
Clarke and gang took advantage of a deflated Indian outfit who were probably waiting for the declaration for an eternity now. India have close to two and a half days to bat out.
Tweet from Rajneesh Gupta: "First time in Test history that a side has posted two 250+ partnerships in the same innings."
Sanju: "Ashwin falls just 5 runs short of beating Agarkar's "record" of 161 runs without a wicket in Australia."
Qasim: "Looks like Clarke paid tribute to big man Inzi by not surpassing his 329."

 Innings Start
4.30pm: The presentation is being delayed for some reason. We can confirm that Clarke is the Man of the Match. (No kidding, Sherlock!)
Dhoni: "We were down in the first session on the first day. A few batsman got out to good deliveries. It was very difficult to contain Clarke. We can beat this team in Perth." Dhoni keeps it very simple.
Clarke: "It was a tough wicket to take 10 wickets but our bowlers were brilliant. I've spoken about consistency and our guys are doing that now. In any team you need experience and youth and I think now this Australian team has it. I was as relieved as Punt (Ponting). His attitude around the group has been exceptional. It (Sachin's wicket) is a
very handy one to have."

That's just about it from here. Thanks for all the mails. Lot of emotions and mock obituaries in some of those! There's a week to recover for the WACA. For the benefit of Indian readers, the toss is at 8am. More manageable times. Cheers guys!

Jarrod Kimber (the better half or other half of the Two Chucks, however you call it), tweets: "This series is already looking like an American remake of a cooler European film I saw 6 months ago."
Sidvee tweets: "Just imagine if India had won 4-0 in England and were up 2-0 in Aus. You would have read reams and reams about the Fletcher effect."
Australia record one of their most comprehensive wins of late. They stumbled at Hobart after a thumping win, but this time they went one step higher. Exposes India's weaknesses even more, and that's a discussion for another day, and that will take the entire day.
Clarke, Hussey and Ponting all had statements to make, and they picked a historic venue to deliver them. Australian cricket can smile after a ego-crushing summer last year when they were thrashed by England.
Three years back, India were in a similar situation, going 0-2 down at the SCG before hitting back at Perth. They weren't meant to lose that second Test but this time, they deserved what they got. Which makes the recovery all the more difficult. There's another week left for that. Lots of time for introspection/team changes.
Jyotishman Sharma: "No matter what is happening, i will remain a die- hard Indian cricket fan. But my team is not doing no good my giving me sleepless nights. But i still hope! I know the good days are not far away."
For Australia, one certain change is Harris in for Lyon. The other question mark revolves around Marsh. Lifeline for Khawaja perhaps. Not sure if the knives are out yet for Haddin.
