Australia have managed to get their total up to 268, which is well below par but given their horrid start, isn't too bad a finish. And if their fast bowlers can get a few early wickets, who knows what could happen. But good luck getting Cook cheaply.
"Swann strikes in the first over of his spell. Order restored in every sense," notes Andrew Miller.
75.6;W;Swann to Hilfenhaus, OUT ah, there's the last wicket as Hilfenhaus gets an inside edge onto the thigh and it's taken by Cook at short leg;Ben Hilfenhaus c Cook b Swann 13 (25m 12b 3x4 0x6) SR: 108.33;
75.5;?;Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run turning down leg, it's clipped to short midwicket;
75.4;1;Swann to Siddle, 1 run edgy, but safely through point for a single;
75.3;?;Swann to Siddle, no run watches this one off the pitch as it spins in to him, and he pushes to off;
75.2;?;Swann to Siddle, no run tossed up outside off, again Siddle is more careful against the spinner and just defends;
75.1;?;Swann to Siddle, no run leans forward to defend, watchfully;
74.6;1;Finn to Siddle, 1 run cleverly done by Siddle, he's pushed back onto the back foot by a short-of-a-length ball and prods it in the air to off, but then takes off for a run as he realises the fielders are a little deep;
74.5;2;Finn to Siddle, 2 runs Siddle backs away now and somehow gets that off the toe of the bat through mid-off, not exactly where he wanted it to go, but gets a couple;
74.4;?;Finn to Siddle, no run bouncer! Siddle tries for the hook, though not really watching the ball, and it goes through to Prior, who doesn't take it cleanly;
74.3;4;Finn to Siddle, FOUR runs another boundary! This one is, er, I think the best way to describe that is a slap. Short ball, and he's pulled it, of sorts, but forward of midwicket, not exactly in control but effective!;
74.2;?;Finn to Siddle, no run nudged away to the leg side;
74.1;4;Finn to Siddle, FOUR runs another boundary! This time it's Siddle launching that one back down the ground, a really good uppish drive through the mid-off area;
73.6;?;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run yorker, and Hilfenhaus defends - almost wanting a single so he can keep the strike!;
73.5;4;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs and with short leg in, the bouncer was on, so Hilfenhaus winds up and throws the kitchen sink at that hook, finding the gap at deep square leg! Entertaining stuff!;
73.4;4;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs thumped! That's what Hilfenhaus has developed - the ability to hit good bowlers for four! He's flat batted that over mid off, nicely done indeed;
73.3;?;Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, no run good ball, banged in short of a length on off stump but Hilfenhaus waves the bat inside it;
73.2;1;Tremlett to Siddle, 1 run bouncer and this time Siddle doesn't duck, he hooks and gets a single to deep backward square;
73.1;4;Tremlett to Siddle, FOUR runs edged and that just gets up high enough to fly over the head of Swann, jumping up at second slip - that ball really lifted sharply off the pitch;
72.6;?;Finn to Hilfenhaus, no run angled bat from Hilfenhaus, and it's collected at gully;
72.5;1;Finn to Siddle, 1 run clipped away off the hips for a run to fine leg;
72.4;1;Finn to Hilfenhaus, 1 run edged and is that a dropped chance? No, it's bounced just short of Swann at second slip, and in knocking it down he allows Hilfenhaus to get a single;
72.3;4;Finn to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs Hilfenhaus goes for the cut and it comes off beautifully! Right through the gap between point and gully;
72.2;1;Finn to Siddle, 1 run good drive from Siddle, and he's unlucky to just get the single there as it's well fielded at short cover, knocked down by Trott;
72.1;?;Finn to Siddle, no run another very good bouncer, and another good piece of ducking from Siddle, getting safely out of the way;
71.6;1;Tremlett to Siddle, 1 run Siddle dabs to cover and takes off for a single, so he'll keep the strike;
71.5;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run good bouncer, well directed, but Siddle is good enough to duck it;
71.4;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run this one really nips in off the seam, striking Siddle on the pad and would have gone down leg;
71.3;2;Tremlett to Siddle, 2 runs trying to york Siddle now, but he flicks it nicely through square leg and it's good, hard running to get back for two;
71.2;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run angled in to Siddle, who clips it to leg;
71.1;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run pushed away to point;
70.6;?;Finn to Hilfenhaus, no run good bounce and carry, Hilfenhaus leaves it;
70.5;?;Finn to Hilfenhaus, no run good line, tempting Hilfenhaus just outside off and he dabs, not connecting bat on ball;
70.4;?;Finn to Hilfenhaus, no run wide of off, Hilfenhaus leaves it;
70.3;W;Finn to Johnson, OUT gone! Finn gets the breakthrough with another shortish one tempting Johnson to pull, but his shot flies straight to Anderson at square leg, where he takes a simple catch.;Mitchell Johnson c Anderson b Finn 62 (117m 93b 8x4 1x6) SR: 66.66;
70.2;?;Finn to Johnson, no run good bowling! Johnson backs away again, and Finn follows him - this is like one-day cricket - allowing Johnson no room and his pull rolls back to the bowler;
70.1;4;Finn to Johnson, FOUR runs that's the WACA for you, Johnson backs away and goes for the pull, the top edge flies over Prior's head and bounces over the boundary, England are lucky that didn't sail away for six;
69.6;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run solidly defended back down the pitch;
69.5;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run huge appeal for lbw, turned down by Marais Erasmus and Strauss wants a review! After all three Hot Spot angles, it shows there was no inside edge there, which was one of the main questions. Aha, but Virtual Eye or Eagle Eye or whatever Channel Nine use, says umpire's call for clipping the top of leg stump, so Siddle is safe;
69.4;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run chopped back onto the pad now, lucky that didn't Rick O'Shea onto the stumps;
69.3;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run bouncer, Siddle ducks underneath it and that sails through to the bearded, begloved man behind the stumps, Matthew Prior;
69.2;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run probing outside off stump, and it's comfortably defended by Siddle;
69.1;1;Tremlett to Johnson, 1 run again Johnson goes for the pull, again it's collected at deep midwicket, and again England will be happy to get Siddle on strike;
68.6;?;Finn to Siddle, no run prodded away to point again, where Anderson is doing some stretching - not as the ball comes, of course - he seems to have a touch of cramp;
68.5;?;Finn to Siddle, no run a flashy slash outside off from Siddle, this one's stopped by the man at point - Anderson, that is;
68.4;?;Finn to Siddle, no run good yorker, and it's straight, but Siddle is up to the task and keeps it out;
68.3;1;Finn to Johnson, 1 run he's Mr Whippy with those pulls is Johnson, whipping the bat around the corner to turn the ball through square leg;
68.2;1;Finn to Siddle, 1 run ooh, shouts of catch it as Siddle drives uppishly and Trott at short cover can only knock it down on the bounce, allowing a quickly scampered single;
68.1;1;Finn to Johnson, 1 run on the pads from Finn, who sees a single worked through square leg by Johnson;
67.6;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run there was an attempted yorker, but it's overcooked and Siddle past the full toss back to the bowler.;
67.5;2;Tremlett to Siddle, 2 runs banged in short, a yorker would have been a better option, Siddle swings away a pull shot quiet effectively and Trott has to skirt around from fine leg to pick up and throw;
67.4;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run Siddle is really hanging back which means even good length balls can be defended off the back foot;
67.3;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run if anything Tremlett could probably be a touch fuller, he again has Siddle in trouble as this crashes into the thigh;
67.2;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run good delivery here, some extra bounce from a length and Siddle gets into an awkward position to defend;
67.1;1;Tremlett to Johnson, 1 run Tremlett starts with a short ball to Johnson who pulls crisply along the carpet to deep square for one;
66.6;?;Swann to Siddle, no run resolute defence to finish the over;
66.5;2;Swann to Siddle, 2 runs neatly played, a touch edgy possibly, but Siddle is deep in his crease flashing a cut wide of slip for a couple;
66.4;?;Swann to Siddle, no run Siddle aims a big swipe, doesn't really time it but it heads wide, some poor running means an easy single is rejected;
66.3;?;Swann to Siddle, no run Siddle stretches into another careful defence;
66.2;1;Swann to Johnson, 1 run Johnson looking at ease here, flicking a single to midwicket;
66.1;1;Swann to Siddle, 1 run Siddle firmly pushes a forward block that runs square off the face for a single;
65.6;1;Tremlett to Siddle, 1 run Siddle pushes a single down the ground to finish an excellent comeback over from Tremlett;
65.5;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run given all the bounce we've seen today this is unexpected, genuine edge found and it goes low to second slip, landing just short;
65.4;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run oooh, this pitched back of a length outside off and climbed past Siddle's outside edge, Prior took it above his head;
65.3;1;Tremlett to Johnson, 1 run good shot for a single that, Johnson whipping a shot-arm pull to deep midwicket;
65.2;?;Tremlett to Johnson, no run beaten! The bouncer is followed by a length ball that Johnson fences at outside off, finding nothing but fresh air;

64.2;?;Swann to Johnson, no run plenty of flight again and Johnson watches carefully before defending;
64.1;?;Swann to Johnson, no run nicely bowled, tossed up and Johnson advances down the track ominously, only to defend;
63.6;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run a touch short, a touch wide but the mistimed cut finds point;
63.5;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run again the extra bounce brings a false shot, Siddle trying to flick to leg but it thuds into the thigh pad;
63.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run Siddle fighting hard after his first-ball waft and defends tidily here;
63.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run splicing-jarring length is defended;
63.2;2;Anderson to Siddle, 2 runs this is worked to square leg for a couple;
63.1;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run flash and a miss outside off, Siddle doing away with foot movement;
62.6;?;Swann to Johnson, no run careful defence to finish the over;

62.4;?;Swann to Johnson, no run quietly defended again;
62.3;?;Swann to Johnson, no run horrid delivery, dragged short but Johnson's cut shot picks out the one fielder saving a single in the off side;
62.2;3;Swann to Siddle, 3 runs if the leave was good this was even better, Siddle spotting the shorter length and getting back and across in a flash to cut for three to bring Johnson back on strike;
62.1;?;Swann to Siddle, no run Swann throws one up well outside off and Siddle leaves alone with elan, really expansive shouldering of arms there;
61.6;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run Johnson on 49... and stays on 49 as he quietly defends Anderson towards midwicket;
61.5;1;Anderson to Siddle, 1 run Anderson aims another yorker, lands it well but Siddle clamps down on it in time and earns a single as a reward;
61.4;1;Anderson to Johnson, 1 run carefully worked away for a single to leave Siddle with two to face;
61.3;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run back of a length, Johnson looks to work to leg but picks out a fielder;
61.2;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run beaten outside off stump, full and past the outside edge. No word from either man, perhaps they've said all they need to;
61.1;4;Anderson to Johnson, FOUR runs four runs will please the batsman, but the delivery will please the bowler, sharp and seamed away, took an edge and flew wide of the slips;
60.6;?;Swann to Siddle, no run more studious defence from Siddle to set up a Anderson v Johnson slanging match;
60.5;?;Swann to Siddle, no run once again Swann is happy with his attacking, outside-off line and Siddle stretches across to defend;
60.4;?;Swann to Siddle, no run Siddle stretches forward to defend under his eyes;

60.1;?;Swann to Johnson, no run Swann and Johnson continue their intriguing battle with Johnson content to defend at this stage;
59.6;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run Anderson finishes another wicket-taking over by again hugging off stump and forcing Siddle to defend uneasily;
59.5;W;Anderson to Harris, OUT and another one goes, Harris's brief foray into runscoring ends with an excellent yorker, squeezes under the bat and knocks back off stump. Anderson celebrates in Johnson's direction, telling him to "shhh";Ryan Harris b Anderson 3 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60;
59.4;1;Anderson to Johnson, 1 run field pushed back so Johnson's airy push down the ground is entirely safe;
59.3;3;Anderson to Harris, 3 runs Harris has runs! Gets off the mark with a lower-order surprising drive through point for three;
59.2;1;Anderson to Johnson, 1 run worked into the leg side again, this time just for one;
59.1;4;Anderson to Johnson, FOUR runs that's a ludicrously good shot, nothing more than back of a length from Anderson outside off stump, Johnson whipped it wide of mid-on for four. He looks in very good order, hopefully it will transfer to his bowling;
58.6;1;Swann to Johnson, 1 run lovely finish to the over, Swann hanging it outside off begging for Johnson to have a mow, but instead he pats to point for a sharp single;
58.5;?;Swann to Johnson, no run better delivery here, slower and more inviting, but still Johnson resists;

57.5;?;Anderson to Harris, no run this is well outside off and gleefully left alone;
57.4;?;Anderson to Harris, no run ooh, he survives, but only just. Good testing delivery, up and around off, angling in, took the inside edge and thudded into pad;
57.3;W;Anderson to Haddin, OUT Anderson strikes but it looks a horrid shot. If it came off we'd be cheering but as it is, this is a gift. Well outside off stump at a drive-me length, Haddin threw his arms at it, leaning back, head up, and off the edge it went high to Swann at second slip clasped onto a very sharp catch, jumping high above his head and tumbling back as he held on;Brad Haddin c Swann b Anderson 53 (119m 80b 6x4 1x6) SR: 66.25;
57.2;1;Anderson to Johnson, 1 run flicked off the pads for a single;
57.1;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run good length from Anderson, full enough to be hitting the top of off, Johnson is untroubled through and unhurried against this older ball;
56.6;?;Swann to Haddin, no run good line outside off stump, Haddin eases into languid defence;
56.5;1;Swann to Johnson, 1 run ooh, Swann tossed it up again and Johnson couldn't resist an almighty thwack, didn't time it well enough and it went one bounce to deep midwicket;
56.4;?;Swann to Johnson, no run touch of air from Swann and Johnson runs down the wicket only to pad it away, good battle this;
56.3;?;Swann to Johnson, no run Johnson uses the extra bounce to stand tall and defend;
56.2;?;Swann to Johnson, no run this is a touch slower but again tight on middle and leg, Swann reluctant to give him room to swing his arms, Johnson pats a defence;
56.1;?;Swann to Johnson, no run The Swann v Johnson battle continues with Swann firing this flat and down the leg side;
55.6;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin bats like a man with time on his side, easing into line to defend;
55.5;1;Anderson to Johnson, 1 run nicely played here, Johnson gets back and flicks wide of midwicket for a single to bring up the 50 stand;
55.4;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run touch of extra bounce, as we've seen all day, gets Johnson into a spot of bother, squared up in defence;
55.3;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run much better from Anderson here, locating a length, a line and the middle of Johnson's defensive bat;
55.2;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run shoved a long way down the leg side, sort of delivery the batsman must be familiar with;
55.1;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run Anderson starts with one slightly outside off that Haddin steers, with bat and pad far apart, safely for a single behind square;
54.6;?;Swann to Johnson, no run carefully defended to finish;
54.5;6;Swann to Johnson, SIX runs bosh! Simple, clean blow down the ground. Johnson thrust a foot out, swung his big arms through the line and sent it perfectly straight down the ground, there was a long-on in place but Johnson didn't mind;
54.4;?;Swann to Johnson, no run touch more air here but Johnson content to get his eye back in after tea;
54.3;?;Swann to Johnson, no run touch shorter this time and Johnson is back to defend;
54.2;?;Swann to Johnson, no run big backlift suggested an expansive hoik, but with the field set deep he opts to defend instead;
54.1;?;Swann to Johnson, no run Tosses one up outside off, Johnson calmly defends;
53.6;?;PD Collingwood to Haddin, no run good length and holds its line, Haddin lets it go and that's tea;
53.5;1lb;PD Collingwood to Johnson, 1 leg bye tries to tuck it square, off the pads for a single;
53.4;?;PD Collingwood to Johnson, no run oooh, did he misread that one? Nipped back in and he shouldered arms, didn't pick that, good length just outside off and came back in, could have knocked off the off stump but goes over instead;
53.3;?;PD Collingwood to Johnson, no run not this time, pitched up and he attacks it with a flowing drive but straight to extra cover who palms it off to mid-off;
53.2;?;PD Collingwood to Johnson, no run a tempting length outside off but Johnson restrains himself, leaving it be;
53.1;1;PD Collingwood to Haddin, 1 run a thick inside edge for Haddin, held its line and it appeared he was expecting it to nip away slightly, past square leg for a single;

52.1;?;Swann to Johnson, no run pitched up on the off, driven straight to mid-off;
51.6;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run short of a good length again, punched off the back foot to cover;
51.5;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run short of a good length again but holds its line, trusting the bounce and so he should at the WACA, rocks back and dabs it to point;
51.4;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run beaten, lovely stuff from the tall Tremlett, short of a good length this time and nipped away to just evade the outside edge, Haddin was drawn forward but was almost done in by the movement;
51.3;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run strikes that on the up though not off the meat, bowled it on a good length and he pushed it through the line to mid-off;
51.2;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run short of a good length on middle, Haddin rocks back and jabs it wide of midwicket;

46.2;?;Swann to Johnson, no run defended back down the pitch;

44.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run sharp turn there from Swann, onto the pads of Haddin, the ball lobs up to the vacant leg slip area;
44.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run turning in to Haddin, who defends;

41.4;?;Finn to Haddin, no run just to confirm that Haddin is in limited-overs mode, he backs away and advances down the pitch, trying to cut over point but this one bounces over his bat and safely through to Prior;
41.3;?;Finn to Haddin, no run solidly defended to the off side;
41.2;4;Finn to Haddin, FOUR runs that's a terrific piece of batting from Haddin, almost in one-day mode as he waits on a short ball at chest height, then just guides it over the slips, fully intending to land that ball down at the vacant third man area. Well played.;

40.5;1;Swann to Johnson, 1 run Johnson gets off the mark by squeezing it away wide of short leg;
40.4;W;Swann to Hussey, OUT Swann strikes! What a breakthrough as Hussey gets a thin edge behind and Prior takes the catch. Initially the umpire gives it not out, but Prior races down the pitch to Swann and signals for the review himself - Strauss then officially asks for the review, Hot Spot shows a clear edge there, and Hussey is gone!;Michael Hussey c ?Prior b Swann 61 (139m 104b 9x4 1x6) SR: 58.65;
40.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run solidly defended this time as Hussey leans forward;
40.2;2;Swann to Hussey, 2 runs oh, lucky from Hussey there, he's chopped the ball down into the ground and between the legs of Prior - could easily have gone back onto his stumps;
40.1;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run driven down the ground to the man at long-on, easy single there;
39.6;4;Finn to Hussey, FOUR runs another short ball, not clever bowling, and Hussey swings it with perfect placement through backward square;
39.5;?;Finn to Hussey, no run back of a length and it's defended this time to cover;
39.4;4;Finn to Hussey, FOUR runs dropped in short, Finn is really struggling here as Hussey hammers away another pull through midwicket;
39.3;4;Finn to Hussey, FOUR runs another boundary, runs flowing, as Hussey goes to fifty with a cut shot backward of square...what a machine this man is. On another rescue mission;

39.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run on off stump, defended to the off side;

38.4;?;Swann to Haddin, no run little flatter and it's defended;
38.3;4;Swann to Haddin, FOUR runs aggression from Haddin, down the pitch and lofts clear of mid-off...wasn't quite out of the middle, but well out of reach of the fielder;
38.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run touch fuller outside off, Haddin onto the front foot and defends to cover;
38.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run bounce outside off and it's cut to backward point;
37.6;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run short again and Haddin brings out the pull, this time picking out deep square-leg;
37.5;?;Finn to Haddin, no run short on off stump, Haddin waits and pushes square into the off side;
37.4;?;Finn to Haddin, no run stands tall and defended down to mid-on;
37.3;?;Finn to Haddin, no run pushed down the leg side;
37.2;4;Finn to Haddin, FOUR runs very full outside off, driven hard into the ground and it bounces over Ian Bell at point to then race away;
37.1;?;Finn to Haddin, no run starts full on the stumps and Haddin defends to mid-on;
36.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run big appeal from Anderson as this swings back into Hussey, but lbws are tough to get on a pitch with bounce like this unless it's very full;
36.5;3;Anderson to Haddin, 3 runs dropped in short again, Haddin responds with a pull that he isn't fully in control of but gets enough of it to clear the infield;
36.4;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run played into the off side;
36.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run short of a length and Haddin is again quickly onto the back foot in defence;

35.6;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run lovely ball to end the over, seams away from Haddin who pushes away from his body and is lucky not to edge it;
35.5;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run extra bounce causes problems again, takes the shoulder of the part but doesn't carry towards gully;
35.4;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run responds with a very short bouncer, close to a wide but it's not called;
35.3;4;Tremlett to Haddin, FOUR runs a cracker from Haddin...floated up full on off stump, met with a crunching straight drive. The batsman can just stand and watch;

34.2;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run touch wider and left alone outside off;
34.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run what a pearler...you don't play them. Seams away late from Hussey who, even in his fine form, can't edge it. Excellent from Anderson;
33.6;2;Tremlett to Haddin, 2 runs almost a run out, and probably should have been. Haddin clips it off his pads towards deep square and decides he wants a second. There was hesitation and the throw from Trott wasn't on target, leaving Prior too much to do even though his flick hit the stumps. Replays show Haddin was in by a few inches;

33.4;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run worked off the pads down to long leg;

32.6;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run he's not holding back, goes for another drive and this time it takes an inside edge into the leg side;
32.5;2;Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs defended firmly from middle and off, Anderson can't get a hand on it and it's also too straight for mid-off;
32.4;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs that's a positive response, driven confidently on the up through the covers...it wasn't a bad ball, played on the up by Haddin;
32.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run this time there are no birds in the way and it nips back into Haddin who defends in a tangle;
32.2;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run pushed into the off side, they set off quickly and despite Ian Bell's shy Hussey was safe;
32.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run almost for Anderson as he finally gets Hussey to play at one of those outside off stump...very close to an edge;
31.6;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run hops back in the crease and pushes out to midwicket;

31.4;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run pushed way down the leg side, that just went wrong from Tremlett;
31.3;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run strangled shout from England as this takes the pad but it's a)pitching outside leg, b) hit the bat and c) was going over. So not out.;

31.1;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run well bowled again, banged in short at the body and Haddin fends it just wide of Cook at short leg...actually played it quite well in the end;

30.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run angled into leg stump, takes the pad out to the leg side;
30.1;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run more busy batting from Hussey as he tucks this off his hip out to deep square-leg;
29.6;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run pushed down the leg side and Haddin steps inside the line;
29.5;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run worked into the leg side...big gaps with deep square-leg back on the fence;
29.4;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run back of a length and that really climbs on the way through to the keeper;
29.3;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run fuller outside off stump, Hussey plants his front foot forward then leaves alone;
29.2;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run short ball outside off and Hussey watches it carefully;
29.1;3;Tremlett to Haddin, 3 runs drifts a little straight and Haddin is able to push this firmly through the vacant on-side field...no one beyond short leg in front of square;
28.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run on middle and off, Hussey defends towards mid-on;
28.5;2;Anderson to Hussey, 2 runs forces this off a thick inside through midwicket...not time, and was probably aiming straight, but it's runs;

28.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run pain for Anderson as Hussey punches this back down the pitch and takes the bowler on the shin...that's goin' to hurt;
27.6;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run back of a length, Haddin squared up a little as he defends to the off side...an superb over from Tremlett;
27.5;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run what a beauty, another full one to follow the short one and Haddin is caught flat-footed on the crease as he plays and misses;
27.4;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run good start, banged in short and rises past Haddin but he pulled the bat nicely inside the line;
27.3;W;Tremlett to Smith, OUT gone! Tremlett strikes again, pitched fuller outside off stump which brought Smith onto the front foot and a comfortable edge flies to Strauss at first slip. Brilliant bowling from Tremlett, short followed by full, and he's having a day to remember;Steven Smith c Strauss b Tremlett 7 (46m 37b 0x4 0x6) SR: 18.91;
27.2;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run back of a length and defended into the leg side;
27.1;2;Tremlett to Smith, 2 runs goes for the pull and gets a big top edge over midwicket, it falls safely but England won't mind him having a dart at the short balls;
26.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run drags the length back a little but Hussey can again leave it well alone;
26.5;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run full but wide of the stumps again so no need for Hussey to play;
26.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run pushed across the left hander and left alone;
26.3;1lb;Anderson to Smith, 1 leg bye down the leg side, takes the pad and Prior can't quite collect this and it's palmed towards fine leg;

Welcome back to the second session of the opening day. Gnasher here to take you through the first hour. England looking to build on their excellent morning and Australia needing Mike Hussey to stage another recovery.
"Bring in Warnie as captain and pick the best bunch of under 23-year-old players in the country and let them play the last two tests," suggets Shaugn . "Can't do any worse. Australia might need to keep the ball and bails and burn them because this is the daeth of Australian cricket."
James Anderson will resume after the break
 Innings Start
The Australians have a lead of 81 and they get into a huddle, savouring the moment. Johnson receives massive cheers from the WACA crowd as he leads his team-mates off the ground. He's been terrific today. The players will take tea now and Watson and Hughes will open Australia's second innings in about 20 minutes.
62.3;W;Johnson to Anderson, OUT it's all over. Johnson has six. Anderson hangs his bat out at a short ball outside off and the edge flies comfortably to Watson at first slip;James Anderson c Watson b Johnson 0 (7m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
62.2;1;Johnson to Finn, 1 run Finn gets off the mark by staying steady and pushing a short of a length delivery towards square leg;
62.1;W;Johnson to Tremlett, OUT gone! Johnson gets five, with a cracking inswinger that takes the off stump out of the ground. Really well bowled and Johnson has deserved that haul - now, can Australia finish England off before tea?;Chris Tremlett b Johnson 2 (21m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;
61.6;?;Harris to Anderson, no run bouncer to finish the over, Anderson gets underneath it;
61.5;?;Harris to Anderson, no run defended safely this time;
61.4;?;Harris to Anderson, no run oh, Harris draws the edge from Anderson but this one has really slowed down and bounced short of Haddin - it seems to have come off the edge of the bat and then flicked the pad on the way through, which slowed it down and saved him;
61.3;?;Harris to Anderson, no run pushed across Anderson, who leaves this one;
61.2;?;Harris to Anderson, no run appeal for lbw! Full and straight but that was inside edge onto pad, so Anderson is safe;
61.1;W;Harris to Bell, OUT Harris gets his third! And it's Ian Bell! It was fullish and well wide of off, swinging away from Bell, who went for the drive but saw his edge fly to Ponting at a wide second slip. That was a sharp catch taken at head height, that ball was travelling;Ian Bell c Ponting b Harris 53 (133m 90b 6x4 0x6) SR: 58.88;
60.6;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run almost had Bell there! Swinging in and full, the big drive from Bell didn't come off, and his inside edge ran past the leg stump and down to fine leg;
60.5;1;Johnson to Tremlett, 1 run wrong line down leg side and Tremlett glances it away for a run to fine leg;

60.3;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run angled across Tremlett, who pushes the ball to cover;
60.2;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run short, down leg side, bad ball - if there's any hint of swing for Johnson he really will have more hope of getting Tremlett by attacking the stumps;
60.1;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run bouncer from Johnson and he's doing well to get it up to Tremlett's head, but Tremlett easily evades it;

57.4;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run at the hips this time and Tremlett's leading edge lobs out to the off side;

56.2;?;Johnson to Swann, no run beaten outside off as Swann drives well inside it;
56.1;?;Johnson to Swann, no run Johnson digs it in short but it's moving across Swann with the angle and he doesn't have to do much to avoid it;
55.6;4;Harris to Bell, FOUR runs c-c-crack! That was a wonderful cut shot, it flies away forward of point and brings Bell his half-century, he really is playing a strong innings, as we've come to expect from him in recent times;

55.4;?;Harris to Bell, no run banged in straighter this time, it's defended with a straight bat;

53.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run outswing again from Hilf, Swann defends;
52.6;?;Johnson to Bell, no run good ball banged in short of a length, Bell gets a leading edge trying to work it to leg;
52.5;2;Johnson to Bell, 2 runs clipped away through midwicket and he picks up two runs;
52.4;?;Johnson to Bell, no run super delivery! That's a cracker, swinging in and comprehensively beating Bell, who was late getting the bat down on that, which may have saved him from edging it;
52.3;?;Johnson to Bell, no run again this one doesn't really swing, just probing outside off and Bell leaves it alone;
52.2;?;Johnson to Bell, no run pushed across Bell, who shoulders arms;
52.1;?;Johnson to Bell, no run bouncer and half a shout from Haddin, who thinks there was a tickle on that, but nobody else shares his conviction;
51.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run a nice ball to finish with, on a good line outside off and that time Swann might have been beaten;

51.2;4;Hilfenhaus to Swann, FOUR runs crutched...Swann brings out a powerful back-foot drive through the covers as he's offered a hint of width. Put it away well;
51.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run short of a length, shaping away past Swann's bat;

50.4;?;Johnson to Bell, no run pushed outside off stump and left alone;

49.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run ah, now that's a good short one, well directed over off stump and it's close to Swann's gloves as he drops his hands. Short balls don't have to start very short here, if you know what I mean;

46.5;?;Siddle to Swann, no run very short to start with, not surprising, and Swann ducks underneath;
46.4;W;Siddle to Prior, OUT gone! Well, the short ball has worked in the end but probably not quite as they expected. The ball after getting hit, Prior moves across his stumps to work it away, but it deflects off his body, back down into his gloves, then down into leg stump to knock off the bail.;Matt Prior b Siddle 12 (62m 42b 1x4 0x6) SR: 28.57;
46.3;?;Siddle to Prior, no run that's a good short ball, clangs Prior on the shoulder as he ducks into the line;

45.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run keeps it outside off, trying to build some pressure, and left alone;

45.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run full outside off and another leave alone from Bell;
45.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run good line outside, still getting some shape and it's left alone;
45.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run full on off stump, defended carefully into the off side;
44.6;?;Siddle to Prior, no run a wasted over as this one also flies down the leg side, harmlessly past the batsman;
44.5;?;Siddle to Prior, no run stays short and over leg stump so Prior moves inside the line again...at least he's sticking to a plan;
44.4;?;Siddle to Prior, no run short over leg stump and Prior jumps inside the line...hello Bodyline?;
44.3;?;Siddle to Prior, no run down the leg side again, but not too far from Prior's gloves as he has a little waft;

43.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run a very short bounce which goes miles over Prior's head...not far from a wide. Umpires have been strict on them in this series;

43.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run back in his crease and defending square;
43.2;4;Hilfenhaus to Prior, FOUR runs neat stroke, full ball which is punched into the pitch and bounces over Hilfenhaus then beats mid-off and comfortably goes to the rope;
43.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run outside off, left alone with the swing;
42.6;?;Siddle to Bell, no run full outside off and left alone to end the over;

42.2;?;Siddle to Bell, no run on off stump and defended towards the on side;
42.1;?;Siddle to Bell, no run fired down the leg side, Haddin makes a fine take as he takes off to his left;
41.6;2;Hilfenhaus to Prior, 2 runs brings out the pull again, and again doesn't connect very well as it loops into the gap at midwicket...Prior hasn't got his timing, yet, and has been troubled by the short ball;
41.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run probing away on off stump, Prior plays back and defends;
41.4;1;Hilfenhaus to Bell, 1 run steps across his crease and flicks this down to long leg, was in the air for a while but well clear of square leg;
41.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run defended back towards the bowler who collects in his follow through;
41.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run shorter outside off and Bell watches this one shape past his off stump;

40.6;?;Siddle to Prior, no run well bowled, jags back into Prior who takes it on the thigh pad and it falls down by his feet;
40.5;?;Siddle to Prior, no run good length outside off and Prior lets it go through;
40.4;1;Siddle to Bell, 1 run goes a little straighter and Bell tucks it away off his hip backward of square. He wants a second but it's not an option;

40.2;?;Siddle to Bell, no run swings away outside off and no shot needed;

38.6;?;Siddle to Prior, no run back outside off and left alone;
38.5;?;Siddle to Prior, no run well, what happened there? Looks like Prior lost that ball and almost lost his off stump too as he failed to pick up a low full toss which just misses the timber as Prior flays late at the ball;
38.4;?;Siddle to Prior, no run good length on off stump, defended into the off side;
38.3;3;Siddle to Bell, 3 runs lovely from Bell, boy he looks in good form, as he drives a delivery from off stump elegantly through the covers but mid-off manages to haul it in;
38.2;1;Siddle to Prior, 1 run good yorker, Siddle trying for a repeat of how he did Prior at the Gabba, but's squeezed out through gully who will probably feel he should have cut it off;

37.6;?;Harris to Bell, no run good line outside off, and it's left alone;

37.4;1;Harris to Prior, 1 run ooh, Prior again miscues a pull and this one lobs safely just wide of midwicket, Prior was surprised by the speed of it and wasn't watching the ball when he connected with it in front of his eyes;
37.3;3;Harris to Bell, 3 runs Harris draws Bell into a drive and it's a thick edge that runs away through point, not where Bell intended that ball to go;
37.2;?;Harris to Bell, no run better line now outside off stump and it's defended safely back down the pitch;
37.1;?;Harris to Bell, no run down leg side now, Haddin roars an appeal which is all the more noticeable as nobody else in the Australian team says a word!;
37.1;1w;Harris to Bell, 1 wide huge swing, and terribly wide of off, Haddin does well to dive in front of Watson at first slip and take it, but that's clearly a wide;
36.6;4b;Siddle to Prior, 4 byes d'oh! Wrong line entirely from Siddle as he sprays one down leg, Haddin has no chance of stopping this and it's been called byes;
36.5;3;Siddle to Bell, 3 runs well placed, Bell just guides this through cover, punching it off the back foot and finding the gap;
36.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run great ball, after all the short stuff, Siddle goes fuller and gets some movement away from Bell, who pushes outside off and misses the ball;
36.3;?;Siddle to Bell, no run short of a length again, Bell jumps back and nudges it to Hughes at short leg on the bounce;
36.2;?;Siddle to Bell, no run bouncer, over the head of Bell, who re-marks his guard and looks all focused and serious;

35.5;?;Harris to Prior, no run attacking the stumps again, Prior pushes to leg;
35.4;2;Harris to Prior, 2 runs pulled, top-edged! And safe! It's landed halfway to the square leg boundary, and there's no fielder there;

35.2;?;Harris to Prior, no run ah, fullish and swinging back down the line a touch, Prior defends;

32.5;?;Johnson to Prior, no run left alone outside off;
32.4;?;Johnson to Prior, no run pushed across Prior, who leaves it alone;
32.3;W;Johnson to PD Collingwood, OUT another lbw shout as this one swings in, but it's given not out. Ponting asks for a review, but that looked high and off-side.

32.2;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run pushed away to point;
32.1;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run cracking bouncer! Dead straight, and quick, and Collingwood jumps, trying to fend, and then tries to get out of the way - just managing to do so. That really tested him;
31.6;?;Harris to Bell, no run beaten! This one doesn't swing as much as Bell expected and it's flown between bat and pad - this is terrific stuff!;
31.5;4;Harris to Bell, FOUR runs oh, good shot! As if to confirm that he won't be worried by the situation, Bell just punches a confident off drive back between Harris and the man at mid-off, beautiful timing;
31.4;?;Harris to Bell, no run good probing line just outside off, Bell defends solidly;
31.3;W;Harris to Strauss, OUT Harris joins the party! Strauss is gone! An edge behind and Haddin takes the straightforward catch!

30.2;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood tries to pull one of the hips, can't connect;

29.4;?;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, no run again it swings away, again Collingwood plays no shot;

27.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run defended back down the pitch;
26.6;W;Johnson to Pietersen, OUT another one! Pietersen is gone for a duck! Beautiful bowling from Johnson as this one swings back down the line, Marais Erasmus gives it lbw and Pietersen wants a review. The bat was nowhere near it, and at first glance it looked like it could have slid down leg but that's a great decision - the replays show that crashing right into leg stump.;Kevin Pietersen lbw b Johnson 0 (2m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

23.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run fuller this time and a much easier leave;
23.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run just like that! It's a ripper which zings back at Strauss from short of a length and he has to be quick to get his gloves out of the way;

21.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run good line outside off, Strauss thinks of playing before lifting the bat high out of the line;

21.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run Hilfenhuas has been very good today and this is another nice delivery, back of a length outside off stump and Strauss is beaten;
20.6;1;Johnson to Strauss, 1 run pushed outside leg stump and it's flicked away down to long leg...not a good delivery;
20.5;?;Johnson to Strauss, no run full outside off with a hint of shape away from Strauss as he leaves;
20.4;2;Johnson to Strauss, 2 runs on leg stump and worked away through square leg, this time there's good running to make it into a couple;

19.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Cook, no run full outside off, squeezed out towards gully where Mike Hussey makes a good save to support his bowler;

16.5;4;Harris to Strauss, FOUR runs another short one, this sits up and gives Strauss oodles of time to pull this off the front foot forward of square...deep square can't get around. That was a bit of a long hop;

14.3;?;Harris to Strauss, no run outside off and left alone;
14.2;4;Harris to Strauss, FOUR runs dropped on my goodness, they've missed another. Back of a length, Strauss pushes hard and the edge flies between keeper and first slip but neither Haddin or Watson even went for the chance. What a let off for Strauss;
14.1;3;Harris to Cook, 3 runs well played by Cook, full outside off and he leans into a cover drive which finds the gap at cover...not quite the legs to reach the boundary, but a pleasing start for him;

12.4;?;Harris to Cook, no run back of a length, Cook stands tall in the crease and pushes into the covers;

10.3;1;Siddle to Cook, 1 run good yorker, swinging in a touch but in this form Cook is good enough to clip that away behind square leg;
10.2;?;Siddle to Cook, no run banged in short of a length, Cook works it to leg;
10.1;2;Siddle to Cook, 2 runs well played by Cook, he punches this off the back foot behind point and gets a couple;
9.6;4;Johnson to Strauss, FOUR runs cut hard and just wide of gully! That was hit uppishly but timed well, and Hussey at gully wasn't ever going to catch that, a very good shot, if a tad more aerial than Strauss intended;

8.1;?;Siddle to Cook, no run horrid start from Siddle, almost as if he's held that ball the wrong way around! It's swung waaaay down leg, and Haddin does tremendously to dive across and stop that with his right hand;
7.6;?;Harris to Strauss, no run down leg side again, Strauss tries to glance but can't connect;
7.5;?;Harris to Strauss, no run shorter, and it's quick at 139kph, Strauss ducks it;
7.4;?;Harris to Strauss, no run again it's angled across, again Strauss isn't interested;
7.3;?;Harris to Strauss, no run pushed right across Strauss, who offers nothing;
7.2;?;Harris to Strauss, no run on the back foot now, Strauss defends;
7.1;?;Harris to Strauss, no run Harris continues, and pushes it across Strauss, who leaves it alone;
6.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Cook, no run good line, swinging in to just outside off and Cook defends;
6.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Cook, no run left alone again outside off;
6.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Cook, no run pushed back to Hilfenhaus defensively;
6.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Cook, no run angled across Cook, who leaves;
6.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Cook, no run better line on off, Cook clips to midwicket;
6.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Cook, no run Hilfenhaus gets some more inswing, but it's wide enough of off to be left alone without incident;

It may not be long before we see Mitchell Johnson for the first time in his return. For now, it's Peter Siddle to take the ball from Ben Hilfenhaus.
 Innings Start
Fine effort from Hussey and also from Chris Tremlett. Coming back into Test cricket after three years he's taken eight in the match. It leaves England with 391 to chase, which is plenty, but we're all familiar with this match by now. It may all come down to whether of not Mitchell Johnson can find swing again. Batsmen around the world, it seems, can play anything but a moving ball. Maybe they should take up golf. England's top order was devastated by Johnson's inswing, the wind from the east at the moment is exactly what it was like then but Johnson himself conceded he doesn't know how and if he can do it. Australia are having their huddle, Ponting's words could be to the effect of "lose from here and my job is toast". Strauss and Cook come bounding out, this is going to be a cracking session.
85.6;W;Tremlett to Hussey, OUT Tremlett has his fifth, as England eventually are rewarded for bouncing Hussey, but not after a magnificent innings. His 116 could separate the teams. It was short and pulled very hard to Swann at deep midwicket who clung on;Michael Hussey c Swann b Tremlett 116 (296m 172b 15x4 0x6) SR: 67.44;
85.5;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run ooh, Tremlett is lucky to get away with this, short and wide and murdered to point;
85.4;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run cracker, that's the place to do it for Tremlett, on a length around off stump, seams away and beats Hussey's outside edge;
85.3;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run ah, so Hussey won't take the single, he'll wait for the field to come in... this could get interesting;
85.2;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run good delivery here, much fuller and some inswing, thuds away off Hussey's pads and trickles back to the bowler;
85.1;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run that's a gentle start, outside off stump and left alone, the field is set very deep, will Hussey take the single when it's offered?;
84.6;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run touch too wide to finish a good Anderson over;
84.5;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run that's a beauty, full, swinging away, beating the outside edge. Would have been good enough for Haddin but not the Hilf;
84.4;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run this is a bit better again and Hilfenhaus prods half-heartedly at it;
84.3;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run slightly closer this time, but not enough to make Hilfenhaus play;
84.3;1w;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, 1 wide well if the last was wide this was even worse, too much so for the umpire's liking;
84.2;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run too wide to interest the tailender, left well alone outside the off stump;
84.1;W;Anderson to Siddle, OUT Anderson strikes, his 200th Test wicket. Good delivery, the simple virtue of pitching the ball up, finding some away movement, clips the edge and Collingwood holds the catch at slip;Peter Siddle c Collingwood b Anderson 8 (33m 26b 1x4 0x6) SR: 30.76;
83.6;4;Tremlett to Hussey, FOUR runs oh dear, dreadful ball to finish a poor opening first over after tea, short, wide, four. Crashed over cover off the back foot;
83.5;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run field comes in for Hussey and this is a good delivery on and around off stump that's left alone;
83.4;1;Tremlett to Siddle, 1 run short again and flicked off the hip onto Cook's shin at short leg, cannoned away for a single to bring Hussey on strike;
83.3;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run better delivery this time, the line is around off stump, the length too short though and Siddle has plenty of time to defend;
83.2;4;Tremlett to Siddle, FOUR runs oh dear, poor start from Tremlett here, this is a half-tracker that's gloved down the leg side, fine leg is very square so can't catch up with it;
83.1;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run back of a length, touch of extra bounce as always but really that length is wrong, Hussey steered a cut to deep point, via a seagull, who tumbled as it fielded;
83.1;1w;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 wide oops, shoved very wide of off stump, too wide for Hussey to reach;
82.6;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run and it's tea, short outside off and Siddle has nothing to do with it;
82.5;2;Anderson to Siddle, 2 runs good work with the wrists this time, a straight delivery from Anderson and it's flicked past midwicket for a brace;
82.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run a textbook front-foot defence, appreciated by this capacity crowd, solidly in front of the bowler;
82.3;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run shortish on the off, punched off the back foot past extra cover;
82.2;1lb;Anderson to Siddle, 1 leg bye angling it on the leg stump and Siddle tries to turn it around the corner, clips his thighs, wide of Prior, and a leg bye to the total;
82.1;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run bowls it on a good length and Hussey, with enough confidence in his partner, taps it gently into the off side to race through for a single;
81.6;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run banged it short, a harmless bouncer in the end, Siddle ducks under it with ease;
81.5;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run lands on a good length on the off, driven through to extra cover;
81.4;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run pitched up by Colly this time, on middle, pushed through the line to mid-on;
81.3;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run Siddle's flirting with her there, short outside off and he tries to play the cut, is a little late on that one, misses;
81.2;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run lands on a good length on the off, is knocked down into the leg side off the back foot;
81.1;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run a trifle outside off and it's left alone by Siddle;
80.6;?;Finn to Hussey, no run pulls it this time, wasn't too wide, wanted to smack it past midwicket but didn';t get hold, Siddle on strike the next over;
80.5;?;Finn to Hussey, no run content on leaving the widish ones is Hussey and he leaves that one be;
80.4;1;Finn to Siddle, 1 run ooh, just wide of Cook at short leg, short on the body and Siddle works it, uppishly, to the left of Cook, just evaded the man, a quick single follows;
80.3;?;Finn to Siddle, no run back of a length on middle, gets on the back foot and knocks it down to midwicket;
80.2;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run driven on the up, lands around a good length, it's driven down to long-off for a single;
80.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run short of a good length outside off, angling away, Hussey leaves it alone;
79.6;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run bowls it on a good length on middle and off, Siddle is nicely behind it and taps it into the off side;
79.5;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run Hussey cuts behind point and gets a single;
79.4;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run Hussey goes for the cover drive now but picks out the fielder;
79.3;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run pushed across Hussey now and he leaves it;
79.2;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run slower ball and right on target, Hussey just nudges it back to Collingwood;
79.1;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run good ball, nipping back in to Hussey, who gets bat and pad close together to defend;
78.6;?;Finn to Siddle, no run and again Finn goes for the bouncer, Siddle ducks and then smiles as he realises he's survived to give Hussey the strike;
78.5;?;Finn to Siddle, no run straight bat from Siddle now as he defends to leg;
78.4;?;Finn to Siddle, no run bouncer, and Siddle happily squats under it, economical with his movement;
78.3;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run pushed wide of cover and Hussey is happy to take the single and give Siddle three balls to survive;
78.2;?;Finn to Hussey, no run this time Hussey doesn't chase it outside off;
78.1;4;Finn to Hussey, FOUR runs that's just brilliant batting, Hussey has picked the length and driven through the off side along the ground, but the most impressive thing is the placement between cover and mid off, where the gap is not at all vast;
77.6;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run dropped! Collingwood should have had two in three overs! He tossed it up outside off and drew the drive from Siddle, who sent it just to the right of short cover, where Swann moved across and spilled what he should have taken.;
77.5;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run ah, Colly sends down the slower ball, but Siddle picks it and pushes to point;
77.4;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run short ball, but it's wide of off and Siddle is disciplined enough not to chase it;
77.3;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run half-volley on off stump and Siddle drives to mid-off;
77.2;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run fullish and probing outside off, Siddle defends;
77.1;?;PD Collingwood to Siddle, no run on the stumps and Siddle defends;
76.6;?;Finn to Hussey, no run beaten outside off! Hussey was pushing, trying to get the single through cover to keep the strike, but Finn's length was just right;
76.5;?;Finn to Hussey, no run again Hussey leaves one angling across him;
76.4;?;Finn to Hussey, no run Finn pushes it across Hussey, who leaves it alone;
76.3;?;Finn to Hussey, no run on the back foot, Hussey punches to the off side;
76.2;W;Finn to Harris, OUT Finn strikes! Not smart at all from Harris, as he pulls straight to Ian Bell at deep midwicket, where he takes a comfortable catch;Ryan Harris c Bell b Finn 1 (14m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;
76.1;?;Finn to Harris, no run banged in at the hips of Harris, who works it into the ground to short leg;
75.6;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run solid, really solidly pushed to cover, but can't find a run and gives Harris the strike;

74.5;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run flicked off the pads through midwicket;
74.4;1;Tremlett to Harris, 1 run oh boy! Not convincing from Harris as Tremlett angles it in to the stumps and nearly gets it through Harris, who just manages to clip it away behind square leg;
74.3;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run pulled around the corner to fine leg for a single;
74.2;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run left alone outside off;
74.1;4;Tremlett to Hussey, FOUR runs and there's the hundred for Hussey! And fittingly he gets there with a pull, cracking it through the gap at midwicket. He shouts "get in there!" as he sees the ball heading wide of square leg and leaps for joy as the ball hits the boundary;
73.6;?;PD Collingwood to Harris, no run 'noooo', comes the shout from Harris as he defends to off with bat and pad close together;
73.6;1w;PD Collingwood to Harris, 1 wide bouncer! Collingwood gets in on the act, but it was too short and went far too high, and Billy Doctrove calls it a wide;
73.5;?;PD Collingwood to Harris, no run straight bat outside off, Harris prods it back to Collingwood;
73.4;?;PD Collingwood to Harris, no run swinging away just a touch outside off, Harris leaves it alone;
73.3;W;PD Collingwood to Johnson, OUT Collingwood strikes! England are back in this big time! Johnson has gone for the cover drive but the lack of pace did him and he didn't quite commit to the stroke, just prodding it to Bell at short cover;Mitchell Johnson c Bell b Collingwood 1 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
73.2;?;PD Collingwood to Johnson, no run oh, Collingwood has beaten the outside edge! Nicely done, this looks to straighten in the air and then nips away a touch off the seam;
73.1;?;PD Collingwood to Johnson, no run pushed across Johnson, who leaves it alone;
72.6;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run Tremlett goes for the bouncer again, but it's too wide of off for Hussey to pull;
72.5;4;Tremlett to Hussey, FOUR runs why oh why would you keep bowling short to Hussey? Again, he pulls from in front of his face, gets it down into the ground and finds the gap wide of fine leg;
72.4;1;Tremlett to Johnson, 1 run not a bad ball, trying for the yorker first up but it was just wide of leg stump and Johnson glanced it away to fine leg;
72.3;W;Tremlett to Haddin, OUT Haddin is gone this time! And Tremlett gets his fourth wicket! He goes a bit fuller and nips the ball in a fraction off the seam, Haddin is in two minds as to going forward or back, just gets an inside edge onto his pad and back onto the stumps;Brad Haddin b Tremlett 7 (17m 10b 0x4 1x6) SR: 70;
72.2;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run oh boy! Not a well-judged single! Hussey nudges wide of cover and takes off, and Haddin was not going to get there, but Collingwood's usually reliable arm couldn't hit from almost side on, although he only missed by a hair's breadth. Haddin was gooooone.;
72.1;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run Tremlett goes for the bouncer again, but it's wide of off and Hussey sways away;
71.6;?;PD Collingwood to Haddin, no run solidly defended from off stump, well bowled by Collingwood;
71.5;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run this time Hussey chases a wider one and cuts to deep point;

71.3;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run on the back foot, Hussey punches to cover;
71.2;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run pushed across Hussey, who leaves it;
71.1;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run Hussey is watchful straight away, leaving one to go through outside off;
70.6;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run short and outside off stump, Haddin sways out of the line;
70.5;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run clearly the England players know something we don't...it's short again and hammered out to deep midwicket;
70.4;2;Tremlett to Hussey, 2 runs a crunching pull from Hussey, England still feeding his shot, but Finn makes a brilliant save out at deep midwicket...great effort from the tall fast bowler;
70.3;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run and Haddin runs this down to third man through the vacant cordon;
70.2;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run another short one which is pulled down to long leg;

69.4;6;Swann to Haddin, SIX runs he's not wasting any time, down on one knee and swept high over midwicket...clears the ropes easily;
69.3;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run uses his feet and meets this outside off, drives down to long-off;
69.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run back on a length and worked to short leg;
69.1;4;Swann to Hussey, FOUR runs Short. Hussey. Pulled. Four. (you know how it works). Not good bowling from Swann;
68.6;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run short and towards the body again, Haddin moves inside the line and the ball clips his leg through to Prior;
68.6;1nb;Tremlett to Haddin, (no ball) angling across outside off, short of a length and defended to the off side...Tremlett's overstepped;
68.5;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run ooh, not a million miles away as Haddin jumps across his crease and wafts at the delivery. He misses and it travels over middle stump;
68.4;W;Tremlett to Smith, OUT gone, the short ball plan works to Smith. Down the leg side and it glances the glove down the leg side through to Prior as Smith pushes away from his body;Steven Smith c ?Prior b Tremlett 36 (83m 62b 2x4 0x6) SR: 58.06;
68.3;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run and it was short, Smith ends up way outside off as he gets underneath the ball;

67.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run down the pitch and defends;
67.1;1;Swann to Smith, 1 run whipped into the on side and midwicket dives over it to allow a single...England starting to look pretty tired now;
66.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run defended off the back foot with soft hands, ball rolls towards gully;
66.5;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run fuller and a little wider and another leave...Hussey in no rush, he doesn't need to be;
66.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run stays outside off and Hussey shoulders arms again;
66.3;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run same again outside off and left alone;
66.2;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run outside off and left alone;
66.1;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run flicked off leg stump with a flourish out to deep square;
65.6;4;Swann to Hussey, FOUR runs stunning shot from Hussey, uses his feet and drills it past short cover...glorious again;

60.6;?;Anderson to Smith, no run well bowled from Anderson, beats the inside edge this time as Smith drives off the back foot;
60.5;?;Anderson to Smith, no run Another big appeal and this time they review. A full ball and Smith falls over as he plays to leg. My goodness, this is close, but it's the umpires' call by a millimetre or two so Smith survives;

60.2;?;Anderson to Smith, no run full on middle and off, defended straight down the pitch;
60.1;?;Anderson to Smith, no run fired down the leg side, takes the pad and there's a great take from Prior - who has been excellent with the gloves - and he thinks there's bat involved, but the bowler and captain aren't convinced;

59.5;2;Finn to Hussey, 2 runs lovely shot as he waits then guides it backward of point...the sweeper cuts off a boundary;

59.3;?;Finn to Hussey, no run fuller outside off and left alone;
59.2;4;Finn to Hussey, FOUR runs guess what. It's another short ball and it's another four for Hussey as he pulls it though square leg. Even the deep fielders couldn't reach it;

57.1;3;Finn to Smith, 3 runs lovely start after the break for Smith, forces off the back foot through the covers...he was uncertain before lunch, but is a confident cricketer;
56.6;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run Hussey's given out lbw! Ah, but he has quickly asked for a review, knowing the bounce at the WACA so well. And Hussey is shown to be correct - even though he was back in his crease, he was struck well above the knee roll and the replays show that was going over the top. He survives!;
56.5;1;Tremlett to Smith, 1 run shouts of 'caaaatch' as Smith pulls in the air, Ian Bell at deep midwicket dives forward and just can't get there to make the catch, doing well enough though to save the runs;
56.4;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run short ball, Hussey pulls through square leg for a single;
56.3;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run probing outside off, Hussey lets it go;
56.2;1;Tremlett to Smith, 1 run good, quick running as Smith nudges to cover and takes off for a quick single, he's every bit as fast between the wickets as Mike Hussey;

55.2;?;Anderson to Smith, no run good ball to Smith, trying to force through the gap between bat and pad, and he just gets the bat down to clip it to leg;
55.1;3;Anderson to Hussey, 3 runs and immediately he drops a touch short to Hussey, who is so quick on the pull, getting it down into the ground and away through midwicket, it's chased down on the rope but that was another really well-timed pull;
54.6;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run shortish on the hips, and Smith carefully lifts the bat to ensure there's no glove down leg side as he leaves this one alone;
54.5;4;Tremlett to Smith, FOUR runs and that's Smith's answer! A smashing pull forward of square leg, there are three men back on the leg side and he's still found the gap, bouncing it over the boundary for his first four;
54.4;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run solidly defended by Smith off the back foot;
54.3;2;Tremlett to Smith, 2 runs ha! That is really quite remarkable! Smith gets a short ball and tries to sway back out of the way, but leaves his bat up a little bit. The ball clips the bat and flies in the air over the head of Prior, who runs back and just fails to get there in time;
54.2;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run bouncer again, Smith ducks once more;
54.2;1w;Tremlett to Smith, 1 wide banged in short, not surprisingly, but Smith ducks it safely. In fact, Marais Erasmus is not convinced that was hittable, and calls it a wide.;
54.1;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run Smith defends solidly back down the pitch;
53.6;4;Finn to Hussey, FOUR runs wonderful pull this time, if that last ball was misjudged, this one was perfectly performed! Hussey crunches it in the air through midwicket and that ball is really flying as it bounces over the boundary;
53.5;?;Finn to Hussey, no run oops, Hussey goes for the pull but just gets a bottom edge onto his hip, and is lucky as the ball lobs over the stumps instead of onto them;
53.4;?;Finn to Hussey, no run bouncer, but too high to worry Hussey;
53.3;3;Finn to Smith, 3 runs good shot, Smith gets this cover drive through the gap although it's not quite timed well enough to reach the boundary;
53.2;?;Finn to Smith, no run punched off the back foot to point;
53.1;?;Finn to Smith, no run banged in short of a length outside off and Smith reaches to defend;
52.6;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run oh, mix-up! And Smith survives as Tremlett can't hit the stumps! My word, Hussey really sold his partner down the river there, nudging to leg and calling yes then no, but Smith was already halfway down the pitch, Tremlett collected and turned to throw, and couldn't hit at the non-striker's end.;
52.5;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run a little bit of shape in from Tremlett, and Hussey leaves it;
52.4;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run left alone outside off;
52.3;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run solidly defended back down the pitch;
52.2;4;Tremlett to Hussey, FOUR runs that's a genuine edge, but it's run away to third man for a boundary! Phew, Hussey was a tad lucky there as it was just to the right of gully, though just wouldn't quite have carried to him;
52.1;2;Tremlett to Hussey, 2 runs Tremlett goes short of a length again and Hussey pulls, rolling the wrists to keep that down through midwicket;
51.6;2;Finn to Smith, 2 runs top-edged pull and it's just safe! Oh, Smith wasn't in control there as he tried to get it over square leg, Tremlett at fine leg runs around to his left and just doesn't get to the ball in time to catch it;
51.5;?;Finn to Smith, no run defends with a straight bat this time;
51.4;2;Finn to Smith, 2 runs punched off the back foot through cover point, that looked really ungainly from Smith, dangling the bat outside off, but it was effective;
51.3;?;Finn to Smith, no run gets forward to defend;
51.2;?;Finn to Smith, no run Smith's been given out caught at slip but he wants a review. And he survives! That was an odd one, it looked close for lbw but he seemed to be given out only after the catch was taken at slip. Smith immediately reviewed, knowing he hadn't hit it, and the replays show clear space between bat and ball. And just for good measure, it was going over the top of the stumps as well.;
51.1;?;Finn to Smith, no run angling down the leg side, Smith doesn't get bat on ball;
50.6;2;Tremlett to Hussey, 2 runs Hussey closes the face and works this through square leg, and absolutely motors back for a second run that many batsmen around the world wouldn't have managed;
50.5;1;Tremlett to Smith, 1 run and Smith is off the mark with a nudge through cover for a single;
50.4;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run pushed away to point, good line testing him outside off;
50.3;?;Tremlett to Smith, no run ouch! First up, Tremlett gives Smith a blow to the chest as the batsman leaves a ball that really rises off a good length;
50.2;W;Tremlett to Watson, OUT Watson's gone! Tremlett has got him for 95 with a straight ball that strikes him on the pad in front, Marais Erasmus gives it out and Watson wants the review. There's no bat involved, and it was clearly hitting the stumps. He's missed his hundred, oh, Shane!;Shane Watson lbw b Tremlett 95 (221m 174b 11x4 0x6) SR: 54.59;
50.1;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run Tremlett bounces in and targets the off stump, Watson defends solidly;
49.6;1;Finn to Watson, 1 run another good single gets Watson to 95 as he nudges forward of point;
49.5;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run angling in to the off stump, where Hussey closes the face and works a single wide of midwicket;
49.4;?;Finn to Hussey, no run on the back foot, Hussey defends;
49.3;?;Finn to Hussey, no run that's rather slow at 131kph, Hussey watches it through to Prior and it almost seems to stop in mid-air on the way through to him, such is the lack of pace;
49.2;?;Finn to Hussey, no run Finn is around the wicket to Hussey, who leaves it outside off;
49.1;1;Finn to Watson, 1 run and this time it's Watson who pulls, just gently to the man at deep midwicket;
48.6;2;Tremlett to Hussey, 2 runs too full and too wide from Tremlett, and Hussey square drives confidently to the man at deep point;
48.5;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run again no shot from Hussey, who leaves a ball angling in towards him;
48.4;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run left alone outside off;
48.3;4;Tremlett to Hussey, FOUR runs well, that little break hasn't affected Hussey's focus! That's a magnificent pull, rocking back and crunching that in the air wide of mid-on, what a stroke;
48.2;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run angling in from around the wicket and Hussey gets back into his crease to defend;
48.1;3;Tremlett to Watson, 3 runs another terrific cover drive from Watson, though this one was knocked down at short cover - but the timing was still good enough to almost reach the boundary;
47.6;4;Finn to Hussey, FOUR runs poor, pretty poor, as Finn loses his line down the leg side from round the wicket and it's flicked fine past the keeper off the pad;
47.5;1;Finn to Watson, 1 run this time it's a low full toss on the stumps, flicked out to deep square-leg;
47.4;?;Finn to Watson, no run drags his length back a touch and it's left alone;
47.3;4;Finn to Watson, FOUR runs another very full ball, Finn's really struggling, and Watson drives it through cover for consecutive boundaries;
47.2;4;Finn to Watson, FOUR runs oooh, what a shot. Watson has been hitting the field for a while, but this sends a half volley races past mid-off. Placement and timing.;
47.1;?;Finn to Watson, no run defended into the off side;
46.6;4;Anderson to Hussey, FOUR runs now he finds the gap, width from Anderson allows Hussey to drive through the covers...top shot, the hard work paying off;
46.5;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run;
46.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run back of a length outside off, Hussey still happy to leave alone and wear the bowlers down;

45.6;?;Finn to Hussey, no run ends with a short ball that rises past off stump and Hussey drops his hands;
45.5;?;Finn to Hussey, no run stays round the wicket, pushed down to mid-on but not quite timed on this occasion;
45.4;?;Finn to Hussey, no run another sweet shot that brings nothing as Hussey rifles a half volley straight to cover;
45.3;?;Finn to Hussey, no run full on middle and off, worked down to mid-on;

44.1;?;Anderson to Watson, no run outside off and left alone...tight again from Anderson;
43.6;4lb;Finn to Hussey, 4 leg byes wrong line and easily put away from Hussey down to fine leg, actually comes off the pad...that's been Finn's problem, at least one four-ball per over;
43.5;1;Finn to Watson, 1 run goes short and Watson is cramped on a pull, gets a bottom edge into his body and towards square leg;
43.4;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run makes contact this time, uses the angle to work this through midwicket but Trott is quickly onto it in the deep;
43.3;?;Finn to Hussey, no run angled down the leg side and Hussey doesn't make contact;

32.2;4;Finn to Watson, FOUR runs magnificent cover drive! It may be near stumps but Watson is going to play his shots, and latches on to a half-volley that he weaves through the gap between cover and mid off, great shot;
32.1;?;Finn to Watson, no run left alone outside off;
31.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run drifting in and spinning away, Hussey watches it onto the bat and pushes to cover;
31.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run drifting in and that's a better line, attacking the off stump, but Hussey is good enough to defend;
31.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run tossed up outside off, Hussey defends;
31.3;3;Swann to Watson, 3 runs too short and wide, Watson cuts forward of point and picks up more runs;
31.2;3;Swann to Hussey, 3 runs fine batting, really wonderful footwork from Hussey as he gets to the pitch of it and drives through cover, Pietersen really tests his hamstring by chasing and diving to make the save;
31.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Swann drifts down leg from around the wicket, Hussey can't beat Cook at short leg;

30.5;?;Finn to Watson, no run shorter and wider of off, Watson leaves it alone;

30.3;?;Finn to Watson, no run fuller ball from Finn, Watson drives a bump ball to short cover;

28.5;?;Finn to Watson, no run left alone outside off, good bounce from Finn but not making Watson play;

 Innings Start
What a fast finish, it's taken Australia only 50 minutes this morning to finish off England and take the remaining five wickets. There are handshakes all round now, but the Australians are the only ones smiling. Ricky Ponting runs out on to the WACA with his broken little finger bandaged and congratulates all his team-mates, a huge smile on his face as he knows this series is well and truly alive.
Ryan Harris has collected a stump, after finishing with 6 for 47. "We knew it was going to be a bouncy wicket and England haven't played that well here in the past," Harris says. He's done the job in this innings, but it was Mitchell Johnson who turned the match on its head on the second day with a wonderful spell of fast, swing bowling, and he's ended up with nine wickets for the match. Mike Hussey's batting was magnificent, yet again, and he deserves plenty of credit for this win.
Stand by for the presentations...
Andrew Strauss: "We were in quite a good position but a very good spell of bowling by Mitchell Johnson brought Australia back into the game. You've got to give them credit... We've also got to retain a sense of perspective ... We've played a lot of good cricket in this series... We thought we could get 391, but that session last night killed us."
Ricky Ponting, on his 36th birthday: "There's no better birthday present than that, to bounce back like this... To get 270 on the board on that first day was probably the difference in the end, and then Johnson's spell on day two was probably one of the all-time greatest spells in Ashes history."
"I'm a bit sore today, I wanted more than anything to be able to go out there and field, but I had to err on the side of caution. Another knock on the finger could have been disastrous. I think I'm a really good chance of playing the Boxing Day Test."
And the Man of the Match is Mitchell Johnson. "It was disappointing to miss Adelaide, but I knew I had to work on a few things," Johnson says. "I really enjoy bowling here. Hopefully I can be as consistent as I was here in the next two Tests."
That's it from the WACA, where Australia have bounced back to level the series. England fans might disagree, but it is encouraging that the series is still alive heading in to Boxing Day at the MCG, where the situation is the same as it was here - England win, and they retain the Ashes. Andrew McGlashan has written the tale of this short day's play, and you can find that bulletin here. There'll be plenty of reading over the coming hours from Peter English and Andrew Miller at the WACA, so do stick around for that.

35.5;?;Johnson to Finn, no run bouncer! It's ducked by Finn;
35.4;W;Johnson to Swann, OUT Johnson gets his third! Swann has played on, just a flat-footed drive that he wanted to force through the off side, it was a good length and Swann could only get a thick inside edge onto his off stump;Graeme Swann b Johnson 9 (8m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 180;
35.3;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs more runs for Swann, as he tries to hook the bouncer but is surprised by the bounce and gets it off the top edge over the keeper for a boundary;

33.6;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run ooh, nearly a chance...he drives and gets a thick outside edge which falls short of backward point;

32.5;2;Harris to Prior, 2 runs worked away through square leg off middle and off, Harris feels he has a chance here;

30.2;4;Harris to Bell, FOUR runs hint of width and Bell hammers it behind square with a powerful cut;
30.1;?;Harris to Bell, no run big appeal for lbw, Bell plays across a straight ball but it's given not out. Will Michael Clarke ask for a review? No, he won't and it was indeed going over;

26.5;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run nudged away behind square by Collingwood, not in much control of that. Collingwood wanted a single but Anderson didn't - but his job as nightwatchman is to protect Collingwood;

23.1;?;Johnson to Trott, no run no swing first up, and it's defended back down the pitch;

22.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run fuller and straighter, Trott works it to mid-on;

21.2;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run on the back foot, Collingwood pushes to cover;
21.1;4;Siddle to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs cut in the air and it's four! Collingwood did manage to get the ball between gully and the slips, but he was really surprised by how close that one came to his body, and in the end he wasn't quite in control;
20.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run short, ducked - nothing to see here;

17.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run a big stride forward now as KP defends;
17.2;1nb;Siddle to Pietersen, (no ball) that's a beautiful ball, angling in and seaming away past the outside edge, but Siddle is probably happy not to have gotten the edge as it was called a no-ball;

16.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Trott, no run good swing and full enough to entice the drive, Trott pushes it to cover and the Australians won't mind him playing at that;

11.5;?;Johnson to Trott, no run this is short so won't swing, Trott defends;
11.4;2;Johnson to Trott, 2 runs right, the couple worked off the inside edge isn't the significant thing here, no, what matters is that Johnson swung that delivery. Look out England;
