After a long series of hearing Boonie and Beefy endlessly (in fairness, Beefy shut up around the middle of the Sydney Test), the Boonie doll has just been served up as a leg-side full toss to Andrew Miller and he smashed it ...straight into Andrew McGlashan who was writing a story and was unaware of other activity. We can report McGlashan's shoulder is fine and Boonie is in six pieces. Hopes he had been finally silenced were scotched when the remains of the base chirped in with "take that your majesty" a few second later.
A really tight last ten overs from Australia that might be the difference between the sides. England were again indebted to Paul Collingwood as well as Andrew Flintoff - the two added 97 for the fifth wicket - but Australia bowled well and fielded superbly. We'll be back at 7.15pm (0815GMT) for the second innings.
McGrath leads the team off to an amazing reception ... he turns just before he is engulfed by the pavilion and waves to all parts of the ground.

32.5;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run good length once again. Defended;
32.4;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run half an appeal from McGrath, that was fuller and swung late into Flintoff's pads. Missing leg by some distance;
32.3;2;McGrath to Flintoff, 2 runs shorter, and an attacking swipe from Flintoff brings third man into play. But he's safely back for the second before the throw comes in;

31.4;1w;Hogg to PD Collingwood, 1 wide misdirected this time, speared down the leg side;
31.3;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run groans again as Collingwood defends a touch tentatively outside off. Probing stuff;
31.2;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run solidly forward and defended out to point. Squeaked appeal;
31.1;1;Hogg to Flintoff, 1 run big stride, and a measured drive into the covers;
30.6;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run shorter again, and dabbed to third man to complete a tidy over;

30.4;1;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 1 run shorter and into the hips, turned square but without any force;
30.3;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run on the spot again. Collingwood is back in his crease, defending with the bat angled downwards;

29.1;?;Hogg to PD Collingwood, no run another googly from Hogg, and Collingwood is beaten going for a cut;
28.6;4;Lee to Flintoff, FOUR runs too wide from Lee, and Flintoff uses his pace to slash outside off and give McGrath at third man a futile chase. Ironic cheers as he dives and slides over the ropes;
28.5;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run excellent full length, 90.5mph (145kph). Dug out and driven back down the pitch;
28.4;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run big cheers from the crowd as Lee takes a catch high above his head, but it's a bump ball;
28.3;1;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 run just back of a length, nurdled wide of gully, who stops well with a dive to his left, but the call is quick and the running is decisive;
28.2;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run tighter and fuller. Defended with a straight bat and a loud "no!";
28.2;1w;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 wide Collingwood steps across early, and Lee adjusts but too dramatically. That one is flung outside the tramlines on the off side;
28.1;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run full length and tailing in a fraction. Well dug out and pushed to midwicket;
27.6;4b;Hogg to Flintoff, 4 byes googly! And everyone is foxed. Flintoff is beaten, so is Gilchrist and so is Hayden at slip! A bonus for England, but well bowled by Hogg;
27.5;?;Hogg to Flintoff, no run a big shout as Flintoff is stuck on the pad, but clearly going over;
27.4;?;Hogg to Flintoff, no run big stride this time, but the same result. Measured defence;

26.5;1;Lee to PD Collingwood, 1 run pushed out to cover this time. More running for Collingwood. He's been hard worked in the past week;
26.4;2;Lee to PD Collingwood, 2 runs good running, nudged into the leg side. Hodge had a good distance to run in from deep square, and Collingwood was easily home;
26.3;4;Lee to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs thwacked, and effectively so! A fraction short of a length, and Collingwood was onto it in a flash, pulling emphatically through square leg!;
26.2;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run fuller and faster, up to 90.3mph (145kph). Defended;
26.1;1;Lee to Flintoff, 1 run shorter, and Flintoff is up on his toes, cutting that out to deep cover;

25.4;W;Hogg to PD Collingwood, OUT block and run into the off side, Hussey sprints in, picks up, twists and throws down the stumps at the striker's end and Bell is well short. Australia's fielding coach gives it out and the third umpire agrees. Great fielding but again a sniff of indecision in the calling;Ian Bell run out (Hussey) 26 (84m 45b 1x4 0x6) SR: 57.77;
25.3;1;Hogg to Bell, 1 run turned with the spin to long leg;

25.1;2;Hogg to Bell, 2 runs full and very wide, heaved to long-on;
24.6;?;Hussey to PD Collingwood, no run flicked to midwicket;
24.6;1w;Hussey to PD Collingwood, 1 wide wide outside off stump, again Gilchrist takes the bails off as if that might give some protection against the umpire signalling;
24.5;?;Hussey to PD Collingwood, no run pushed into the covers;
24.4;?;Hussey to PD Collingwood, no run driven to mid-off;
24.3;1;Hussey to Bell, 1 run cracking drive beats mid-off's dive but there's others around to tidy up;

23.2;1;Lee to Bell, 1 run pushed to point and again a moment of hesitation from Bell before he set off;
23.1;?;Lee to Bell, no run Bell pulls his bat inside the line of a ball three or four inches outside off;
22.6;3;Watson to Bell, 3 runs driven through extra cover, Hayden had plenty of ground to cover from sweeper, a good throw and Bell has to stretch to make the third;
22.5;2;Watson to Bell, 2 runs leg side, turned fine, good running to come back for the second as Bell spotted that Bracken had to run round the ball to pick it up;
22.4;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run checked drive to mid-on who is too deep to save the one;
22.3;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run tries to flick the ball into space on the leg but finds short midwicket;

22.1;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood right behind that, defended back to the bowler;
21.6;?;Bracken to Bell, no run left alone outside the off stump;
21.5;2;Bracken to Bell, 2 runs pulled between midwicket and mid-on, Hayden chases, dives but is left clutching at air ... McGrath round from deep midwicket to mop up;
21.4;?;Bracken to Bell, no run cut firmly to point where Clarke makes fielding look easy;
21.3;?;Bracken to Bell, no run Bell left that but it again picked up some pace off the wicket and Gilchrist took that on the rise;
21.2;3;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 3 runs Collingwood takes a big stride to meet the ball and whips it through midwicket. McGrath gives chase and catches up with it a couple of yards inside the boundary;
21.1;1;Bracken to Bell, 1 run steered along to ground to third man;
20.6;1;Watson to Bell, 1 run played a few yards into the off side, enough taken off the ball to allow a quick single as point sprinted in;
20.5;?;Watson to Bell, no run good ball, just short of a length and Bell sparred at that;
20.4;1;Watson to PD Collingwood, 1 run slower ball, full length, clipped to deep midwicket;
20.3;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run again driven and not timed, the ball bobbles to mid-off;
20.2;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run slightly wishy-washy drive, inside edge into his pads and the ball dobbles back to the bowler;

19.6;1;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run punched to mid-off, Hussey picks up and throws down the stumps at the non-striker's end ...the crowd gets excited, the fielders don't and the replay shows Collingwood was well in;
19.5;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run similar ball, again Collingwood not tempted;
19.4;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run speared across the right hander and he leaves it;
19.3;W;Bracken to Strauss, OUT loose drive outside off stump, minimal footwork and Gilchrist holds an edge at chest height to his left. A good delivery which seemed to pick up some zip off the pitch;Andrew Strauss c ?Gilchrist b Bracken 6 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 120;
19.2;?;Bracken to Strauss, no run good length on off stump, defended into the covers;

18.6;4;Watson to Strauss, 4 runs firm drive to mid-on who should have done better, he dived over the ball and it pulled up a yard inside the boundary;
18.5;2;Watson to Strauss, 2 runs flicked to midwicket where a misfield and allows Strauss to get off the mark;
18.4;?;Watson to Strauss, no run Strauss back and defends;
18.3;W;Watson to Bell, OUT Mal Loye is run out. Bell steered it straight to backward point where Hayden picked the ball up and threw down the stumps at the striker's end ... Loye was not in the picture and even had Hayden missed Gilchrist would have had time to complete the run out. The calling was indecisive and the stop-start running calamitous;Mal Loye run out (Hayden) 45 (85m 61b 8x4 1x6) SR: 73.77;
18.2;?;Watson to Bell, no run good response from Watson. Better length, and Bell's best attacking stroke can't beat the covers;
18.1;?;Watson to Bell, no run good shot for no runs. Bell opened his shoulders and flailed that down the ground. Mid-off intercepted;
17.6;?;Bracken to Loye, no run good finish, but that's another productive over for England and Loye, who is advancing towards his first ODI fifty;
17.5;?;Bracken to Loye, no run advances down the pitch in a statement of intent, but played defensively at the last minute;
17.4;4;Bracken to Loye, FOUR runs there was room that time! Away he goes again, and that's four more through square leg! It's a sweepathon at the SCG!;
17.3;?;Bracken to Loye, no run good line and length, no room for Loye to swing his arms as yet. Pushed out to point;
17.2;?;Bracken to Loye, no run Loye was contemplating the sweep-slog again, but backed out at the last minute and drove into the covers instead;
17.1;?;Bracken to Loye, no run good start from Bracken. Pitches middle-and-leg, angled across the right hander, Loye, who offers no shot. 82.5mph (133kph);
16.6;1;McGrath to Loye, 1 run straighter this time, and prodded out to point. Good resumption from England;
16.5;6;McGrath to Loye, SIX runs thwack! There's Loye's signature shot, and it's flown all the way over backward square for a maximum! Fetched from outside off on one knee, and wonderfully timed!;
16.4;?;McGrath to Loye, no run big scythe of the bat outside off stump, but can't bisect the cover fielders;
16.3;?;McGrath to Loye, no run perfect line and length this time. Pushed respectfully back up the pitch;
16.2;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run good nudge off the hips from Bell, but England miss out on a second run as Hodge misfields at square leg. Neither batsman noticed ...;
16.1;1lb;McGrath to Loye, 1 leg bye angled into the pads, Loye sizes up a flick off one leg, but can't get bat on it. Bobbles into space behind square nonetheless;
15.6;1;Watson to Loye, 1 run more slog-sweeping! That would have been a massive wide, but Loye fetched it from way outside off stump, and toe-ended it over midwicket;
15.5;?;Watson to Loye, no run driving once again, can't beat the field;
15.4;?;Watson to Loye, no run down on one knee to slog-sweep, and that's a nice strike, but straight to square leg. Good thinking but misses out;
15.3;4;Watson to Loye, FOUR runs far too much width, and Loye goes down on one knee to slap fiercely past point! Top strike!;
15.2;?;Watson to Loye, no run tighter and fuller, and Loye drives out to the covers;
15.2;1w;Watson to Loye, 1 wide a fraction harsh there, but Loye offered no shot so the umpire made the call;
15.1;1;Watson to Bell, 1 run handsome drive to get things back underway. Tidy field and shy from mid-off;
14.6;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run lovely over, right on the spot each time. This ball is pushed away off the front foot;
14.5;?;McGrath to Bell, no run classy drive, but not timed;
14.4;?;McGrath to Bell, no run good length and good bounce again. Gully tidies up;
14.3;?;McGrath to Bell, no run extra bounce from a good length, and Bell fends that uncomfortably to gully. All along the ground though;
14.2;?;McGrath to Bell, no run another fine take from Gilchrist as Bell aims a flashy drive but misses;
14.1;?;McGrath to Bell, no run lovely ball. Slapped into Gilchrist's gloves, waiting as they were over the top of off stump;
13.6;4;Watson to Loye, FOUR runs two in two balls! A touch more orthodox this time, but the same result. Watson just losing his length at the end of that over, and he lacks the pace to get away with it on this slight pudding of a pitch;
13.5;4;Watson to Loye, FOUR runs short and spanked! That fizzed over midwicket! When he hits it, it does stay hit ...;
13.4;?;Watson to Loye, no run outside off again, but a tighter line and again no shot;
13.4;1w;Watson to Loye, 1 wide way outside off stump and swinging further away;
13.3;?;Watson to Loye, no run full bunger, and Loye misses out as he slaps this one to cover;
13.2;?;Watson to Loye, no run attacking intent from Loye, who stands tall to smear that into the covers, but it's not timed;
13.1;?;Watson to Loye, no run good first delivery. Decent pace, hint of outswing, left alone by Loye;
12.6;?;McGrath to Bell, no run angled into the pads, but worked no further than short midwicket. Another economical over for Australia;
12.5;?;McGrath to Bell, no run back on a better length, but McGrath's still muttering to himself about that last ball;
12.4;4;McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs that's a great strike from Bell! Pitched on middle-and-leg and just a bit too full, and caressed firmly through long-on!;
12.3;?;McGrath to Bell, no run steady stuff once again from McGrath. Keeper's standing up, and Bell is cagily forward to defend;
12.2;?;McGrath to Bell, no run a fraction short, but Bell can't get his swivel-pull away;
12.1;?;McGrath to Bell, no run excellent work from Clarke at point. Bell drives square off the back foot, but the call of "wait" is amply justified as the ball is intercepted one-handed at full stretch to Clarke's left;
11.6;?;Lee to Loye, no run good finish to the over, good line, good length, Loye comes forward and drives out to cover;
11.5;?;Lee to Loye, no run better length, slightly wide of off stump, but then that's the line that has done for Loye this series;
11.4;4;Lee to Loye, FOUR runs good strike, up and over midwicket for a rare boundary. That was banged in too short, and sits up nicely for Loye to slap out of sight.;
11.4;1nb;Lee to Loye, (no ball) drawn forward in a tight defence. Played into the covers. Steady stuff from the Aussies;
11.3;1;Lee to Bell, 1 run width, and worked down to third man, where McGrath fields to loud and not entirely ironic cheers;
11.2;?;Lee to Bell, no run pushed back onto his stumps this time, but same result. Tight bowling, as the run-rate slips below 3.5 an over;
11.1;?;Lee to Bell, no run drawn onto the front foot, defended to short cover;
10.6;?;McGrath to Loye, no run excellent over, just one run from it, as this one fizzes past off stump with no stroke offered;
10.5;?;McGrath to Loye, no run tighter to the stumps, and defended solidly back down the pitch;
10.4;?;McGrath to Loye, no run a flashier stroke from Loye, but still no width to work with, cover tidies up;
10.3;?;McGrath to Loye, no run perfect line and length from McGrath - he's a bowler reborn after his horror story at Melbourne. So far;
10.2;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run hint of width this time and some extra bounce too - a late deflection down to third man;
10.1;?;McGrath to Bell, no run right on the money with Adam Gilchrist standing up to the stumps. Defended into the covers;
9.6;?;Lee to Loye, no run firm front-foot drive to mid-off;
9.5;?;Lee to Loye, no run speared in outside off at 92.8mph/149.5kph, all all done so with a loud grunt;
9.4;?;Lee to Loye, no run right up there, virtual yorker length, and squeezed into the leg side;
9.3;?;Lee to Loye, no run played into the covers, this time with no alarms;
9.2;?;Lee to Loye, no run patted with no force to Hogg at deepish cover, Bell had come for a run and would have been well out at the bowler's end had the shy at the stumps hit;
9.1;2;Lee to Loye, 2 runs full and wide, driven uppishly past a diving short extra cover, a good chase and relay field;
8.6;?;McGrath to Bell, no run Bell tries to play a Loyesque heave through midwicket and misses;
8.5;2;McGrath to Bell, 2 runs a little too wide and cut through backward point, third man had some distance to go to his right and that allowed the second;
8.4;?;McGrath to Bell, no run Bell into line and pats the ball back;
8.3;?;McGrath to Bell, no run outside off and left, that one had some zing in it;
8.2;?;McGrath to Bell, no run Bell takes a big step forward to meet the ball and blocks;
8.1;W;McGrath to Joyce, OUT short, Joyce looked to pull but didn't time it, didn't commit to hitting over the infield and Brad Hodge takes a really good catch with a full-length dive to his left at midwicket;Ed Joyce c Hodge b McGrath 15 (37m 27b 3x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;

7.4;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run patted into the off side;
7.3;4;Bracken to Joyce, FOUR runs Bracken's excellent line wavers, he bowls short and Joyce thumps it through wide midwicket. With seven men on the off, Bracken can't drop it short;
7.2;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run Joyce shuffles across and jabs at that one, it kept low and he missed it, even if he had edged it wouldn't have carried;
7.1;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run Joyce leaves one short of a length outside off;
6.6;4;McGrath to Loye, FOUR runs super shot, Loye climbs on his toes and punches the ball off the back foot through the covers.;
6.5;?;McGrath to Loye, no run first-rate yorker which Loye digs out;
6.4;2;McGrath to Loye, 2 runs short and an unconvincing and not timed pull, the ball positively puffs through midwicket;
6.3;?;McGrath to Loye, no run nice length, not letting Loye get forward. This one is patted to extra cover;
6.2;?;McGrath to Loye, no run Loye again takes a step across his stumps and pushes it to midwicket. he looked slightly off balance with both those shots;
6.1;?;McGrath to Loye, no run Loye back and across to block ... 82mph/132kph;
5.6;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run jabbed towards backward point and Clarke sprints in like an enthusiastic puppy;
5.5;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run tighter line, Joyce back and punches the ball down and into the covers;
5.4;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run almost a replay of the second ball, Joyce leaves outside off stump;
5.3;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run Joyce plays defensively into the off side;
5.2;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run same line, with a bit more bounce, and again Joyce pulls inside the ball;
5.1;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run Joyce leaves one outside off;
4.6;?;Lee to Loye, no run driven, but off balance and the ball scoots to mid-on rather than through the off side;
4.6;1nb;Lee to Loye, (no ball) another attempted sweep which Loye again misses but Lee oversteps by some way;
4.5;4;Lee to Loye, FOUR runs much better shot and a real confidence booster, full and wide and driven along the ground between cover and extra cover;
4.4;?;Lee to Loye, no run Loye goes forward to defend, a little more bounce and it raps him on the bottom hand and trickles into the leg side;
4.4;1nb;Lee to Loye, (no ball) outside off, too wide to tempt Loye but wide enough for the umpire to signal it;
4.3;?;Lee to Loye, no run outside off at 92.8mph (149.5kph) and Loye leaves it;
4.2;?;Lee to Loye, no run a massive swing as he tries to sweep Lee, misses by some way. You can almost hear Chappell teeing off ...;
4.1;?;Lee to Loye, no run full outside off stump, a really loose drive that ends up bobbling towards the slips;
3.6;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run short of a length, Joyce plays defensively into the covers;
3.5;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run Joyce moves forward early, it's outside off and he leaves;
3.4;1;Bracken to Loye, 1 run Loye stands upright and stays back, choosing to play it late as he opens the face and runs the ball to third man;
3.3;?;Bracken to Loye, no run angled across the right hander and Loye not at all interested;
3.2;?;Bracken to Loye, no run fuller and a good line, pushed back up the pitch;
3.1;4;Bracken to Loye, FOUR runs banged it and thumped with real oomph through midwicket. It went like a tracer bullet. That one was for Chappelli;
2.6;?;Lee to Joyce, no run defensive push to point;
2.5;4;Lee to Joyce, FOUR runs long hop, pulled convincingly in front of square on the leg, four all the way;
2.5;1nb;Lee to Joyce, (no ball) short, too quick for Joyce (93mph/150kph) and it's through him by the time he plays at it.;
2.4;?;Lee to Joyce, no run Joyce again has to use his height to get over that and the ball trundles towards extra cover;
2.3;?;Lee to Joyce, no run Joyce forward and pushes to point;
2.2;?;Lee to Joyce, no run short, Joyce up on his toes and steers the ball to backward point where Clarke makes a diving stop to his right;
2.1;?;Lee to Joyce, no run slanted across the left hander, Joyce shoulders arms;
1.6;?;Bracken to Loye, no run Loye takes a big step forward, gets a thick inside edge onto his pad and it loops into space on the leg. A hint of inswing there;
1.5;?;Bracken to Loye, no run short again but also down the leg, off Loye's thigh pad and Gilchrist has to move with a little more speed to take it;
1.4;?;Bracken to Loye, no run leg side, off Loye's pads and it bobbles very fine to Gilchrist who takes two steps across to gather;
1.3;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run wide again, and this wasn't timed and it bobbles out into the covers;
1.2;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run turned to midwicket;
1.1;4;Bracken to Joyce, FOUR runs loose, started wide and swung wider, Joyce punches that through the covers. he didn't look to have timed it at all but the ball keeps trundling and although Hussey dives and pulls it back, it had already hit the boundary marker;
0.6;?;Lee to Loye, no run outside off stump at 93mph (150kph) and left alone;
0.5;?;Lee to Loye, no run Loye shapes to play a heave/sweep to a ball fractionally short outside off stump and gets hit in the body. Lee follows through to give him some advice, Loye shrugs;
0.4;?;Lee to Loye, no run Loye jabs down a little late, into the covers and a firm call of "no" from both ends;
0.4;1w;Lee to Loye, 1 wide wider and left alone (92mph, 148kph). Not to the umpire's liking, a bit of a harsh call;
0.3;?;Lee to Loye, no run short of a length outside off, a very loose and unconvincing swish from a man who needs a score to cement a World Cup berth;
0.2;1;Lee to Joyce, 1 run pushed gently into the leg side, Lee springs across to field and ends up in a heap as he tries to tumble and throw, all very undignified;
0.1;?;Lee to Joyce, no run good start, on middle, flicked into the leg side, a lose throw to the keeper and all very messy as fielders dive to save overthrows;

2.15pm Everyone's in the middle, we've had the huddles and all that, so here we go ... It's Brett Lee to Ed Joyce ...
2.05pm England have won the toss and will bat. Both sides are unchanged and despite forecasts of poor weather, the sun is shining and we are set for a prompt start. There is a lot of rain to the south, however, so fingers crossed.
Andrew Flintoff: "I'm pleased as the wicket did more second half under lights. They'll be keen to put the record straight and we'll have to play well to keep them down."
Ricky Ponting: "I'd like to have won the toss.The way is to get out there and bat first. It might get slower as the game goes on. The ball might swing around a bit this afternoon."
England 1 Ed Joyce, 2 Mal Loye, 3 Ian Bell, 4 Andrew Strauss, 5 Paul Collingwood, 6 Andrew Flintoff (capt), 7 Jamie Dalrymple, 8 Paul Nixon (wk), 9 Liam Plunkett, 10 Sajid Mahmood, 11 Monty Panesar.

1.20pm Good afternoon and welcome to our coverage of the second CB Series final. England have named an unchanged side, Australian news when we get it ...
12.00pm Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's live ball-by-ball coverage of the second final of the CB Series between Australia and England at Sydney. Well, well, what have we got ourselves here? A bit of a contest, that's what. After three months of abject capitulations at the hands of the Australians, England's cricketers have finally found some fight. On Friday, they won a thrilling match at Melbourne by four wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the best-of-three finals, and another victory tonight would snatch their first trophy on Australian soil for a full 20 years. Join us at 3.15am GMT for all the action.
 Innings Start
Well, that's the end of a long series and for Australia a defeat which is not the end of the world but which does raise some questions so soon before the World Cup. And a sad home farewell for Glenn McGrath, and a losing one also for John Buchanan.
England have not become world-beaters overnight, but they will be confident heading to the Caribbean. A fortnight ago they were a shambles, now they look a unit.
Australia now head to New Zealand for three more ODIs starting next Friday in the Chappell-Hadlee series, games which are now more important than they were a week ago. If they lose that series then concerns will continue to grow.
From me, Martin Williamson, and from my fellow commentators Andrew Miller, Jenny Thompson, Will Luke and Andrew McGlashan, thank you for staying with us through the summer and for your kind comments. We are off to have a rest and will be back for the World Cup in a month's time.
Presentations These are, to quote Mark Taylor, in the "bowels of the Bradman Stand". Surely they are not in hiding?!
Player of the Finals Paul Collingwood. "Australia taught us a lesson in the Tests but it's good to end on a high."
Player of the Series Ricky Ponting.
Andrew Flintoff clutches an uber cheque ... makes the usual platitudes. "The lads in the dressing-room are cock-a-hoop. It's been a tough trip but to take something home is a great thrill. The past four games are as good as I've seen an England one-day side play. I'd like to thank Duncan Fletcher. he's taken knocks and it's nice to pay something back to him."
10.50pm England's dressing erupts into celebration as the announcement comes through confirming that they have won this match by 34 runs and with it the CB Series 2-0.
10.45pm The Barmy Army are singing in the rain but there is now a report that the umpires are saying there are 10 minutes to go before the game can be called off! Utter confusion and a PA announcement would be nice.
10.42pm It's got heavier ... I suspect that is it. England are not celebrating yet but the grins are unmistakable.
10.41pm Still raining, covers are on and the stands are emptying fast.
10.39pm This is bad for Australia. They should be 187 to win the game if it ends now. And if they are not playing in six minutes time (10.45pm/1145GMT) then it's all over. The countdown begins ...
It's raining again and the umpires are consulting ... the crowd boo and all that happens is that the ball is changed. Liam Plunkett into the attack for his last over. Loud boos around the ground as the umpires take the players off as it gets heavier.

13.3;1;Flintoff to Watson, 1 run Watson goes to leave alone but is slow pulling the bat out of the way and the ball clips it and shoots through the slips;
13.2;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run outside off stump, theatrical leave from Watson;
13.1;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run Watson back and across to defend;
12.6;3;Mahmood to Watson, 3 runs slower ball, a fraction off line, and that's a firm clip into space beyond midwicket.;
12.5;?;Mahmood to Watson, no run good stuff again. Extra bounce this time outside off, and Nixon takes high above his head;
12.4;?;Mahmood to Watson, no run well bowled, tight on off stump, Watson has to shoulder arms;
12.3;?;Mahmood to Watson, no run full length again, turned to midwicket;
12.2;1;Mahmood to Hodge, 1 run back of a length, Hodge goes back and picks the gap on the off side;
12.1;?;Mahmood to Hodge, no run forward, and driven into the covers;
11.6;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run fuller length again, and Watson can only defend to complete a wicket maiden!;
11.5;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run bouncer! And Watson was taken completely by surprise! The ball exploded off his glove and flew into the leg side;
11.4;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run a bit of excitement as Watson is squared up;
11.3;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run right on the money again from Flintoff. He's been colossal in the last week;
11.2;W;Flintoff to Hussey, OUT That's massive! A fraction wider, Hussey - who had played no shot at his last six balls from Flintoff - took a big swish, and Strauss at a lone slip made no mistake whatsoever!;Michael Hussey c Strauss b Flintoff 0 (18m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
11.1;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run right in the channel again. Hussey watches it sail by;

10.5;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run better line and length. Back outside off stump, and left alone;

10.3;4;Plunkett to Hodge, FOUR runs wonderful shot. Over-pitched this time, and that's clobbered through the covers. Good counterattack;
10.2;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run pitch it up he did, and a big appeal! Very adjacent, but a big inside-edge. Better bowling though;
10.1;4;Plunkett to Hodge, FOUR runs short and Hodge stands tall once again to ping that through midwicket. Carbon-copy of his previous boundary!;
9.6;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run excellent over. Tight and accurate, Hussey content to let it all fly by;

9.1;1;Flintoff to Hodge, 1 run clipped down to third man;
8.6;?;Plunkett to Hussey, no run short of a length. Too short to tempt a strike, but full enough for Hussey to leave alone;
8.5;?;Plunkett to Hussey, no run fuller and straighter. Defended to point with a loud "no!";
8.4;?;Plunkett to Hussey, no run short of a length and angled across the left-hander. Hussey opts to leave alone as Nixon fields with a dive towards the slips;
8.3;5;Plunkett to Hodge, 5 runs clipped into the leg side - could have been a close call on the run-out, but Joyce's throw is rubbish. Well wide of the stumps and the fielder backing up. Mahmood can't cut off the overthrows;

8.1;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run middle-and-leg, shaping away, pushed to midwicket;

7.3;4;Mahmood to Hodge, FOUR runs banged in and wallop! Too short and Hodge stood tall to thwack that through square leg. Good batting;
7.2;?;Mahmood to Hodge, no run back and into line. More rain on the radar ...;
7.1;?;Mahmood to Hodge, no run solid defence. Good line and length from Mahmood;
6.6;W;Plunkett to Clarke, OUT GONE! What an over! On the spot again, hint of movement, Clarke went for the drive, Nixon pouched the edge, Australia are all over the shop on a rain-juiced wicket!;Michael Clarke c ?Nixon b Plunkett 0 (17m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
6.5;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run defended watchfully. It's all happening here!;
6.4;1;Plunkett to Hodge, 1 run dropped! That was another perfect delivery from Plunkett. Burst off the pitch with late outswing, took the shoulder, and Collingwood at second slip could only parry a salmon leap to his left!;
6.3;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run good bowling again. Outside off, hint of movement, left alone;
6.2;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run nice follow-up from Plunkett. Good length, late movement away from the right-hander. Defended;
6.1;W;Plunkett to Gilchrist, OUT massive start for England! Beautiful delivery from round the wicket, tailing in late, beating a loose drive from Gilchrist and clipping the top of off stump! Perfect resumption from Plunkett, do England have the CB Series trophy within their grasp?;Adam Gilchrist b Plunkett 20 (36m 17b 2x4 0x6) SR: 117.64;
6.1;1w;Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 wide another one down the leg side. These are a bit wasteful;
5.6;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run tidy finish to the over. Climbed off a good length at 91mph again, as Clarke shouldered arms;
5.5;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run width this time, and Clarke has a mow but misses - 147kph that time (91 mph);
5.4;1;Mahmood to Gilchrist, 1 run faster and shorter. Up beyond 80mph again and Gilchrist is late on his pull shot. A top-edge bounces down to fine leg;
5.3;?;Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run good full length, slower ball that time, and Gilchrist was a touch fooled as it looped down to off stump. Good bowling;
5.2;?;Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run pushed out to the covers off the front foot;
5.1;2;Mahmood to Gilchrist, 2 runs banged in on leg stump, Gilchrist hops across to fiddle out to midwicket;
4.6;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run wide outside off stump, but that one is allowed to go by. Successful over;
4.5;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run better length and Clarke comes forward in a solid defence;
4.5;1w;Plunkett to Clarke, 1 wide oh dear, that's a bit loose. Wide outside off. Needs to keep concentrating;
4.5;1nb;Plunkett to Clarke, (no ball) slight overstep, but good length again;
4.4;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run lovely ball. Fuller length and late nip off the seam. Climbs over the top of off stump as Clarke shoulders arms;
4.3;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run good start, full and swinging again. Clarke leaves alone;
4.2;W;Plunkett to Ponting, OUT GOT HIM! That's a massive breakthrough, and it's all credit to Plunkett there.

4.1;?;Plunkett to Ponting, no run he played at that one! Short of a length and climbed past the bat as Ponting went for the pull. He's pumped up;
4.1;1w;Plunkett to Ponting, 1 wide wide of off stump and that's a very harsh call. Swinging gently away to the slips but Ponting could have played it if he wished;
3.6;?;Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run another slower ball, a genuine edge as Gilchrist misread it but it falls a yard short of Flintoff at first slip;
3.5;1;Mahmood to Ponting, 1 run pushed into space in the covers;
3.4;2;Mahmood to Ponting, 2 runs short, Ponting onto it in a trice and he launches it over midwicket. It plugs in the soft turf and Joyce catches the ball a yard in side the rope;
3.3;?;Mahmood to Ponting, no run defended back to the bowler;
3.2;4;Mahmood to Ponting, FOUR runs well-timed on drive, Panesar at mid-on dives but it's all a bit slow and for show and he's never near it;
3.1;W;Mahmood to Hayden, OUT slower ball, Hayden falls into the trap and drills it into Collingwood at short extra cover and he holds a good low catch. He didn't have to move to the side but it was low and was travelling;Matthew Hayden c Collingwood b Mahmood 5 (16m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
2.6;4;Plunkett to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Gilchrist uses one of his lives ... he was looking to guide the ball to third man, it came back, he was completely cramped and it flew off the shoulder and over slip;
2.5;2;Plunkett to Gilchrist, 2 runs rather nonchalant/loose flip over point, high enough to be safe;
2.4;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run steered to Panesar at third man;
2.3;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run pushed to short extra cover who has come in about 12-15 yards from the bat on the drive;
2.2;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run Hayden shapes to turn to leg, misses, and is struck in the nether regions. He's hard ... not even a grimace;
2.2;2nb;Plunkett to Gilchrist, (no ball) 1 run flicked behind square on the leg, and a no-ball as well;
2.1;4;Plunkett to Gilchrist, FOUR runs lovely shot, too much width and he leaned into that and crashed it past extra cover who never had a chance;
1.6;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run decent ball, short and it seamed away from Gilchrist at 90mph (145kph);
1.5;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run bouncer which Gilchrist doesn't so much duck as nod at;
1.4;1;Mahmood to Gilchrist, 1 run steered into space in the off side,;

1.2;3;Mahmood to Hayden, 3 runs a fraction short, Hayden pulls off the front foot and off the toe of the bat as well;
1.1;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run loosener outside off stump, Hayden sniffily watches it pass;
0.6;?;Plunkett to Gilchrist, no run outside off stump, Gilchrist shapes to smack it through the covers but doesn't get hold of it and thumps it into the pitch and from there to Plunkett;
0.5;2;Plunkett to Gilchrist, 2 runs banged in, uncontrolled top-edged hook from Gilchrist which he gets away with as it goes very fine. Mahmood was wide at long leg and so never in the frame;
0.4;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run a yelp of frustration from Plunkett as Hayden jabs down late, the ball shoots into the leg side for an easy one;
0.3;3;Plunkett to Gilchrist, 3 runs too full and driven firmly past extra cover;
0.2;?;Plunkett to Gilchrist, no run Gilchrist blocks into the off side. More swing for Plunkett;
0.1;?;Plunkett to Gilchrist, no run a better line, fullish and blocked to mid-off;
0.1;1w;Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 wide and another leg-side wide ... it is swinging into the left hander but Plunkett's radar is well off;
0.1;1w;Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 wide poor start, a wide well down the leg side;

Sajid Mahmood to share the new ball. He too can be wayward ... will he find the spot from the off?
