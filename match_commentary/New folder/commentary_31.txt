5.40pm Back for the chase, not long from now. KL Rahul has the wicketkeeping pads on. That's an interesting update. India will look for quick wickets, and I also think scoring becomes a bit tougher on this pitch once the ball softens a bit. Lots to play for just yet
We're at the start of a new decade, but the ISL remains as dramatic as ever, with mini-brawls, sackings, fiery tweets and of course, a certain player from Bengaluru FC doing what he does best.
5.15pm A decent start followed by a middle-overs collapse before a brief rescue act by the lower order. Dhawan top-scored with 74 but India were all out for 255 in 49.1 overs. Starc picked up 3 for 56, and bowled eight yorkers in the game. He has never bowled that many in an ODI, Bharath tells me. Starc reckons the dew may make the ball come easier onto the bat in the second innings. We will be back with the chase soon, stay tuned.

38.6;2;Cummins to Jadeja, 2 runs short of length outside off, dabs it towards the left of the third man, and he is sprinting back for the second. A direct hit and they are checking upstairs. Richardson is the fielder but Jadeja was dragging his bat and was well inside;

32.5;W;Starc to Iyer, OUT and the move to bring Starc back has worked. Don't think it was a special delivery though, a length ball angling away, Iyer pushes away from the body and gets an outside edge, a simple catch for Carey behind the stumps;Shreyas Iyer c ?Carey b Starc 4 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 44.44;
32.4;1;Starc to Pant, 1 run length ball at the stumps, flicked towards backward square leg;

31.2;W;Zampa to Kohli, OUT he's gotten his revenge! Kohli falls to Zampa again! Driven hard, to a ball that was floated around off, and he just couldn't keep it away from Zampa, who takes a sharp chance and then punches the air. Important breakthrough for Australia at this stage, as it exposes the relatively soft underbelly of the Indian batting, with a good way to cover in this innings;Virat Kohli c & b Zampa 16 (14b 0x4 1x6) SR: 114.28;
31.1;6;Zampa to Kohli, SIX runs very short ball, and gets the right treatment! Rocks back, and swings this over the long leg fence. Just went over, in the end, but good enough to fetch half a dozen;
30.6;?;Cummins to Iyer, no run short, well-directed, and he weaves away to avoid this one;
30.5;1;Cummins to Kohli, 1 run length, just runs off the outside edge as Kohli has a nibble at it. Evades slip, and goes along the ground down to third man;

28.6;1;Cummins to Kohli, 1 run reaches out to a length ball around off, and runs it down towards third man;
28.5;W;Cummins to S Dhawan, OUT Dhawan goes! Must have been a change of pace, because Dhawan got that nowhere near where he wanted to play it. Just looks to flick it away, and the outside edge carries it towards cover. Ashton Agar runs in from mid-off and takes a good, diving catch away to his right. The set man is gone, as the bowling change makes a difference immediately for Finch!;Shikhar Dhawan c Agar b Cummins 74 (91b 9x4 1x6) SR: 81.31;
28.4;1;Cummins to Kohli, 1 run length, and he drives this towards sweeper cover;

27.5;?;Agar to Kohli, no run length, and he stretches to drive towards cover;

27.3;?;Agar to S Dhawan, no run length, down the leg side, and he sweeps, and again plays it straight to short fine-leg;
27.2;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run drives hard towards long-off, with a good forward stride in towards the ball;
27.1;W;Agar to Rahul, OUT GONE! Chips a length ball in the air, just doesn't get to the pitch of one floated around off. Perhaps gripped a bit on the pitch too, and he just drives this straight to Steve Smith at cover. Loud cheers, as the crowd prepare for Virat Kohli;KL Rahul c Smith b Agar 47 (61b 4x4 0x6) SR: 77.04;

26.3;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run length, punched towards deep point;
26.2;1;Kane Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 run short, scrambled-seam from the look of things, and he plays it towards point. A slight misfield, and the ball does go wide enough to allow a run to be pinched;
26.1;1;Kane Richardson to Rahul, 1 run fuller length, and he plays a gorgeous drive, just to the left of mid-off. Cummins fields and has a shy at the non-striker's end. Just misses, though Rahul was well in;
25.6;1;Zampa to Rahul, 1 run length, driven out towards sweeper cover;
25.5;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run this is interesting. The ball goes through Rahul, looks to have taken a little tickle, and then Carey comes up with a good take. Australia appeal but the umpires refer this to television. The soft signal is not out! It bounces on its way through to Carey. Shall stay not out;
25.4;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run length, driven back towards the bowler;
25.3;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run shorter, and he goes back and drives it back towards the bowler;

 Innings Start
8.49pm Well, that spanking out of the way, let's look ahead to the second ODI, which now provides Finch and his men a chance to wrap this series up in just two games. It's goodbye for now, from Chandan Duorah, Hemant Brar, and myself, Debayan Sen. We'll see you in Rajkot on January 17 to see if India can bounce back and keep this series alive.
8.37pm The presentation is coming up next. David Warner is the Man of the Match. Tells Sanjay Manjrekar on the broadcast: "(On coming back after the ban) I think I've always had the hunger and desire for runs. It's just a great effort from our fast bowlers to knock India over for 255. We wanted to just protect the Powerplay. We got off to a flier, and we were very clinical in the end. For us, it's about keeping rotating the strike and taking the odd boundary here and there. it's about taking the game deep. We knew if we were there at the end, we would win. (On fitness) For me, it's about putting in a 100 percent all the time. As a kid, I loved fielding and diving around. I work hard on my fitness, and we've got a great S&C (strength and conditioning) and my wife also has had a role in making sure that I keep up with it."
Virat Kohli: "Totally outplayed in all three departments. It's a very strong Australian team, and if you don't play well enough, they will hurt you. In phases, we were too respectful against their bowlers, and didn't take the game by the scruff of the neck. It's another challenge to bounce back from here. (On T20 plans) International cricket is always priceless. Experience in any format helps you in other formats. It's about being out there and playing good international cricket. It's an opportunity for these young middle order players to stand up to outstanding bowlers and play a match-winning knock. (On batting at 4) We've had this discussion in the past. Because of the way KL has batted, we have tried to have him bat up in the lineup. We might have to think about this. Every now and then, it's about putting people up there and testing them. People need to relax and not panic. Today was one of the days it didn't come off."
Aaron Finch: "I thought the way we fought back in the middle overs with the ball had a huge part today. The way KL and Shikhar were batting, they could have gone to a much bigger score. Proud of how we fought back. I think we could still brush up in the field. The outfield is a bit damp. Any time you beat India in India is a special feeling. (On Warner) It's been fantastic. He's been unstoppable for a long time now. I think this is his 18th ODI ton and 10th in the last 2-3 years. India will bounce back. They have a couple of all-time greats, and we have to be right on top of our game."
RaoP: "What did you think of Marnus' debut? Did he look good with his pads on through out the Australian innings?" --- Terrific stance. Not easy to keep your bat straight when you have to sit for two and a half hours at one place.
Vinay: "India have lost 4 matches in a row against Australia when Dhoni hasn't been part of the team. " --- Flashback to the 2019 series?
This is just the third time in ODI history, that a team has won a match by 10 wickets when chasing 250 or more. Interestingly, the teams to suffer each time have all been Asian ones!
Dez: "Toothless bowling from India! Got some work to do if they want to challenge for wt20 knockouts. Aus, Eng, NZ and WI ahead of them at the moment. "
McEnroe : "Finch for Man of the Match. Good batting and good captaining. " --- Plenty of players to choose from. I thought Starc and Cummins were outstanding too. But yes, Finch was the one who set the chase in motion with some glorious cover drives
8.25pm Well, we all would have been prepared to stay on for another hour at the very least, weren't we? Australia have won this in a canter. Everything they did today was perfect. The planning, the field placements, the bowling, the fielding. All of it topped off with a muscular opening partnership that made a mockery of the chase. Someone on feedback said India were 130 short, but in this form, these two might have brought those runs up in the 12-odd overs that remained!

6.5;4;Bumrah to Finch, FOUR runs length, and he goes on top of the bounce and plays this towards point. Beats the man at point, Jadeja, diving away to his left, and then races away to the right of third man. Terrific shot again from Finch!;
6.4;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length, punched towards cover;
6.3;1;Bumrah to Warner, 1 run length, jags back into him, and he whips this away towards square leg;
6.2;4;Bumrah to Warner, FOUR runs short, and he flicks this away towards deep backward square leg;
6.1;?;Bumrah to Warner, no run length, and he flicks this towards short mid-wicket;
5.6;?;Thakur to Finch, no run length, swing away, and he drives to cover;
5.5;2;Thakur to Finch, 2 runs length, movement away, and he drives. There's a wobble at cover by Manish Pandey, and that allows Finch to pick up runs;
5.4;1;Thakur to Warner, 1 run length, zips in from outside off, and he flicks it with the movement towards fine leg;
5.4;1w;Thakur to Warner, 1 wide short, down the leg side, and he chases it, and he's been given out caught behind! Warner reviews after a lengthy chat with Finch. This was a terrible ball actually, and deserved the proper treatment it nearly received from the batsman. Did he just get a feather on it, through to Rahul behind the wicket? No. Nothing on that on the broadcast. Warner stays;
5.3;?;Thakur to Warner, no run fuller ball, a hint of movement back in, and Warner drives this towards point;
5.2;?;Thakur to Warner, no run length, and he presses forward to defend this;
5.1;?;Thakur to Warner, no run gets the very first ball to jag back from around the wicket. Strikes Warner as he misses that. Was it missing leg, or perhaps too high? Eventually, there's no review from India;
4.6;3;Shami to Warner, 3 runs length, and he flicks it off his pads towards mid-wicket. There's a fielder there, Shikhar Dhawan, who misfields. Has to chase this all the way to the fence, and he's able to pull it back just in time to prevent four;
4.5;?;Shami to Warner, no run length, angles back into him, and he defends this towards cover;
4.4;?;Shami to Warner, no run length, driven back towards Shami, who picks it up on his follow-through;
4.3;1lb;Shami to Finch, 1 leg bye length, jags back in, and he looks to play this towards the on side. Off the pads, and going down leg, but drops towards square leg;
4.2;4;Shami to Finch, FOUR runs length, around off, and he drives this between cover-point and point. Superb shot, with no chance for either fielder to get anywhere near it!;
4.1;?;Shami to Finch, no run length, just around off, and he drives this back towards cover;
3.6;1lb;Bumrah to Finch, 1 leg bye length, and he whips this towards fine leg. Off the pad, says the umpire;
3.5;4;Bumrah to Finch, FOUR runs short, and he hangs back and punches this through point;
3.4;2;Bumrah to Finch, 2 runs hint of movement back in, and he uses that to nurdle this towards deep backward square leg. Hard running brings an easy two;
3.3;4;Bumrah to Finch, FOUR runs gorgeous! The length is good, but not as full as what you would consider ideal for the drive. There's a bit of movement back in, and with that Finch just throws his hands at it and strokes it through cover;
3.2;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run shorter, a bit of shape back in, and he cuts this towards point;
3.1;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length, around off, and he drives this towards point;
2.6;?;Shami to Warner, no run ooh, a beauty! Like a very fast off-break, this pitches around off, and then moves away in the air. Warner half-stretches forward to defend, and sees this whizz past his outside edge, through to KL Rahul behind the stumps. Remember again, no Pant;
2.5;?;Shami to Warner, no run length, nips back in a touch, and he defends from the crease;
2.4;?;Shami to Warner, no run full, wide, and he smashes this hard through cover, but the fielder there is quick to cut this off;
2.3;1;Shami to Finch, 1 run strays down the pads with a fuller ball, and he can flick it away towards long leg;
2.2;4;Shami to Finch, FOUR runs inswinger, but he stretches and smashes this through covers. Top shot from Finch! A short movement forward with his front foot, and then just going with the shot as he would normally do. It's been a mode of dismissal exploited by India in the past, but not this time;
2.1;1;Shami to Warner, 1 run strays down the pads, and he can whip it off his legs towards long leg. Wants two, but has to settle for one as the fielder converges quickly from fine leg;
1.6;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length, a hint of movement back in. Finch wants to press forward to defend, and the inward movement makes the bat skew as he blocks;
1.5;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length, jags back in from outside off, and Finch leaves it. Trusts the bounce on this surface, but that wasn't far away from the top of off!;
1.4;2;Bumrah to Finch, 2 runs shorter, and he goes on top of his toes to ride the bounce. Pushes this through the cover-point region, and picks up two before Pandey can pull it back in;
1.3;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length, and he defends this incoming ball towards point;
1.2;1lb;Bumrah to Warner, 1 leg bye shorter, and he looks to flick this away. Off his pads, and pops up around square leg. They pick up a leg bye before the fielder can bring it in;
1.1;?;Bumrah to Warner, no run length, but a bit too much width. Warner leaves, and Rahul has to scramble away to his left to collect this in front of first slip;
0.6;?;Shami to Finch, no run fuller, straighter, and he drives this to mid-on;
0.5;?;Shami to Finch, no run length, a bit of movement back in, and he defends with a slight forward press;
0.4;?;Shami to Finch, no run drives this firmly back towards the bowler;
0.3;4;Shami to Finch, FOUR runs bit of swing, but width on offer, and he swings this through the point region. It just about makes it to the fence.;
0.2;1;Shami to Warner, 1 run length, a bit of nip away, and takes the outside edge as he looks to drive. Runs along the ground towards third man;
0.1;?;Shami to Warner, no run length, just around off, and he punches this towards cover, where substitute fielder Manish Pandey stops it;

No Pant behind the stumps for India, and hence we have KL Rahul filling in as 'keeper. Kohli sets his field for the opening over. Warner will face up to Shami, who starts with two slips
Sandeep : "not sure why selectors have forgotten about Umesh Yadav. He is definitely better pick than Shardul, in my opinion."
Mustafa Moudi: "Both Warner and Smith are going to score a Century Today. You read it First Here !!"
