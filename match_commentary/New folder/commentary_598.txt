Data
So India finish with 469. We said earlier that if Dhoni comes good India will get somewhere close to 500. They should be happy with this but may be a trifle disappointed at how the innings ended. At least two out of the last four wickets were giveaways.
Nevertheless, Dhoni's knock was welcome and this will prop his Test average. He looked to attack and played his natural game. Siddle has done well for himself on debut picking up 3 for 114. All he needs is more helpful conditions. Do join us shortly for the Australian reply.

A big inswinger by Siddle, Dhoni moves across his stumps and attempts to work it to the on side for a single, it appears as if he got an inside edge onto his pads, Siddle is confident and Koertzen raises the finger, that may have missed the legstump as well, I need to see another replay of that;MS Dhoni lbw b Siddle 92 (176m 124b 8x4 4x6) SR: 74.19;

Johnson into the attack
 Innings Start
11.02 am: The margin of 320 runs is India's biggest victory in Test cricket (not counting innings victories). The Australians line up to congratulate the Indians as they troop off the ground. Dhoni's got a stump as a souvenir, but, seeing that Ganguly doesn't have one, he gives it to him.
"Cant get better from an Indian bowling point of view - Bhajji starts it all, Ishant chimes in, Zaheer joins the party and now Mishra wants to wrap it up. Good all round performance," says Ravi.
Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of selectors, high-fives each of the Indian players as they go into the dressing room. There's a particularly big one for Dhoni, who's been fantastic in this match. Fantastic with the bat, and in the field.
Ponting: "Right from the first morning India were nice and aggressive. they took the momentum away from us early in the game. They thoroughly deserve their victory and congratulations to them ... We'll probably have a couple of days off after this, back to back matches are always hard. We'll fine-tune our skills before the next Test ... They're a very good bowling attack, their two seamers were terrific and they used the reverse swing well."
Tendulkar is being given an award from the PCA for becoming the highest run-scorer in Test cricket. One more trophy for an overflowing cabinet. Sourav Ganguly also gets one for it being his final Test in Mohali.
Dhoni: "We got the perfect start after winning the toss and we were up to the mark in all departments. It was a very good track to bat on. I think Mishra bowled really well after a perfect start from the fast bowlers. It was a perfect Test match for us ... A lot depended on how quickly we could get the reverse swing going for nothing much was happening with the new ball. We were able to reverse swing the ball from the 12th or teh 13th over and after that it became hard for the batsman.
Dhoni is also the Man-of-the Match for his two aggressive half-centuries and for his captaincy. His had a terrific match.
That's about it from us at Cricinfo for this Test. We'll be back in a week's time for the Delhi Test. That you for all your emails. On behalf of Kanishkaa and Siddharth Ravindran, this is George Binoy signing off. Cheers!
