17.41: Zimbabwe have done all they could to keep Australia to a manageable target and it's been a commendable effort. Their spinners were exceptional. Elton Chigumbura said at the toss that they were hoping to keep Australia below 270. Well they've done that. Now their batsmen have to handle the searing pace of Tait, Lee and Johnson.

49.6;1;Mpofu to Johnson, 1 run full toss outside off stump, Johnson swings hard and hits it down the ground towards long on.;
49.5;4;Mpofu to Johnson, FOUR runs Johnson lifts the ball with the angle into him and places it into the gap on the deep square leg boundary. That's his zone and Mpofu needs to keep away from it. Full outside off is the way to go.;
49.4;2;Mpofu to Johnson, 2 runs a low full toss outside off stump. Driven powerfully towards long off where a fumble from Coventry allows the second;
49.3;1;Mpofu to Clarke, 1 run another full and straight ball, Clarke swings it towards long-on for one;
49.2;?;Mpofu to Clarke, no run excellent ball to follow up, a yorker in the blockhole. Clarke digs it out. Such is life. A rubbish ball gets a wicket, an excellent one doesn't.;
49.1;W;Mpofu to Smith, OUT Mpofu is very, very lucky. He bowled a rubbish ball, a full toss on leg stump. Smith could have smashed it, anywhere. Instead he sort of chipped it off his pads and straight to the fielder on the deep square leg boundary.;Steven Smith c Chakabva b Mpofu 11 (4m 4b 1x4 1x6) SR: 275;

48.2;4;Price to Smith, FOUR runs and perhaps this is why. Smith backs away to a flat ball and flat-bats it hard down the ground. He's placed it straight enough to beat long-off;
48.1;W;Price to Hussey, OUT and that's why! Bowled him! Hussey charges down the track and aims for the heave down the ground. Price drags it shorter, bowls it quicker and keeps it dead straight. Hussey misses by a long way, and Price hits the stumps.;David Hussey b Price 14 (15m 8b 1x4 1x6) SR: 175;

The batsmen wanted the second and had Mpofu's throw from the deep not hit the stumps directly at the non-striker's end, they would have got the second.

Watto was well forward, but the replays suggest that was crashing into middle and off, three-fourths of the way up. No evidence that it hit bat before pad either. Yep, the third umpire helps Umpire Kettleborough overturn it and Zim have got two in two right today.;Shane Watson lbw b Cremer 79 (113m 92b 8x4 1x6) SR: 85.86;

29.1;1;Cremer to Ponting, 1 run Ponting skips out, gets to the pitch and clips in down the ground for a single;

27.5;6;Cremer to Watson, SIX runs Watto has gone past the nervous 50s in majestic style. Primal violence in that pull, Cremer fed him a gentle half tracker and Watto tried to smash it from the West of India to the East. he got as far as the stands at deep midwicket. Went down on as knee and brutalised it. Bosh.;
27.4;3;Cremer to Ponting, 3 runs almost fooled Cremer down the leg side. Ponting was advancing, Cremer saw him coming and tried to get a leg side stumping, Ponting adjusted and managed to get a tickle down the leg side. Close;

26.4;1;Chigumbura to Watson, 1 run another one on the pads, Watto flicks behind square for one. Zim need to be careful here, they shouldn't let Watto get out of the nervous 50s too soon. Surely they know how many times he's been out in the 50s?;

24.4;1;Taylor to Watson, 1 run fuller length on off stump, Watson reaches out and drives through mid off for one more;
24.3;3;Taylor to Ponting, 3 runs Ponting's class could break the shackles here. He stays back, waits for the ball to turn in and runs it almost out of Taibu's gloves down to third man. You need pedigree to play these shots.;
24.2;2;Taylor to Ponting, 2 runs nice placement from Ponting, stays back to a short of length ball that did not offer much width for the cut, but he guided it expertly into the covers for a couple;
24.1;1;Taylor to Watson, 1 run turning in from a length, outside off, swatted down the ground for a single;

18.5;W;Utseya to Haddin, OUT Zimbabwe's first ever referral now. Utseya lands this back of a length outside off and it comes in gently with the angle, and then sharply with the spin. Haddin looks to work it through square leg, casually off the back foot, and is hit in front of middle. It was hitting middle and leg. Not sure why Asoka de Silva said not out. The third umpire overturns the verdict. Zimbabwe have struck.;Brad Haddin lbw b Utseya 29 (68m 66b 3x4 0x6) SR: 43.93;

17.3;?;Cremer to Haddin, no run nice stuff, the flat delivery that goes on without spinning. Skids into the pads of Haddin, surprised as he is caught on the crease;
17.2;?;Cremer to Haddin, no run again, tossed up and driven down the track, hits the stumps at the bowler's end. Doesn't touch the bowler's hand and Watson was in, in any case;

14.6;1;Utseya to Haddin, 1 run bunts the last delivery to the leg side for a single;
14.5;?;Utseya to Haddin, no run lovely fielding from Ervine, saves four runs for his side. Tossed up outside off, Haddin drives against the spin and it seems headed for the cover boundary. Ervine goes completely horizontal as he runs from mid off and dives, and collects cleanly with the left arm. Not even a single in the end.;
14.4;?;Utseya to Haddin, no run full outside off, driven into the off side;
14.3;1;Utseya to Watson, 1 run;
14.2;1;Utseya to Haddin, 1 run ah, Hadiin drives in the same direction as Utseya dives into Watson as he looks to stop it. Most people can't find a way past Watson. Utseya doesn't either. Single down the ground;
14.1;1;Utseya to Watson, 1 run very fill and straight, Watson drives past the bowler for a single;
13.6;4;Mpofu to Haddin, FOUR runs silky smooth and slick from Haddin as Australia get 17 off the over. Back of a length, in fact too short outside off. It was there for cross-batted brutalisation through the off side, but Haddin decided to deal with finesse. He just waved the wand through the line, the way Damien Martyn would have and sends it away over the covers for four;
13.5;?;Mpofu to Haddin, no run Mpofu responds with a bouncer, Haddin was charging again, but decided to back out of the shot;
13.4;4;Mpofu to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin opens up now. He set himself up for the drive as he took a step out of the crease, but Mpofu kept it short of the length. That did not deter Haddin, who just extended the arms and swat-dragged it over wide mid on. Clean hit;
13.3;1;Mpofu to Watson, 1 run back of a length and very close to off, the patent on one knee steer to third man from Watson.;
13.2;4;Mpofu to Watson, FOUR runs finally Australia realise this is not the World Test Championship. Mpofu bangs a short, friendly offcutter and Watson cracks the pull shot with the kind of fluency he showed in the Ashes. No one had a chance as it flew away well in front of square;
13.1;4;Mpofu to Watson, FOUR runs 116 kph, rare loose delivery from Mpofu. In fact, just his second in the day as he delivers the full offcutter on leg stump. Once again, Watson tucks in with a flick through square leg;
12.6;?;Utseya to Haddin, no run Ah, what happened there? One of those rare occasions when the ball hit the stumps without disturbing the bails, I reckon. Replays awaited. Flat and turning in from Utseya, Haddin was keen to work it to the leg side, he played all around it as opened his stance and looked to flick. It ran off the inside edge, between his legs and hits the base of the leg stump. The bail stays put. Haddin smiles, Taibu moans. Some excitement after 13 quiet overs.;
12.5;?;Utseya to Haddin, no run on Haddin's pads, he works it to the leg side. No run;

10.5;?;Utseya to Haddin, no run another yes-no situation, Haddin works him with the spin off the pads to square leg. He runs, Watto doesn't. He stops, Watto charges. All order restored in the end.;
10.4;?;Utseya to Haddin, no run;
10.3;?;Utseya to Haddin, no run leans out and gets to the flight to defend again. Three men in the deep on the leg side;

10.1;?;Utseya to Haddin, no run flight! On middle and off, Haddin reaches out and defends;
9.6;1;Price to Haddin, 1 run finally Haddin gets a single, works it wide of mid on for a single. What a dawdle.;
9.5;?;Price to Haddin, no run there's no intent for a single here, Haddin again covers the line and blocks.;
9.4;?;Price to Haddin, no run and again, why so defensive? Haddin blocks a delivery on leg stump to the leg side. Price shares his dinner plans with Watson. Watson doesn't like it. Aha!;
9.3;?;Price to Haddin, no run back of a length on off stump, Hadidn stays back and defends;
9.2;?;Price to Haddin, no run straighter this time, again worked off the pads and cut off backward of square leg;
9.1;?;Price to Haddin, no run Price lands this on leg stump, Haddin works it square straight to the man at square leg;
8.6;?;Mpofu to Watson, no run over-pitched slower ball, Watson presses out into the drive with more power this time, but straight to mid off;
8.5;1;Mpofu to Haddin, 1 run over-pitched outside off, Haddin deals with it without violence, leaning out and pushing it through mid off for a single;
8.4;?;Mpofu to Haddin, no run that touch of inward nip again, Haddin hangs back and tries to get inside the line and work it to the leg side. Can't get a single though;
8.3;1;Mpofu to Watson, 1 run another offcutter this time ends on the pads and Watson easily clips it behind square for a single;
8.2;?;Mpofu to Watson, no run make that 18. Fuller length outside off, Watson plays that trademark on a knee squarish cover drive, but without power;
8.1;?;Mpofu to Watson, no run Mpofu gets the offcutter going again, from outside off and Watto defends down the track. That's his 17th dot ball in 4.1 overs;
7.6;1;Price to Watson, 1 run on Watto's pads, he closes the face of the bat and picks up a single through midwicket;
7.5;1;Price to Haddin, 1 run gets the single this time as Price flattens the length;
7.4;4;Price to Haddin, FOUR runs that's the sort of shot that makes you wonder why Haddin doesn't have a better average. Superb footwork, just backs away an imperceptible foot to the leg side, and hence is in position to drive Price against the spin. He unfurls the most pleasing of cover drives and it slithers away to the fence.;
7.3;?;Price to Haddin, no run length ball, no spin on middle and leg, Haddin defends down the track;
7.2;?;Price to Haddin, no run slows this one up, Haddin looks to sweep but can't beat the man at short fine;

6.4;?;Mpofu to Watson, no run angling in towards the pads, Watson gets the front foot across and works it to square leg.;
6.3;1;Mpofu to Haddin, 1 run whoa Watto, don't try to steal singles from that pocket dynamo Tatenda! Haddin looks to dab a delivery outside off, and it goes nowhere. Taibu runs up and swoops on it and has a go, but misses the stumps. Watson had to fly to make his ground;
6.2;?;Mpofu to Haddin, no run back of a length outside off and Haddin defends into the off side;
6.1;1;Mpofu to Watson, 1 run well bowled Mpofu, slips in a near-perfect yorker on leg stump, but he doesn't have the extra pace. Watson did not expect it, and managed to jam the bat down and squeeze it away to mid on for a hustled single;

Roshan: "Can anyone make sure Sreesanth watching the first ten overs of this match?? Please!!" Hmmm.
 Innings Start
21.36 So Australia have wrapped this up by 91 runs. They took a little longer than they would have liked to bowl out Zimbabwe but it's a satisfactory result. Ponting's unbeaten run as World cup captain continues.
Zimbabwe stayed in the game for quite a while with a tight bowling performance from their spinners. But their inability to take frequent wickets allowed Australia to post a strong total, which their fast bowlers were able to defend with ease.
The presentation ceremony is about to begin.
Chigumbura: "I thought we restricted them to the score e wanted to chase. but we have to work on our batting. It was a good wicket to bat on. The fifth bowler is something we have to work on as well. But overall our bowling and fielding was superb. We just lost too many wickets up front."
Ponting: "Good start for us today. Zimbabwe bowled and fielded really well. Slow wicket and tough to get any pace on the ball. Preserving wickets is going to be our strategy through the tournament ... The wicket was slow and hard to bat on. We kept wickets in hand and gave ourselves a chance to score a good total."
The Man of the Match is Shane Watson. "It took a while to get going, get used to the conditions," he says. "But it's nice to get used to different conditions and find a way ... a good time to get a bit of practice in. "
Well that's that from us at ESPNcricinfo today. Join us tomorrow for the game between England and Netherlands which begins at 14.30 local time. On behalf of Nitin and Raghav, this is George Binoy signing off. Cheers.

25.1;1;Krejza to Chakabva, 1 run;
24.6;W;Tait to Williams, OUT Tait's blown Williams away with 144.7 kph of unplayable pace. Almost a yorker again, from wide of the crease from round the wicket, homes the guided missile in on the line of off stump. Williams has played back to everything, think he'd make a good playback singer. He hangs deep in the crease again and hangs the bat out feebly. It took the edge and flew away at inexplicable pace towards the right of Watto at slip and he does real well to bend down and pluck it low. On second view, it was more a full length ball than a yorker. Still, unplayable.;Sean Williams c Watson b Tait 28 (40m 40b 1x4 1x6) SR: 70;
24.5;1;Tait to Chakabva, 1 run finally gets bat on ball, opens the face and guides it from outside off through backward point;
24.4;?;Tait to Chakabva, no run another short one at 138 kph outside off, Regis weaves out of harm's way;
24.3;?;Tait to Chakabva, no run and now the bouncer, some serious pace being worked up, Regis ducks;
24.2;?;Tait to Chakabva, no run shortens the length this time, but doesn't reduce the pace, Regis slashes hard. At thin air.;
24.1;?;Tait to Chakabva, no run that's what Tait does best, a Waqar Younisesque thunderbolt straight at the toes, and Regis has no clue where it went after hastily removing his feet from the danger area and stopping the irresistable force. What a yorker.;
23.6;1;Krejza to Chakabva, 1 run tossed up outside off, he goes for the bent knee extra cover drive, with a wristy flourish and gets a single to the deep;
23.5;?;Krejza to Chakabva, no run this one breaks in from outside off, defended off the backfoot to the off side;
23.4;1;Krejza to Williams, 1 run short ball, turning away from outside off and cut to deep backward point;
23.3;?;Krejza to Williams, no run angled down the leg side, he goes for the sweep and plays it to short fine leg;
23.2;1;Krejza to Chakabva, 1 run short of a length and turning down the leg, worked off the pads through square leg;
23.1;?;Krejza to Chakabva, no run flighted outside off and straightening, defended down the track by Regis.;
22.6;?;Tait to Williams, no run slightly shorter in length, still Williams looks to drive. He times it well, but straight to point;
22.5;?;Tait to Williams, no run over-pitched wide of the crease, Williams jams the bat down on it and steers it square, but straight to the fielder;
22.4;1;Tait to Chakabva, 1 run 137 kph, he's looking for the yorker, but this one is on the pads and is clipped through square leg for one;
22.3;1;Tait to Williams, 1 run full pitched on middle and leg, Williams gets behind the line and defends to the off side;
22.2;2;Tait to Williams, 2 runs width from Tait, Williams does the smart thing, uses the pace and slaps it backward of square. Sweeper cover runs across and keeps it down to two;
22.1;?;Tait to Williams, no run fires it in full and from wide of the crease, at 137 kph, Williams hangs in the crease and steers to point;
21.6;?;Krejza to Chakabva, no run aha, the ball is stopping on him. Regis tries to go back to a short ball and work it to the leg side with the spin. Ends up playing it too early and almost pops a return catch;
21.5;?;Krejza to Chakabva, no run thrown up well wide outside off and he lets it go. Almost a wide;
21.4;?;Krejza to Chakabva, no run;
21.3;?;Krejza to Chakabva, no run again some big turn from outside off as Regis tries to play through the off side;
21.2;W;Krejza to Chigumbura, OUT Elton's gone. Krejza throws this up well outside off and he goes for the lap-sweep. Too ambitious, he had to bring that around from a long way off, and ended up getting gloving a top edge that popped up on the off side. Haddin runs across and pouches it, then hurries back to effect a stumping, just in case. Elton was already walking away though.;Elton Chigumbura c ?Haddin b Krejza 14 (44m 25b 2x4 0x6) SR: 56;
21.1;1;Krejza to Williams, 1 run short of a length and straightening from outside off, cut away through cover point for one;

20.4;?;Watson to Williams, no run over-pitched outside off, Williams leans into the drive and gets it out to cover inside the circle;

20.2;?;Watson to Williams, no run fuller on middle and off, Williams gets half forward and defends compactly;
20.1;?;Watson to Williams, no run back of a length and angling across, Watto will do this all day. Williams defends from the crease;
19.6;4b;Krejza to Chigumbura, 4 byes well, the spin is in. Krejza does a Murali as this breaks in from outside off, changing course as if it is drunk. It beats Elton's drive, beats Haddin, beats everything and goes for four. Big bounce too, took it over the stumps.;
19.5;?;Krejza to Chigumbura, no run turns in nicely from outside off, and Elton defends;
19.4;1;Krejza to Williams, 1 run Williams rocks back and cuts despite not having much room, and gets a single to deep point;
19.3;3;Krejza to Chigumbura, 3 runs well played Elton, plays the field to perfection. Tossed up and turning into him from outside off, Elton knew there was a gap at deep extra cover and decided to drive against the spin in the air. Almost went all the way too.;
19.2;1;Krejza to Williams, 1 run and now one that stays low, Williams gets bat on the cut and picks a single in front of cover point;
19.1;?;Krejza to Williams, no run prodigious spin from Krejza, drifts into off stump line and then breaks away viciously past the attempted cut. Hmm.;
18.6;1;Watson to Williams, 1 run Williams retains strike with a push into the covers. It is all very quiet at the moment as the Required rate crosses 6.;
18.5;?;Watson to Williams, no run full length on middle and leg, Williams looks to flick and gets a leading edge,;

18.1;?;Watson to Williams, no run Williams hangs back and defends to the off side as Watto angles another one innocously across him;
17.6;1;Krejza to Williams, 1 run gets closer to the pitch and drives along the ground through mid off for one;
17.5;?;Krejza to Williams, no run good response from Krejza, extra turn from middle and off line as Williams leans out, it goes off the outside half towards point;
17.4;6;Krejza to Williams, SIX runs who, where did that come from? Williams has seen enough of Krejza's flight, plonks the front foot down the track and swings him majestically over deep midwicket. Ka-boom.;
17.3;?;Krejza to Williams, no run Williams continues to defend as Krejza tosses it up;
17.2;1;Krejza to Chigumbura, 1 run again skips out, this time he gets to the pitch and works it wide of mid on for a single;

16.6;?;Watson to Williams, no run good start from Watto, Williams opens the face and steers from outside off towards backward point;
16.5;?;Watson to Williams, no run very full, on the stumps and this time Williams plays through mid on. Not much feet movement, and Sunny Gavaskar doesn't quite appreciate it, on air.;
16.4;?;Watson to Williams, no run similar ball, a touch fuller, similar response from Williams who defends to the off side;
16.3;?;Watson to Williams, no run back of a length and angling across Williams who defends to the off side off the back foot;
16.2;1;Watson to Chigumbura, 1 run on the pads this time, looks to flick and gets some bat and pad on it away through square leg for a single;
16.1;?;Watson to Chigumbura, no run back of a length and coming in with the angle, defended to the off side of the pitch;
15.6;?;Krejza to Williams, no run flatter and on the pads, Williams looks to flick and misses;
15.5;?;Krejza to Williams, no run over-pitched on off, Williams drives straight to mid off;
15.4;?;Krejza to Williams, no run a touch of drift and turn away from off stump, Williams leaves;
15.3;2;Krejza to Williams, 2 runs another edge, this can be frustrating. Williams reaches out and drives without full conviction, and it squeezes away to the right of backward point;
15.2;?;Krejza to Williams, no run straighter, Williams reaches out and smothers the spin;
15.1;4;Krejza to Williams, FOUR runs and the outside edge straight away. Nice flight and spin, it breaks away from Williams who feels for it without getting entirely across, it eludes slip and runs away for four;
14.6;?;Johnson to Chigumbura, no run Chigumbura chases one that slants across him from over the wicket. The length was there for the drive and Chigumbura went for it and was beaten.;
14.5;?;Johnson to Chigumbura, no run defended towards square leg from the crease;
14.4;?;Johnson to Chigumbura, no run the line is on leg stump and the length a touch shorter. Chigumbura tries to glance the ball off his hips but doesn't make proper contact;
14.3;?;Johnson to Chigumbura, no run Chigumbura gets behind the line of a good length delivery on off and middle and defends with a straight bat towards the bowler;
14.2;3;Johnson to Williams, 3 runs Williams stays steady in his crease and plays the square drive through the gap at cover point. Clarke gives chase;
14.1;?;Johnson to Williams, no run Johnson ambles in and targets his short balls at the batsman's body. Willaims ducks right under it;
13.6;4;Tait to Chigumbura, FOUR runs Tait gives Chigumbura some space outside off and he drives a length delivery through extra cover with excellent timing;
13.5;?;Tait to Chigumbura, no run full length on leg stump, this time Chigumbura can't get the leg glance right and the ball hits his pad;
13.4;?;Tait to Chigumbura, no run short of a length ball, Chigumbura defends on the leg side;
13.3;?;Tait to Chigumbura, no run defended on the front foot towards the off side;

12.6;?;Johnson to Williams, no run defended on the off side on the front foot;
12.5;?;Johnson to Williams, no run Johnson hits the pad again as Williams tries to work the ball on the leg side. Missing leg again.;
12.4;?;Johnson to Williams, no run another full and straight ball that hits the pad. Johnson appeals but not as convincingly this time. It might have been missing leg so there's no review.;
12.3;W;Johnson to Ervine, OUT Johnson bowls a full, fast and straight ball that thuds into Ervine's pads as he tries to play across the line and falls over a touch. Johnson roars an appeal but Asoka de Silva is unmoved, again. Haddin is adamant that it should be reviewed. Replays show that it's pretty plumb. Thank goodness for the UDRS today. Asoka's had a shocker.;Craig Ervine lbw b Johnson 0 (13m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
12.2;?;Johnson to Ervine, no run he's been hit, Ervine lost sight of that short ball and wore it on the grill of the helmet;

11.2;W;Tait to Taylor, OUT bowled him! Taylor tried to work the ball on the leg side from his crease and closed the face of the bat. He missed and Tait sped the ball through and grazed the pad before uprooting middle stump. Nothing special, just straight, fast and very effective.;Brendan Taylor b Tait 16 (53m 24b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
11.1;?;Tait to Taylor, no run defended on the front foot towards midwicket;
10.6;?;Johnson to Ervine, no run defended on the front foot towards point;

10.4;?;Johnson to Ervine, no run left alone outside off stump;
10.3;W;Johnson to Taibu, OUT he's given Watson some catching practice at first slip. Taibu tried to guide the ball towards third man by opening the face but the line of the short of a length ball was far too close to the body. He ended up steering it off the face towards Watson's right. He bent swiftly to take a low catch;Tatenda Taibu c Watson b Johnson 7 (23m 17b 1x4 0x6) SR: 41.17;
10.2;1;Johnson to Taylor, 1 run good length ball and Taylor pushes towards mid-off and takes on Ponting's arm. He doesn't have to worry though but Taibu does. Ponting reaches the ball in a flash and throws at the batsman's end. Taibu dives full length but the throw misses;
10.1;?;Johnson to Taylor, no run good length and very straight. Taylor defends towards the bowler;
9.6;?;Lee to Taibu, no run Lee responds with a slower bouncer. Taibu is far too early with his pull shot and gets beaten;
9.5;4;Lee to Taibu, FOUR runs he's placed this! Taibu stands in his crease and slaps a length delivery with power through cover. No feet movement, but excellent timing.;
9.5;1w;Lee to Taibu, 1 wide shorter ball and the line is slanting down leg side. Taibu misses the swivel-pull but that's wide;
9.4;?;Lee to Taibu, no run Lee was looking for the yorker and bowled a low and fast full toss. Taibu brings his bat down in time to keep it out;
9.3;?;Lee to Taibu, no run slower ball and Taibu plays another drive on the off side;
9.2;?;Lee to Taibu, no run a touch fuller and Taibu has a real go at a ball he could have put away. The placement of the square drive however isn't good and he hits it to the man at point;

8.6;2;Johnson to Taylor, 2 runs short of a length on leg and middle, Taylor works the ball off his body through the leg side, there's a direct hit from Hussey as Taylor returns for the second but he's safe;

8.1;1;Johnson to Taylor, 1 run Taylor pushes the ball towards mid-on where Tait, who is perhaps Australia's slowest mover, can't prevent the single;
7.6;?;Lee to Taibu, no run Taibu plays a crisp square drive off the back foot that nearly pierces the infield. Steve Smith flings himself to his right at point and pulls off a tremendous save;
7.5;1;Lee to Taylor, 1 run a full ball this time and there's swing into Taylor who mis-times the push towards cover;
7.4;?;Lee to Taylor, no run good length with a hint of swing into the right-hander, Taylor defends from his crease;
7.3;?;Lee to Taylor, no run short of a length again outside off stump. This one doesn't rise as much so Taylor lets it go;
7.2;4;Lee to Taylor, FOUR runs terrific shot, Taylor waits for the short of a length ball outside off and then chips it deftly over the head of the fielder at first slip. He played that so late;
7.1;1;Lee to Taibu, 1 run short of a length just outside off stump, Taibu slashes it in the air towards third man;
6.6;1;Johnson to Taibu, 1 run worked off the pads towards midwicket;
6.5;?;Johnson to Taibu, no run the full one follows the short one. Taibu pushes from his crease towards cover point;
6.4;?;Johnson to Taibu, no run a superb short ball, very straight and intended to hit the body. Taibu does well to watch the ball and sway out of the way;

5.5;?;Lee to Taibu, no run short of a length and very straight. Taibu opens the face and plays towards point;
5.4;W;Lee to Coventry, OUT this was a likely dismissal. Coventry was edgy against the short ball and tried to pull this one from outside off stump. The top edge swirled high in the air and the ball descended in the region of silly mid-off, where Lee was waiting to take the caught and bowled;Charles Coventry c & b Lee 14 (24m 24b 1x4 1x6) SR: 58.33;
5.3;?;Lee to Coventry, no run defended from the crease towards the off side;
5.2;?;Lee to Coventry, no run Coventry attempts to play the pull but was in no control whatsoever. Lee beats him with the short ball;
5.1;?;Lee to Coventry, no run short of a length ball from Lee gets big on Coventry who defends on the leg side. He looks awkward while playing the short ball off the back foot;
4.6;?;Johnson to Taylor, no run played off the back foot towards cover point;
4.5;1;Johnson to Coventry, 1 run a bit too straight this time from Johnson and Coventry turns the ball off his pads towards fine leg;

4.3;?;Johnson to Coventry, no run played off the back foot towards point;
4.2;?;Johnson to Coventry, no run again there's almost no movement from Coventry. He waits motionless until the ball reaches him and then moves just enough to defend on the off side.;
4.1;?;Johnson to Coventry, no run hits a good length with his first ball and is very straight. Coventry defends from his crease on the off side;
3.6;?;Lee to Taylor, no run left alone outside off stump;
3.5;1;Lee to Coventry, 1 run fuller length and straighter line, flicked off the pads through square leg;
3.4;6;Lee to Coventry, SIX runs that is one of the flattest sixes you'll see! Coventry laid into a length ball outside off and played the square drive with immense power. The ball rocketed off the bat and flew over the point boundary. It carried about ten feet over the boundary and smashed into the wall.;
3.3;?;Lee to Coventry, no run short of a length outside off stump, Coventry barely moves as he lifts his bat out of the way;
3.2;1;Lee to Taylor, 1 run short ball directed at the body. Taylor moves back and across just enough to work the ball behind square;
3.1;?;Lee to Taylor, no run full and straight at 137 kph, Taylor gets behind the line and defends;
2.6;?;Tait to Coventry, no run Coventry jumps back to defend a good length ball and wants one. Taylor doesn't;
2.5;2;Tait to Coventry, 2 runs Coventry gets on to the back foot and punches a shorter ball through the gap at cover point;
2.4;1;Tait to Taylor, 1 run punched off the back foot towards extra cover. More of ball hitting bat than the other way around. He sets off for a single and is home before Ponting's direct hit at the non-striker's end.;
2.4;1w;Tait to Taylor, 1 wide his hearing needs to be exceptional to hear this one, it is extremely wide outside off;
2.3;?;Tait to Taylor, no run Tait tests Taylor with a bouncer at 145 kph. Taylor sways out of the way and hears the ball whizz past;
2.2;?;Tait to Taylor, no run full ball at 148 kph outside off stump, Taylor takes a small step forward and blocks towards cover;
2.1;2;Tait to Taylor, 2 runs short of a length ball angling into the right-hander, Taylor moves back and across and nudges the ball off his hips towards long leg;

1.3;?;Lee to Coventry, no run Coventry gets behind the line of a good length ball and defends on the off side. He doesn't move around much in his crease;

1.1;1;Lee to Taylor, 1 run full ball angling into the right-hander. Taylor works the ball off his pads towards deep square;
0.6;?;Tait to Coventry, no run full and wide and Coventry throws his bat at it, aiming to carve it through the point region. Doesn't make contact;

0.4;?;Tait to Coventry, no run Coventry goes dangerously on to the back foot to a fullish ball that is very straight and defends;
0.3;?;Tait to Coventry, no run good length ball at 143.6 kph outside off stump. Coventry lets it go again;
0.2;?;Tait to Coventry, no run short ball this time, outside off stump, Coventry lets it go through to Haddin;
0.2;1w;Tait to Coventry, 1 wide full and fast but the line is down leg side. Tait doesn't want to be running that long run-up more times than necessary in Indian conditions;
0.1;1;Tait to Taylor, 1 run 144kmh, short of a length and straight. Taylor stands tall on the back foot, dabs it towards the off side with soft hands, and calls for the quick single;

Hosford opens the commentary for the second innings with this offering. "I'm probably needlessly worried here," he says. "The nature of Australia's attack means that although Tait, Johnson and Krejza may take wickets and Zimbabwe will collapse, if all three of them are even slightly off colour my mother could chase 263..."
All I want is a good game. Meanwhile, we have some new apps on the block. For iPhone and Android.
"Could this be the first upset? Would be great in world cup context but I don't see Zim escaping the Aussie pace onslaught," says David.
Taylor and Coventry are opening Zimbabwe's chase. Don't see too many batsmen wearing spectacles these days, but Coventry does. Shaun Tait has the new ball and is at the start of his massive run-up.
