13.15 A breathless finish to the West Indies innings. They needed some momentum after losing their way in the middle overs and it was provided by Pollard, with supporting acts from Russell and Sammy. A tremendous display of power-hitting towards the end of the innings. Australia will need something equally special to ensure West Indies don't take an unassailable lead in the series.
Sivaprasad: "Don't bother about the dot balls, after the end of the innings they might be less than the boundary balls."
Reuel: "Kierron Pollard has definitely gotten better, in the last two years he has played more consistently and responsibly for the team. Congratulations to Polly on a well played century. Hope the bowling and fielding does his effort with the bat some justice."

Adrian Barath and the local lad, Johnson Charles, to open. Brett Lee with the new ball from over the wicket.
Toss, 9am This is a surprise. Australia have won the toss and Shane Watson has decided to bowl. The pitch in St Vincent was so spinner and slow-ball friendly that batting first was the way to go. I wonder if this surface is different.
Barath for Powell is indeed the only change in the West Indies team. The weather is fair at Gros Islet, sunny with white clouds. The pitch is expected to play quicker than the one in St Vincent did. The average score at this venue is about 235, apparently.
8.55 am Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage of the fourth one-dayer in St. Lucia. The series is level 1-1 after the first three games, all of which were in St Vincent.
Australia have made two changes to their team for this game, bringing in batsman Peter Forrest and fast bowler Ben Hilfenhaus, who will play his first game on tour, for allrounder Daniel Christian and offspinner Nathan Lyon.
West Indies have one change. Adrian Barath is fit again so he replaces Kieran Powell. Johnson Charles is set to play his first ODI at home. I doubt there will be any other changes to their team.
 Innings Start
9.20pm: Victory by 42 runs means West Indies take a 2-1 lead in the series. David Hussey and, later, Brett Lee dragged Australia along until the bitter end but West Indies had put enough up on the board to be safe. Unsurprisingly, Kieron Pollard's sustained assault at the end of the West Indies innings was decisive - Australia initially had to pick their way through the wreckage and they had too many low scores at the top of the order. A tip of the cap to Sunil Narine, once again, who had an economy of 2.1 in a game where the majority of the bowling was fodder.
9.30pm: Out on the field, it's time for the presentations ...
Australia captain Shane Watson, asked about choosing to bat: "No I wouldn't have done it differently. In the end we didn't execute with the new ball. I wouldn't have done anything different, just execute better at the start and definitely at the end. Unfortunately at the top of the order me and David Warner haven't been able to bat on deep into the innings - I think that would have made chasing a bit easier. We've seen Kieron Pollard, in the IPL and around the world, how hard he hits the ball. We'll have to revisit our plans to him ... It was a beautiful wicket, like those at home. The St Lucia crowd saw a good game from West Indies, but unfortunately not from us.
Man of the match Kieron Pollard: "To play a match-winning knock feels great. The first couple of games, I had the chance to bat a lot of overs. It's a matter of understanding my role in the team and continuing to try and win games for the West Indies. I've been around a long while now, playing cricket all over the world ... Some of the sixes I didn't middle - but once they get over the line they're all six."
West Indies captain Darren Sammy: "Today was just what we've been looking for, when we were sitting down as a batting group and planning ... With scores from Pollard, Russell and myself, it was the kind of total we could defend. The pitch was fantastic, congratulations to the groundmen and we're looking forward to the final game. It would be good if we could get a series win."
And with that, we'll be signing off. Thanks for your comments and have a good morning/afternoon/night. Join us for the fifth and final ODI on Sunday ... Cheerio!
46.3;W;Roach to Lee, OUT gives it the old heave-ho again but this time Lee can't clear long-off. That's it, West Indies have won!

38.4;W;Roach to Hussey, OUT gone, bowled him! It was a length delivery, quick and ducked in just a little, beating Hussey's drive and clattering into the top of off stump. That could be the curtain call for Australia. They still need 99 to win with just three wickets in hand;David Hussey b Roach 57 (82m 54b 7x4 0x6) SR: 105.55;
38.3;1;Roach to Lee, 1 run and Roach follows it up with a short ball that Lee keeps away from his ribs by nudging into the leg side. All's fair in cricket and war;
38.3;1nb;Roach to Lee, (no ball) ouch! Roach bowls a beamer that strikes Lee flush on the glove. It's a no-ball and Roach goes down the wicket to apologise ... Lee jerked away from that like he'd been scalded. He dropped his bat as the ball struck his left hand, then dropped to his knees. He initially walked away from Roach, as if to compose himself - but he hasn't directed any ill-feeling towards the bowler. And he'll continue to bat ...;

34.1;?;Sammy to Lee, no run length, outside off and cut to point;
33.6;W;Pollard to Wade, OUT gone! Wade slogs high into the St Lucia sky and is caught at long-off! It was a pitched up delivery, outside off but Wade could only get underneath it.
