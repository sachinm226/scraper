Hello everybody. Welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the eighth match of the Commonwealth Bank series. Today's game is between Australia, who've marched into the finals with three games in hand, and New Zealand, who are a point ahead of England. I'm George Binoy and I'll bring you all the action as it unfolds at the WACA.
Toss: Ricky Ponting has won the toss and Australia will bat.
Australia have made two changes to the team that hammered England at Adelaide. Nathan Bracken and Glenn McGrath return in place of Brad Hogg and Stuart Clark. Mitchell Johnson, who was Man-of-the-Match, in the previous game retains his place.
New Zealand are without Nathan Astle who retired from all cricket on Friday and Lou Vincent will take his spot in the XI. Shane Bond is not playing today. Kyle Mills returns to the team after recovering from injury and New Zealand are playing two spinners today in Jeetan Patel and Daniel Vettori.
Australia 1 Adam Gilchrist (wk), 2 Matthew Hayden, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Andrew Symonds, 6 Michael Hussey, 7 Cameron White, 8 Brett Lee, 9 Nathan Bracken 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Glenn McGrath.
New Zealand 1 Stephen Fleming (capt), 2 Lou Vincent, 3 Peter Fulton, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Craig McMillan, 6 Jacob Oram, 7 Brendon McCullum (wk), 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 Kyle Mills, 10 Jeetan Patel, 11 Mark Gillespie.
The umpires for today are Asad Rauf and Simon Taufel. Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden will open the innings as usual. It will be Gilchrist to face Kyle Mills who's bowling from over the wicket with two slips in place.
 Innings Start
John Buchanan had mentioned that Australia wanted a fight and they certainly got one today. Jacob Oram stretched them to the limit and New Zealand finished on 335 for 5. Who'd have thought they would have got so close when the chase started. Oram's hundred off 71 balls is the fastest by a New Zealand player.
Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting set up the victory with twin centuries and Hussey provided an adrenalin-filled finish to spur Australia on to 343 for 5. It almost wasn't enough as Oram and McCullum took New Zealand closer but Glenn McGrath bowled a string of superb yorkers to stem the run flow.
Ricky Ponting is the Player of the Match for his 111 off 122 balls. He added 200 runs for the second wicket with Hayden.
That's it from us at Cricinfo, we'll be back on Tuesday to bring you the action from Perth when England take on New Zealand. I'll been a pleasure bringing this exciting game to you, have a good evening. Cheers!
