Data
And there ends England's innings. Everything looked possible while Pietersen was at the crease and, as ever, he played excellently. Flintoff looked in good touch too but the constant tumbling of wickets at the other end prevented him from getting away from Australia. All in all, a very fine performance from Australia's bowlers. That's it from me. Join Andrew after the innings break for Australia's chase.
49.6;2;Bracken to Flintoff, 2 runs pushed through the covers;
49.5;2;Bracken to Flintoff, 2 runs again steps outside his off stump, meets this on the full and it's timed through midwicket - and they steal a single. Oh no, they're going for two;
49.4;4;Bracken to Flintoff, FOUR runs shot! Freddie steps outside his off stump and swivels this over deep midwicket. Fabulous;
49.3;2;Bracken to Flintoff, 2 runs Flintoff pumps this down the ground to long-on, oh and they're going for two - Symonds throws to the wrong end, and Monty is like grease lightning between the wickets;
49.2;W;Bracken to Lewis, OUT what a catch! A full toss which Lewis sliced off a thick outside edge just to Ponting's right at backward point, and he dived brilliantly taking the ball horizontally, one-handed. Quite superb fielding;Jon Lewis c Ponting b Bracken 9 (13m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
49.1;2;Bracken to Lewis, 2 runs clunked into the covers;
48.6;1;McGrath to Lewis, 1 run smeared through cover;
48.5;2;McGrath to Lewis, 2 runs reasonably aggressive shot from Lewis, giving himself room and hitting over the top;
48.4;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run again it's a touch too full from McGrath and Flintoff is cramped for room, just meekly prodding it down to long-on for another single;
48.3;1;McGrath to Lewis, 1 run well bowled! Excellent cricket from McGrath, full, straight, swinging into Lewis who, to his credit, dug this out well;
48.2;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run forced past extra cover for a single;
48.1;1;McGrath to Lewis, 1 run very full, swinging into Lewis who tries to smear it through cover but gets a thin edge, falling short of Gilchrist, and they manage to steal a single;
41.6;1;Clark to Pietersen, 1 run cracked rib or no cracked rib. That's another single;
41.5;1;Clark to Flintoff, 1 run attempted yorker, punched into space on the leg-side. Useful stand building here;
41.4;1;Clark to Pietersen, 1 run down on one knee and an extravagant drive, followed by a grimace. Those ribs are still smarting;
41.3;1;Clark to Flintoff, 1 run wild swish and a top-edge, but it lands safe and sound. Flintoff fights on;
41.2;4;Clark to Flintoff, FOUR runs a low full-bunger, and clobbered straight down the ground with immense power and timing! Shot, Freddie!;
41.1;2;Clark to Flintoff, 2 runs good length delivery, heaved to long-on, and McGrath fumbles to make a second a formality;
41.1;1w;Clark to Flintoff, 1 wide swinging away down the leg side. Not quite the start we've come to expect;
40.6;1;Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run pushed into the covers;
40.5;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run angled behind square, Clarke is so quick to run round, picks up one-handed and sends in a decent throw;
40.4;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run glanced off the back foot;
40.3;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run shorter, Pietersen tries to pull but can't time it;
40.2;1;Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run Flintoff waits for this on the back foot and bashes it off the back foot through the covers;
40.1;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run clunked into the covers;
47.6;1;Clark to Lewis, 1 run again a full toss; again an England batsman can't do enough with it, just pushing it down the ground;
47.5;1;Clark to Flintoff, 1 run swinging into Flintoff's pads, a full toss which he bashes down the ground;
47.4;2;Clark to Flintoff, 2 runs pushed through midwicket for a single. Oh, they're going for two and they get it comfortably;
47.3;4;Clark to Flintoff, FOUR runs bish bash bosh! Just short of a length, in Flintoff's area and he simply lifts this just wide of long-on for a resounding four;
47.2;1lb;Clark to Lewis, 1 leg bye full, into Lewis's pads who is beaten by the inswing. Startled, he realises the ball has bobbled out into the off side and Flintoff hurries him through for a single;
47.1;1;Clark to Flintoff, 1 run the full bunger on leg stump which hurries Flintoff somewhat, who turns it through midwicket looking for two...but only a single is on offer;
46.6;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run again it's too full for Flintoff to get hold of it and he can only clunk it into the covers;
46.5;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run excellent bowling, an inswinging yorker which Flintoff digs out back to the bowler;
46.4;1;McGrath to Lewis, 1 run oh nicely played from Lewis, just angling this down to third man;
46.3;W;McGrath to Dalrymple, OUT down the leg side, Dalymple tries to hook this and misses. Gilchrist politely asks the umpire who, after a couple of seconds, raises his finger! What a shocker that is. Replays indicate the ball hit his helmet, and Dalrymple trudges off fairly fuming;Jamie Dalrymple c ?Gilchrist b McGrath 2 (8m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
46.2;?;McGrath to Dalrymple, no run boshed to mid off but it's Michael Clarke positioned there...not a man you take a single to;
46.1;?;McGrath to Dalrymple, no run right on the money as usual, just outside off stump and this one cuts back into the batsman who defends off the back foot;
39.6;?;McGrath to Pietersen, no run ouch. Pietersen skips down the pitch to a bouncer and is struck in the chest. Gilchrist pops over for a sledge, as does McGrath and Symonds makes it a trio of insults. No surprise there, given how Pietersen has skipped down the wicket to McGrath all summer (or winter, depending where you live). It just bounced a touch too much, cannoning into his ribs and he slumps to the ground.;
39.5;2;McGrath to Pietersen, 2 runs deliciously driven down the ground with the straightest of bats. Again, a marvellous shot just for a single though;
39.4;?;McGrath to Pietersen, no run smashed with a flourish but he can't find the gap at extra cover;
39.3;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run swinging into Flintoff's pads who gives himself a touch of room outside leg, opening the face and guiding it to cover;
39.2;1;McGrath to Pietersen, 1 run shot! What an extraordinary shot just for a single, down the pitch and slapping it through midwicket;
39.1;?;McGrath to Pietersen, no run ooh, excellent bouncer which is quickly evaded by the batsman;
38.6;?;Clarke to Flintoff, no run defended on the front foot;
38.5;4;Clarke to Flintoff, FOUR runs slog swept with immense power over deep midwicket. Calmly, solidly smashed;
38.4;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run he stands tall here, elegantly driving it down the ground;
38.3;1;Clarke to Flintoff, 1 run drifting down the leg side and Flintoff turns his wrists, placing this through midwicket for a single;
38.2;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run full and straight and hit down the ground once more, but without sufficient power;
38.1;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run;
37.6;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run angled off the back foot to Clarke at backward point. They go for a single, oh no they don't - Clarke sends in a throw and Pietersen dives back in his crease at the non-striker's end;
37.5;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run oh dear, a very ugly, concrete-footed swish outside his off stump from Flintoff;
37.4;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run well bowled! Full, inswinging yorker which Flintoff digs out;
37.3;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run ooh and a welcoming bouncer from McGrath, Flintoff ducks out of the way;
37.2;W;McGrath to PD Collingwood, OUT the slower ball from McGrath, Collingwood picks it but can't execute this lofted shot as well as he might and it's hit straight to Johnson at long on;Paul Collingwood c Johnson b McGrath 43 (76m 70b 2x4 0x6) SR: 61.42;
37.1;2;McGrath to PD Collingwood, 2 runs full, on off stump and Collingwood check-drives this past McGrath, down the ground and Mitchell Johnson sprints from long-on to save four. Excellent fielding;
36.6;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run down the pitch but Collingwood again can't time it;
36.5;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run an ugly reverse sweep from Collingwood. Not timed;
36.4;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run ooh and Pietersen shuffles across, and down, the pitch and sweeps it to fine leg;
36.3;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run on leg stump and it's well timed, albeit without much power, to long on;
36.2;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run that's the right length, nice and full and straight;
36.1;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run punched down the ground on the front foot;
35.6;?;White to Pietersen, no run timed down - and along - the ground;
35.5;6;White to Pietersen, SIX runs here we go! Straighter this time, Pietersen crashes it over the bowler's head, flatter. But the same result;
35.4;6;White to Pietersen, SIX runs oh yes, that's massive. Ping pang, and Pietersen smashes this over long on;
35.3;?;White to Pietersen, no run down the pitch and Pietersen pings this straight into Collingwood's knee. Ouch. Just short of the knee in fact;
35.2;2;White to Pietersen, 2 runs swept on the full down to fine leg, very well played;
35.1;1;White to PD Collingwood, 1 run chipped over short midwicket, "catch" is the cry from Gilchrist but it's neatly placed;
34.6;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run down the pitch and pushed, without great power or timing, for a single;
34.5;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run the wrong line from Clarke, drifting down leg and it's easily turned round the corner for a single;
34.4;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run a very nice late cut, delicately played;
34.3;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run expansively driven but straight to cover;
34.2;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run and Collingwood comes down the pitch this time but can only push it back to the bowler;
34.1;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run down the pitch confidently and punched to long on;
33.6;?;White to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood defends this on the front foot. Gilchrist "loves" it apparently.;
33.5;1;White to Pietersen, 1 run pushed down the ground;
33.4;6;White to Pietersen, SIX runs bash! That's the way to do it, hitting it over extra cover - high and handsome for six. That was a beaut.;
33.3;1;White to PD Collingwood, 1 run ooh, a nice bit of indrift but Pietersen clunks it to mid on;
33.2;1;White to Pietersen, 1 run defended on the front foot;
33.1;?;White to Pietersen, no run Pietersen comes down the track to make this into a full bunger, but it hits too high on the bat and it's clunked to mid on;
32.6;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run defended on the front foot;
32.5;4;Clarke to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs shot; that's more like it from England. Collingwood hits this over extra cover - Clarke, Gilchrist and just about everyone else cries "catch" but it's very well placed;
32.4;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run pushed to mid on;
32.3;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run half a shuffle down the pitch from Pietersen but Clarke adjusts his length and the batsman can only clunk it to mid on;
32.2;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run timed, not whacked, to cover;
32.1;2;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 2 runs neatly swept to fine leg, who is quite deep, for two;
31.6;2;White to Pietersen, 2 runs worked through midwicket and they scamper two;
31.5;?;White to Pietersen, no run Pietersen comes massively forward, driving to mid on;
31.4;?;White to Pietersen, no run just outside off, the big non-turner from White again and Pietersen prods it to cover;
31.3;?;White to Pietersen, no run Pietersen comes down the track but White sees him and it hits his pad;
31.2;1;White to PD Collingwood, 1 run full, on middle stump and it's well timed down the ground;
31.1;?;White to PD Collingwood, no run just outside off, the googly which Collingwood reads - I think - and he cuts it without timing;
30.6;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run punched to midwicket and Pietersen raws a Neanderthalesque "no";
30.5;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run and he meets the length of this, sweeping it fine - timing it nicely, too;
30.4;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run just a touch shorter of a length and it's punched off the back foot through midwicket;
30.3;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run on leg stump and he works it to leg;
30.2;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run "noice" shouts Gilchrist to one on leg stump which Pietersen pings to mid on;
30.1;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run Pietersen has absolutely hammered this straight back to Clarke...bump ball, but that would've stung;
29.6;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run a little wider of the off stump but it's just short of a length and Collingwood can't time it. Again.;
29.5;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run driven on the front foot but straight to cover;
29.4;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run good, tight bowling; on middle stump and it's defended off the back foot;
29.3;1;Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run pushed down the ground;
29.2;1;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run worked off his pads for a single;
29.1;4;Bracken to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs whipped off his legs to White at deep midwicket, it's in the air and going straight down his throat - but no! The sun beats him! He makes a total hash of it, ducking his head and the ball bobbles over for four;
28.6;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run excellently bowled; he saw the batsman coming down the track and banged it down short, and on his pads, preventing him from driving;
28.5;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run punched down the ground;
28.4;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run ooh and he goes for it again but misses, and is hit on the pad;
28.3;2;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 2 runs delicately reverse swept down to third man;
28.2;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run ooh, lovely shot punching it straight down the ground but just for a single;
28.1;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run swept without power to a short fine leg;
27.6;1;Bracken to PD Collingwood, 1 run and eventually he gets a run, clunking it off the back foot - but the length was again excellent from Bracken and Collingwood can't time it;
27.5;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run and it's a touch shorter this time, Collingwood goes for a delicate late glance but misses;
27.4;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run on leg stump this time but Collingwood, despite whipping it forcefully off the back foot, can't find the gap at midwicket;
27.3;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run fuller still and Collingwood times this back to the bowler;
27.2;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run full and straight, clipped down to mid-on;
27.1;?;Bracken to PD Collingwood, no run cut, or late cut, but straight to point. Still can't find the gap;
26.6;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run another paddle, and another single.;
26.5;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run;
26.4;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run down on one knee and paddled away for a single;
26.3;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run good flight and loop, Clarke is not afraid to tease the England batsmen at the moment;
26.2;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run;
26.1;?;Clarke to Pietersen, no run;
25.6;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run lovely ball, angled away from the right-hander, and just eludes the edge as well;
25.5;2;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 2 runs a rare couple for the struggling Collingwood, who slaps the ball off the front foot to cover;
25.4;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run back of a length and slapped out to the cover sweeper;
25.3;1;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run;
25.2;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run slower delivery, and a mistimed flick is the result from Collingwood;
25.1;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run full onto the stumps and pushed into the covers;
24.6;1;Clarke to PD Collingwood, 1 run good loop and flight, and glanced down to fine leg;
24.5;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run more width this time, but the same result. Pressure, pressure;
24.4;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run;
24.3;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run;
24.2;?;Clarke to PD Collingwood, no run flighted delivery and pushed into the covers;
24.1;1;Clarke to Pietersen, 1 run tidy loop and decent line,;
23.6;2;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 2 runs a thickish drive brings up England's 100;
23.5;2;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 2 runs oooh ... lucky lucky! Fended into space behind point, but Collingwood should have been run out as he dived for his second run. The pressure is really telling out there for England;
23.4;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run opens the face and attempts to pick up a single, but Pietersen rightly sends him back;
23.3;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run nor there. Lovely tight bowling from Johnson. That left-arm angle is toying with Collingwood's mind;
23.2;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run nope, no way through there;
23.1;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run glanced to backward square leg;
22.6;1;Clark to Pietersen, 1 run driven into the gap at long-on, but no freebies on offer;
22.5;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run back and defends. At least there are still wickets intact;
22.4;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run a big hooning drive, but again no timing. Picked up in the covers, as the pressure ticks up again;
22.3;1;Clark to PD Collingwood, 1 run on the back foot, and turned to square leg;
22.2;?;Clark to PD Collingwood, no run pushed into the covers once again. God, England are rubbish at one-dayers;
22.1;?;Clark to PD Collingwood, no run solid back-foot defence. But solidity isn't the be-all and end-all;
21.6;1;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run good length again, and pushed into the leg side;
21.5;2;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 2 runs up in the air ... but safe! That was a loose pull from Collingwood, but it spiralled just out of the reach of Symonds, running back from mid-on;
21.4;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run lovely ball, gently but deceptively swinging, and beats Collingwood's loose drive;
21.3;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run pushed to cover, but with no power;
21.2;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run;
21.1;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run more positive intent from Pietersen as he comes down the track, and edges a drive down to third man;
20.6;?;Clark to PD Collingwood, no run firm wallop through the off side, but nicely intercepted at point by Michael Clarke;
20.6;2nb;Clark to Pietersen, (no ball) 1 run tucked off the hips to keep the strike, but it's a no-ball, so one more to come;
20.5;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run more brilliant fielding, this time from Andrew Symonds in the covers;
20.4;4;Clark to Pietersen, FOUR runs Shot! A perfect straight drive - an easy stride followed by a full flowing bat. Shaves the stumps at the non-striker's end, and all the way to the fence;
20.3;1;Clark to PD Collingwood, 1 run nudged into the leg side with minimal foot movement, and there it is. He's doubled his tally;
20.2;?;Clark to PD Collingwood, no run more watchful in defence, as Collingwood continues to struggle to double his runs tally&;
20.1;1;Clark to Pietersen, 1 run trouble here! Ponting dives, fields, rolls and flings, but just misses the stumps from midwicket. Collingwood would have been out for all money. Brilliant stuff;
19.6;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run on the legs, but still no way to whip it away. England are under the cosh here;
19.5;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run banged in back of a length, angled across towards the slips. And another dot ball;
19.4;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run still in that off-stump corridor, and defended with a late shuffle;
19.3;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run brilliantly nagging line-and-length bowling going on here. Collingwood connects this time, but can't apply any pace to the ball;
19.2;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run outside off stump, Collingwood takes a swish but the ball keeps a touch low and scuttles through to the keeper;
19.1;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run;
18.6;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run onto the front foot, by way of a change, but it's the same result&;
18.5;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run onto the back foot and defended watchfully;
18.4;2;Clark to Pietersen, 2 runs another flick, another couple of runs, but safer this time as the throw comes in from deep midwicket;
18.3;2;Clark to Pietersen, 2 runs not the best of throws, and Collingwood quite possibly should have been on his way there! Back for two, and Hayden's throw from mid-on has the batsman sprawling at the non-striker's end;
18.2;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run;
18.1;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run lodged on the back foot, and unable to find any gaps at midwicket;
17.6;3;Johnson to Pietersen, 3 runs not timed, but effective as the ball pulls up inside the fine leg rope. How much now rests on this man ...;
17.5;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run;
17.4;1;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run off the mark instantly with a nudge through square leg, but England have a bit of regrouping to do here;
17.3;W;Johnson to Bell, OUT Gottim! And you have to say that was coming! Johnson's been turning the screw superbly since he came on, and this time Bell couldn't hold himself back - down the track, and a loose drive straight to mid-off, comfortably lodged in Mike Hussey's midriff;Ian Bell c Hussey b Johnson 15 (54m 29b 2x4 0x6) SR: 51.72;
17.2;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run good length delivery, driven straight down the ground. Cut off by mid-off, but he can't stop the single;
17.1;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run shuffled across his stumps and picked up at midwicket;
16.6;?;Clark to Bell, no run outside off stump, and left well alone;
16.5;1;Clark to Pietersen, 1 run on the back foot again, and tucked to midwicket;
16.4;4;Clark to Pietersen, FOUR runs that's the shot! He's been looking for that one ever since he came to the crease, but this time Pietersen walks straight into an effortless straight drive. He's starting to find his range now ...;
16.3;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run lovely delivery. Tight on the stumps, Pietersen can only offer a straight bat, and he's lucky not to get the edge as the ball whistles through;
16.2;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run on the back foot, turned to short midwicket;
16.1;4;Clark to Bell, FOUR runs at last, some welcome runs for Bell, steered past point to the boundary;
15.6;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run another rash drive, but this time the ball fizzes through to the keeper. Another fine over;
15.5;4;Johnson to Pietersen, FOUR runs he has now! And it's a streaky slash through the vacant slip cordon, and all the way to the boundary. Well, they all count;
15.4;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run the frustration is palpable. Still no way through. Johnson hasn't conceded a run in ten deliveries;
15.3;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run KP tries to find room in the gully this time, but can't;
15.2;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run a wild flog of a shot through the covers, but again KP can't beat the field. It's a war of attrition out there;
15.1;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run leg-side, and played off the back foot to midwicket;
14.6;?;Clark to Bell, no run not an easy time out there for Bell at the moment. He's a bit fidgetty at the crease and can't get this one away through the gully;
14.5;1;Clark to Pietersen, 1 run down the pitch again, and tucked away to midwicket;
14.5;1w;Clark to Pietersen, 1 wide leg side and called. A rare aberration;
14.4;2;Clark to Pietersen, 2 runs on the pads again, and flicked in the air through the vacant square leg;
14.3;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run opens the face and plays into the gully;
14.2;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run he's on the walk again, three casual steps down the track, followed by a cool pushed defence.;
14.1;?;Clark to Pietersen, no run on the pads and flicked away, but a brilliant sprawling stop from Ponting at midwicket. The Aussies are electric in the field;
13.6;?;Johnson to Bell, no run a more forceful, front-foot drive, but again, there's no beating the field. A maiden to start Johnson's spell;
13.5;?;Johnson to Bell, no run swinging into the pads, Bell misses out on a flick through midwicket;
13.4;?;Johnson to Bell, no run more comfortable line and length for the batsman, and that's pushed coolly into the covers;
13.3;?;Johnson to Bell, no run awkward lifter, again on off stump. Bell negotiates with a flick of the wrists into the gully again;
13.2;?;Johnson to Bell, no run;
13.1;?;Johnson to Bell, no run fast arm, but a bit wide of off stump first up. Left well alone;
12.6;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run slightly shorter, jabbing up towards Bell's ribs, and that's fended away for a scampered single. The end of a lovely tight over;
12.5;?;Clark to Bell, no run nothing more than the basics here for Clark, but they are mighty effective. Back of a length once again, and a dot ball once again;
12.4;?;Clark to Bell, no run fuller and straighter onto the pads, and clipped to the man at short midwicket;
12.3;?;Clark to Bell, no run slightly wider this time, but a checked drive can't beat the field;
12.2;?;Clark to Bell, no run more of the same. He's found that awkward length already;
12.1;?;Clark to Bell, no run nice start from Clark - just back of a length, wobbly seam, watchful defence;
11.6;?;Bracken to Pietersen, no run defensive once again, and a slight inside-edge onto the pads. Lovely over;
11.5;?;Bracken to Pietersen, no run lovely delivery! Saw Pietersen looking to advance, and hit the deck extra hard, with the ball zipping off a good length and just missing the edge of the bat;
11.4;?;Bracken to Pietersen, no run good length delivery and a hurried defensive prod;
11.3;?;Bracken to Pietersen, no run driven firmly, but can't beat the field;
11.2;1;Bracken to Bell, 1 run;
11.1;1;Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run a controlled slash from Pietersen goes straight through the gap at fourth slip, and arrives at third man on the second bounce;
10.6;?;McGrath to Bell, no run outside off stump, and left well alone;
10.5;?;McGrath to Bell, no run up and onto his toes, and driven square to a diving Michael Clarke at point, who roars with anguish that he failed to field it cleanly. Perfectionists, these Aussies.;
10.4;3;McGrath to Pietersen, 3 runs a thickish outside-edge to get off the mark, beats the field but pulls up inside the rope;
10.3;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run wider this time, and slapped into the covers to bring the big dog, KP, onto strike;
10.2;?;McGrath to Bell, no run wicket-to-wicket delivery, and another perpendicular face of the bat;
10.1;?;McGrath to Bell, no run time to regroup for England, and for Cricinfo, and Bell starts with a watchful defensive stroke;
9.6;?;Bracken to Pietersen, no run right, we are officially back up to speed. What a total shambles. Apologies for all that, but it's the end of the first powerplay, and time to take stock.

11.4;6;Flintoff to Gilchrist, SIX runs blimey! That's huge! A vast swing of the blade, and that's still going up as it crosses the rope at long-on. Nice catch in the crowd, by a bloke on his mobile phone!;

11.2;1;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run;

7.4;?;Lewis to Hayden, no run Action replay, minus the overstep, of course;
7.4;1nb;Lewis to Hayden, (no ball) oops, another extra to the tally. Otherwise a tidy length as Hayden leaves well alone;
7.3;4;Lewis to Hayden, FOUR runs short, and clobbered through midwicket with a flat bat! Hayden advanced, Lewis saw him coming, but his attempt to drag the ball down merely turned into the juiciest of long-hops;
7.2;?;Lewis to Hayden, no run pushed to cover off the front foot;
7.1;1;Lewis to Gilchrist, 1 run launched into the leg-side, and Mahmood fields well, stooping with one hand to cut off a certain boundary;
6.6;?;Anderson to Hayden, no run tidy over, and some good movement through the air. There is a bit of assistance going on out there;
6.5;3;Anderson to Gilchrist, 3 runs good ball, but an even better stroke from Gilchrist, and a comedy attempt at a relay throw as Panesar fumbles a lob back from the deep midwicket rope;
6.4;?;Anderson to Gilchrist, no run zippy line and length, and that's respectfully defended with Gilchrist up on his toes. Now, can he finish his good work this over?;

5.6;?;Lewis to Hayden, no run good finish, but another loose over for England. Australia already in absolute command of this run-chase;
5.5;?;Lewis to Hayden, no run at last, some respite for England, as the less frenetic Hayden comes onto strike;
5.4;1;Lewis to Gilchrist, 1 run width again, and heaved into the off side. Just bounces short of Panesar at deep point;
5.3;?;Lewis to Gilchrist, no run tighter, but the intent is still there from a pumped-up Gilly;
5.2;4;Lewis to Gilchrist, FOUR runs now that's timing! A fraction too full, and a free swing of the blade sends the ball spiralling over Flintoff's head at long-on!;
5.1;4;Lewis to Gilchrist, FOUR runs width, and flogged over the covers. Didn't quite time it, but no matter - it's four;
4.6;1;Anderson to Gilchrist, 1 run fuller length, and played slightly uneasily by Gilchrist, who looks back in alarm as he loses sight of the ball. No dangers though, and he's called through. Good running between these two, as ever;
4.5;1lb;Anderson to Hayden, 1 leg bye short and slightly leg-side, but Hayden misses out with a swivel-pull. One more to the tally though, as the ball bobbles into no-man's land;
4.4;1;Anderson to Gilchrist, 1 run a bit of a scamper there for Gilchrist as Flintoff shies from mid-off and hits as well. But the batsman is safely home.;
4.3;4;Anderson to Gilchrist, FOUR runs no swing on that occasion, only a full swing of the bat as an Anderson long-hop is deposited over midwicket.;
4.2;?;Anderson to Gilchrist, no run good full length, and was that a hint of swing? Conceivably ...;
4.1;1;Anderson to Hayden, 1 run pushed into the gap and they cross for a single;
3.6;?;Lewis to Gilchrist, no run outside off stump again, left well alone and through to the keeper. Tidier over, just two runs coming from it;
3.5;?;Lewis to Gilchrist, no run a modicum of control now being applied by England. Not before time;
3.4;1lb;Lewis to Hayden, 1 leg bye shapes to play a pull, and deflects off his ample midriff for a single;
3.3;1b;Lewis to Gilchrist, 1 bye another fumble from cymbals Nixon, on his ODI debut. Late swing deceived him there;
3.2;?;Lewis to Gilchrist, no run back of a length and pushed to cover;
3.1;?;Lewis to Gilchrist, no run trundly pace and a fraction too much width. Nudged down to third man for a single;
2.6;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run a tighter line this time, just outside off stump and Hayden lunges forward, defending on the front foot - albeit with a closed face of the bat;
2.5;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run;
2.4;3;Flintoff to Gilchrist, 3 runs and he gives himself a touch of room, crashing this through extra cover for three. Really well timed, and Mahmood gives chase;
2.3;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run cracked off the back foot, too wide, and smashed to gully;
2.2;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run tighter line, but it's all relative. England are all over the place at the moment;
2.1;4;Flintoff to Gilchrist, FOUR runs that is a beautiful shot! Once again, a bit too wide from Flintoff, and that was cracked on the up, off the back foot, with a ramrod straight bat, clean through the covers;
1.6;?;Lewis to Hayden, no run back on the spot at last. Indifferent stuff from England!;
1.6;1w;Lewis to Hayden, 1 wide oh deary me. Leg-side, swinging, rubbish. England's competitive 242 is already an insubstantial 229;
1.6;1w;Lewis to Hayden, 1 wide a bit wild from Lewis again, and England's extras tally in 2007 is already out of control;
1.5;1;Lewis to Gilchrist, 1 run bit too straight again, and worked off the pads;
1.4;?;Lewis to Gilchrist, no run steady and on the spot from Lewis;
1.3;?;Lewis to Gilchrist, no run that's the spot. Tight on middle and off;
1.2;1;Lewis to Hayden, 1 run too straight, and glanced fine for the first runs off the bat;
1.1;?;Lewis to Hayden, no run that's the way to do it, good line, good length, respectfully played;
0.6;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run and a dot to finish a frenetic first over!;
0.6;5w;Flintoff to Gilchrist, 5 wide that's poor, poor bowling. Wide and loose, and deflected past first slip by the keeper;
0.5;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run;
0.4;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run wide and slashed, and a big ooh from the keeper;
0.3;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run more of the same, better line;
0.2;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run short of a length, pushed into the covers.;
0.1;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run almost another one, taken in front of first slip by a tumbling Nixon;
0.1;5w;Flintoff to Gilchrist, 5 wide oops, that's awful. Leg-side and swinging and all the way to the boundary;
0.1;1w;Flintoff to Gilchrist, 1 wide wide of the off stump, very wide in fact. Two bounces to the keeper;

Here's the metronomic Jon Lewis to restore order
