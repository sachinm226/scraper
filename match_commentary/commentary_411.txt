Pakistan were 140 for 1 in the 29th over. Honest. Shows just how well the openers, Hafeez and Jamshed, batted. Jamshed was in good nick, but Hafeez had a huge struggle initially. To his credit, he battled it out and prospered. And despite all the criticism he gets from fans, Mitchell Johnson coming out with the best economy rate among the frontline Australia bowlers, and also getting the first couple of breakthroughs. Four for Starc, who was pretty good during the latter part of the innings
Aina: "Maybe it does take a woman to sympathize with Misbah. As I see it, the way he bats and his way of thinking is largely influenced by all the frustrations he faced trying to make a career out of cricket. He does send Afridi and then Afridi fails and he needs to go back to his defensive shell. It is a vicious cycle really. Those winning runs in the last game were welcome!"

Joshwin: "Watching an ODI for the first time on TV played at Sharjah, the atmosphere reminds me of the games we play outside on the street as the sun is setting...absolutley amazing, wish i was playing there right now for either team."
 Innings Start
That is all from us for this game. Abhishek Purohit signing off. Cheers.
A proud Australia pose with the series trophy.
Michael Clarke: "Can't have been prouder of the guys. Maxwell is a wonderful talent, today is a great example of a team performance. The bowlers got us back after they were 100 for none. To be able to chase those runs against that attack is special. Starc has had a good series, he has hit the wicket hard, bowled with good pace. I don't want to take anything away from the other bowlers."
Misbah-ul-Haq: "The way we started, 15-20 runs short at the end. Credit to Australia the way they chased. Wasn't easy. Little bit of dew factor, outfield was also quicker in the second part of the game. Nasir Jamshed had a wonderful series, Shafiq and Azhar were positives, bowlers bowled well. I think after the game you can say we should have done this and that. All the time when we lose the game it is like this. Other bowlers are also wicket-takers. Probably, in hindsight, if I had continued with him [Ajmal], it could have been a different result."
Mitchell Starc is the Man of the Series. Starc: "It has been warm, sweaty and the dew factor as well. We wanted to come out and perform rather than just keep talking. Overall it has been a good tour."
Michael Hussey is the Man of the Match. Hussey: "It [heat] was not as bad as the last game in Abu Dhabi but it was still quite oppressive. Fantastic innings from Maxwell. To hit the ball like that on a pitch where the ball was dying was something. They have some great spinners. It is a very satisfying victory. It is up there among the toughest places to play cricket. No point complaining. It is the same for both teams."
We should be a seeing a lot of this Maxwell in the future. He hardly seems to be batting in the pressure of the No 7 position, and he was totally comfortably against Ajmal. You can say that about very few batsman in world cricket.
There were reservations expressed by Australia and their players' association on the extreme conditions for this series. But how well have their players responded. They threw themselves around in the field today, fast bowlers included.
Pakistan had their chances. They didn't review against Michael Hussey when he was plumb in front on 0. He turned the game around with Maxwell and Wade. Misbah took Ajmal off after he had bowled five overs for three wickets. Could he have given him another? Kamran missed a stumping off Wade, Azhar dropped Maxwell, and that is too many slip-ups against a side like Australia. And to top it all, Pakistan managed 244 after having been 140 for 1 in the 29th over
Tim: "Debut series in foreign conditions, backs to the wall against a master opponent and Maxwell comes through in fine style. A star is born today."
Kamran: "Criticize Bowden for a howler, not Pakistan for not opting for the review."
Salman: "Review has certainly played a big role but what about the fielding difference between the two sides. Australia would have been chasing much more if not for their fielding."
