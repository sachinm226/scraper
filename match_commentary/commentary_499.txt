Data
So, West Indies have failed to bat out their overs and have crawled to 105. They need a miracle, now, to get through to the semi-finals. Steven Smith and Mitchell Johnson bowled really well, and of course Dirk Nannes got the all-important wicket of Chris Gayle in the first over. Australia will chase 106 - join us shortly for their reply.
18.6;W;Watson to Benn, OUT gone, and that's the end of the innings. Watson goes full and straight and Benn can't get bat on that, it rattles his stumps;Sulieman Benn b Watson 9 (17m 16b 0x4 1x6) SR: 56.25;

12.3;W;Smith to Pollard, OUT gone! Lovely piece of bowling from Smith, he's turned the ball just past the bat of Pollard, who is trying to get forward and work through leg, and Haddin whips the bails off, no need for the third umpire there;Kieron Pollard st ?Haddin b Smith 13 (7m 14b 1x4 1x6) SR: 92.85;

15.5;1;Johnson to Miller, 1 run turned to leg for another single;
15.5;2nb;Johnson to Benn, (no ball) 1 run full toss, might have slipped out of the fingers there as it's ballooned up above waist height on the hips, worked to fine leg and called a no-ball;
15.4;1;Johnson to Miller, 1 run dropped. Another drive in the air, Clarke at cover dives to his left and misses the chance with his left hand, not an easy catch but Clarke would take those more often than he'd spill them;

14.2;2;Hussey to Miller, 2 runs shouts of 'catch it' as it's driven airily between mid off and cover;
14.1;W;Hussey to Sarwan, OUT and it goes from bad to worse for West Indies. Sarwan, the last of the specialist batsmen, has tried to clear the boundary at long-off but has simply found the man in the deep;Ramnaresh Sarwan c Warner b Hussey 26 (58m 31b 2x4 0x6) SR: 83.87;
11.6;6;Clarke to Pollard, SIX runs and this time Pollard goes for it, he's got down on one knee to slog sweep, he had no intention of keeping that ball down and lifted it high over midwicket for six;

9.3;1w;Johnson to Ramdin, 1 wide wrong line from Johnson this time, down leg and called wide;

8.5;1;Smith to Ramdin, 1 run pulled through midwicket;
8.4;W;Smith to Deonarine, OUT Deonarine's inclusion hasn't helped West Indies, he's gone for the glory shot over deep midwicket but straight to the man on the boundary;Narsingh Deonarine c Hussey b Smith 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
8.3;?;Smith to Deonarine, no run pushed to the off side;
8.2;1;Smith to Sarwan, 1 run tossed up and nudged to leg, where there's a big gap, the bowler Smith has to hare off and chase. He ends up at midwicket but is quick enough to keep it to a single;
8.1;2;Smith to Sarwan, 2 runs a bit too short, it's cut off the back foot through point;
7.6;1;Johnson to Sarwan, 1 run on the pads, Sarwan turns the ball behind square;
7.5;W;Johnson to Sarwan, OUT oh, that's extremely unfortunate. What a shocking piece of luck for Dwayne Bravo.

7.1;4;Johnson to Sarwan, FOUR runs Sarwan gets this one fine, and fine enough to reach the boundary. Johnson was aiming at leg stump and the batsman got a tickle on it to beat fine leg;

6.3;1;Smith to Sarwan, 1 run some turn again from Smith, Sarwan backs away and punches through cover;
6.2;?;Smith to Sarwan, no run oh, what's happened here? The ball turns past the bat, Sarwan appears to be well in his ground but Haddin whips off the bails and is confident. The third umpire is called for and indeed Sarwan is moving his back foot, well inside the crease, but it's impossible to tell if his foot is just raised or not. His spikes look like they're grounded, so he's safe.;
6.1;1;Smith to Bravo, 1 run clipped away off his pads to square leg;
5.6;?;Tait to Sarwan, no run almost through him, swinging in towards off stump and Sarwan gets a thick inside edge back onto his pads;

2.4;?;Nannes to Chanderpaul, no run nudged to cover, they can't find a run;
2.3;?;Nannes to Chanderpaul, no run pushed away to mid-on and they consider a quick single, but Johnson's quick pickup and throw sends them back;
2.2;2;Nannes to Chanderpaul, 2 runs fuller, straighter, and Chanderpaul flicks the ball to fine leg;

1.4;?;Tait to Chanderpaul, no run bouncer to reply! Chanderpaul gets out of the way of that one;

0.2;W;Nannes to Gayle, OUT oh dear! He's gone! Angled in and this ball doesn't swing at all, and rattles Gayle's stumps. The ball jagged back a little off the seam, Gayle has played the wrong line.;Chris Gayle b Nannes 4 (1m 2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200;
0.1;4;Nannes to Gayle, FOUR runs strong start from Gayle, he gets a half-volley and sends a punchy drive back past the bowler for four;
0.1;1w;Nannes to Gayle, 1 wide full, swinging and wide of off stump, too wide, says the umpire;

Hello and welcome to the last match of the Super Eights. It's West Indies and Australia in St Lucia, and the news from the middle is West Indies have won the toss and elected to bat.
Following Sri Lanka's win over India, the scenario is this: West Indies need to win by 24 runs to overtake Sri Lanka and qualify for the semi-finals. Theoretically, Australia can be knocked out - but only if they lose by 151 runs!
Australia are taking in an unchanged side, while West Indies have brought in Narsingh Deonarine and Nikita Miller to replace Wavell Hinds and Kemar Roach. No Roach - very interesting.
Now then, while you're getting ready for this game, remember that live audio is available for every match of the ICC World T20 on Cricket Radio. We're sorry but due to rights restrictions this service is not available to readers in India, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul are walking out to bat now. We're ready for the start. This is must-win stuff for the home team - how will Gayle lead the team? Let's find out. Dirk Nannes to open up for Australia.
 Innings Start
So that's the end of the Super Eights and it's the end of West Indies' tournament. Australia have won by six wickets and have finished on the top of Group F. They will meet Pakistan in one semi-final and Sri Lanka will meet England in the other. The win was really set up in the very first over of the game, when Dirk Nannes bowled Chris Gayle, who really had to be the man to step up for West Indies to get through. Brad Haddin enjoyed some time in the middle in the chase and will be better for it, having had a quiet tournament until now.
"We lost too many wickets at the top," says Chris Gayle. "Australia are playing good cricket. I wish them all the best, and I wish the ladies all the best in their semi-final."
"Hopefully come Thursday or Friday we can come out and continue this momentum," says Michael Clarke. "We want to play positive, aggressive cricket, and our fielding standards have been high."
Man of the Match is Steven Smith for his 3 for 20, he used the St Lucia pitch to his advantage, found some turn and was prepared to toss the ball up.
That's it from this match, and from the Super Eights. Thanks for joining us - be sure to tune in again for the two semi-finals, England v Sri Lanka on Thursday and Australia v Pakistan on Friday. Until then, bye for now.
16.3;5w;Gayle to White, 5 wide game over. That is an odd way to finish, Chris Gayle has bowled a quicker bouncer, deliberately, and the ball has sailed over White and Ramdin and away to the boundary;
16.2;W;Gayle to Haddin, OUT ah, Haddin won't be there to hit the winning runs, he's tried to force this one over the top and has only managed to get it to mid-on, where Sammy takes a straightforward chance;Brad Haddin c Sammy b Gayle 42 (46m 46b 5x4 0x6) SR: 91.3;
16.1;?;Gayle to Haddin, no run punched back to the bowler;
15.6;?;Taylor to Hussey, no run short ball, this time Hussey ducks and Ramdin takes it;
15.6;5w;Taylor to Hussey, 5 wide well, how that has reached the boundary is a mystery. It was a shortish ball that Hussey back away from, and somehow it's dipped on Ramdin and bounced under his gloves and away to the boundary;

15.4;?;Taylor to Haddin, no run cut to point, can't beat the field;

15.2;4;Taylor to Hussey, FOUR runs that's a brave and powerful shot, Taylor swings it in towards off stump and Hussey backs off and lifts the ball over extra cover, once bounce over the boundary. Had he missed that, he would certainly have been bowled;

12.5;?;Sammy to Hussey, no run driven to cover, can't beat the infield;
12.4;W;Sammy to Haddin, OUT oh, wonderful piece of fielding from Bravo! Haddin guided it off the face to short third man where Bravo dived to his right to make the stop, then fired the ball into the stumps to have Clarke short trying for the single. Great save and super throw, and perhaps a little bit of lazy running from Clarke, who didn't seem to be extending his bat properly;Michael Clarke run out (Bravo) 16 (31m 24b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
12.3;1;Sammy to Clarke, 1 run taken from well outside off by Clarke, who slaps the ball along the ground to long-on;
12.2;1;Sammy to Haddin, 1 run pulled to midwicket and they get a very sharp single;

10.3;?;Deonarine to Haddin, no run defended back to the bowler;
10.2;4;Deonarine to Haddin, FOUR runs better shot this time, shorter ball and Haddin pulls through square leg with power;
10.1;4;Deonarine to Haddin, FOUR runs not middled at all by Haddin, but he gets enough on it to find the boundary. It was on off stump, he looked for the drive over mid-off and the gap allowed it to trickle in to the boundary;
9.6;1;Miller to Haddin, 1 run worked away to leg once more;
9.5;1;Miller to Clarke, 1 run drifts down leg from over the wicket, again it's simply helped on its way to fine leg;

7.1;1;Bravo to Clarke, 1 run Clarke closes the face and works a single through square leg;
6.6;?;Miller to Haddin, no run quick work from Ramdin to take the bails off, and the third umpire is required. Miller from over the wicket turned the ball from outside leg past the edge of Haddin, who has backed way, but the batsman's foot was down, he's safe;
6.5;1;Miller to Clarke, 1 run tossed up on leg stump, Clarke drives to long-on;
6.4;?;Miller to Clarke, no run driven back to the bowler;

6.1;?;Miller to Clarke, no run drifting in to Clarke, who defends;
