After a long series of hearing Boonie and Beefy endlessly (in fairness, Beefy shut up around the middle of the Sydney Test), the Boonie doll has just been served up as a leg-side full toss to Andrew Miller and he smashed it ...straight into Andrew McGlashan who was writing a story and was unaware of other activity. We can report McGlashan's shoulder is fine and Boonie is in six pieces. Hopes he had been finally silenced were scotched when the remains of the base chirped in with "take that your majesty" a few second later.
A really tight last ten overs from Australia that might be the difference between the sides. England were again indebted to Paul Collingwood as well as Andrew Flintoff - the two added 97 for the fifth wicket - but Australia bowled well and fielded superbly. We'll be back at 7.15pm (0815GMT) for the second innings.
McGrath leads the team off to an amazing reception ... he turns just before he is engulfed by the pavilion and waves to all parts of the ground.

 Innings Start
Well, that's the end of a long series and for Australia a defeat which is not the end of the world but which does raise some questions so soon before the World Cup. And a sad home farewell for Glenn McGrath, and a losing one also for John Buchanan.
England have not become world-beaters overnight, but they will be confident heading to the Caribbean. A fortnight ago they were a shambles, now they look a unit.
Australia now head to New Zealand for three more ODIs starting next Friday in the Chappell-Hadlee series, games which are now more important than they were a week ago. If they lose that series then concerns will continue to grow.
From me, Martin Williamson, and from my fellow commentators Andrew Miller, Jenny Thompson, Will Luke and Andrew McGlashan, thank you for staying with us through the summer and for your kind comments. We are off to have a rest and will be back for the World Cup in a month's time.
Presentations These are, to quote Mark Taylor, in the "bowels of the Bradman Stand". Surely they are not in hiding?!
Player of the Finals Paul Collingwood. "Australia taught us a lesson in the Tests but it's good to end on a high."
Player of the Series Ricky Ponting.
Andrew Flintoff clutches an uber cheque ... makes the usual platitudes. "The lads in the dressing-room are cock-a-hoop. It's been a tough trip but to take something home is a great thrill. The past four games are as good as I've seen an England one-day side play. I'd like to thank Duncan Fletcher. he's taken knocks and it's nice to pay something back to him."
10.50pm England's dressing erupts into celebration as the announcement comes through confirming that they have won this match by 34 runs and with it the CB Series 2-0.
10.45pm The Barmy Army are singing in the rain but there is now a report that the umpires are saying there are 10 minutes to go before the game can be called off! Utter confusion and a PA announcement would be nice.
10.42pm It's got heavier ... I suspect that is it. England are not celebrating yet but the grins are unmistakable.
10.41pm Still raining, covers are on and the stands are emptying fast.
10.39pm This is bad for Australia. They should be 187 to win the game if it ends now. And if they are not playing in six minutes time (10.45pm/1145GMT) then it's all over. The countdown begins ...
It's raining again and the umpires are consulting ... the crowd boo and all that happens is that the ball is changed. Liam Plunkett into the attack for his last over. Loud boos around the ground as the umpires take the players off as it gets heavier.
