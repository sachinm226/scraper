Jacques with this gem: "If you offered Canada 211 at breakfast, they would have paid you for it!"
So after Hiral Patel surprised Australia with a free-spirited half-century upfront, they came back strongly through their fast bowlers, led by Lee who finished with four. Canada were 150 for 2 at one stage, but fell apart after that. Nitin Sundar will take you through the chase in 30 minutes. And I, Abhishek, will see you guys on Chatterbox.

9.3;4;Watson to Surkari, FOUR runs Surkari this time, looks to steer on that is very close to the body, and gets an edge that scoots wide of Haddin;
9.2;1;Watson to Patel, 1 run makes good ground and gets down to the other end with a desperate dive, the throw missed, and Hiral lives on to raise his bat for his half-century, it was hit down to mid off;
9.1;?;Watson to Patel, no run Hiral has one more swipe from the crease to one outside off stump, this time he misses;
8.6;1;Johnson to Patel, 1 run he gets away again, Watson at slip it is, very tough chance as it was dying to his right, he put in the dive but it seemed to bounce inches short as Hiral had another go, moves to 49 now;
8.5;4;Johnson to Patel, FOUR runs Hiral continues to swing merrily, and picks up boundaries all around, has a swing at one angled across him on a length, and the outside edge at Johnson's pace gives third man no chance;
8.4;1;Johnson to Surkari, 1 run similar delivery again, this time he shuffles across to work it away towards midwicket;
8.3;?;Johnson to Surkari, no run gets it to jag back in from short if a length, he rides the bounce to keep it down;

7.1;?;Watson to Patel, no run lumbers in and bowls a fuller one outside off stump, driven to mid off;

6.3;1;Johnson to Surkari, 1 run rides the bounce on one that jags back in to the body, and gets it wide of midwicket;
6.2;?;Johnson to Surkari, no run goes a touch wider outside off stump and he leaves it alone this time;
6.1;?;Johnson to Surkari, no run good delivery, that angle across the right hander close to off stump, good bounce too, he has a prod and is beaten;
5.6;6;Lee to Patel, SIX runs he finally decides to take on the Lee bouncer, and what a way to deal with it, not in a great position but hooks it away in the air, and over deep square leg, what a start this is from Canada;
5.5;?;Lee to Patel, no run gets away with this short delivery, it bounces high outside off stump, he was almost expecting it, neatly weaved out of the line when he saw it coming;
5.5;1w;Lee to Patel, 1 wide Lee continues to pound him with the bouncer, gets this one high enough for it to be called wide, Hiral got down underneath it;
5.4;?;Lee to Patel, no run gets the short delivery on target around off stump, he leaves it well alone, swaying out of harm's way;

5.3;1w;Lee to Patel, 1 wide fired wide down the leg side from back of a length;

4.5;1lb;Johnson to Patel, 1 leg bye bounces from short of a length but down the pads, off the hip to square leg;
4.4;6;Johnson to Patel, SIX runs another maximum, not where he intended it, but Canada will take it, Johnson continues to bowl it fuller and wider outside off stump, he had a big swing at it, and got it miles in the air, Lee at third man got into position, but it eluded him and went just over the ropes;
4.3;?;Johnson to Patel, no run Johnson beats him with a length ball that goes across him close to off stump, he goes for the drive and ends up playing inside the line;
4.2;4;Johnson to Patel, FOUR runs goes full and wide outside off stump, Hiral is in a mood to belt everything, bends the knee and slashes it past backward point, no chance for third man at all;
4.1;2;Johnson to Patel, 2 runs gets some shape off the seam in to the batsman from a length, he flicks it in the air to Hussey at square leg, who has a shy at the non-striker's stumps with the batsman already in the crease, and concedes an overthrow off the ricochet;
3.6;?;Lee to Surkari, no run 149.2 kph, Lee is charged after the wicket, bowls this one outside off stump and gets it to seam away, Surkari leaves it alone;
3.5;W;Lee to Davison, OUT that will do for Lee, and that will be the end of John Davison for one final time, the slow bouncer from Brett, got Davison in an awkward position as he tried to go for the hook, the ball took the glove and lobbed away to Haddin who pouched it;John Davison c ?Haddin b Lee 14 (19m 12b 3x4 0x6) SR: 116.66;
3.4;4;Lee to Davison, FOUR runs targets the stumps with a full length again, Davison stands in the crease and lifts it high over midwicket;
3.3;4;Lee to Davison, FOUR runs smashed again, this time he gets it in the gap as Lee continues to go full in search of movement that he is not finding currently, cover had no chance as it sped past him;
3.2;?;Lee to Davison, no run creamed off the front foot with lovely timing, but drives this full ball straight to Watson at short extra cover;
3.1;?;Lee to Davison, no run goes for a swipe at this back of a length ball outside off stump, and Lee gets the outside edge, but it falls way short of Haddin;
2.6;?;Tait to Patel, no run goes for the slash to a short and wide delivery, Tait is fortunate to get away with it as he misses, not much footwork did Hiral in;
2.5;1;Tait to Davison, 1 run bowls one wide outside off stump on a length, and he goes down on the knee to cut it away to third man;
2.4;?;Tait to Davison, no run Davison tries to get in to the act now, goes for the pull off one leg to a bouncer that is miles outside off stump, and missed;
2.3;1;Tait to Patel, 1 run back of a length and bounces awkwardly, but he gets outside the line to work it away to fine leg;
2.3;1w;Tait to Patel, 1 wide 142.6 kph, Tait has lost his radar, another one goes marginally down the leg side with the angle, that is enough for him to concede the wide in this format;
2.3;1w;Tait to Patel, 1 wide Tait sprays it down the leg side, trying to go for the bouncer in to the body;
2.2;6;Tait to Patel, SIX runs my goodness, that is murdered, Shaun Tait bowls one at 148.5 kph, but Hiral seems to be enjoying this battle, stays on the crease and thumps it over extra cover, one leg in the air in cavalier fashion as he does that, and the connection is so neat it goes all the way;
2.1;1;Tait to Davison, 1 run goes for the yorker right away, dug out in to the off side for a single;
1.6;2;Lee to Patel, 2 runs punched in the air off the back foot, but again in the gap past extra cover, and Canada are fairly racing away here;
1.5;4;Lee to Patel, FOUR runs shot, this is some start from Canada, as fine a cover drive as any, gets front foot out and shows the full face of the bat to get it in the gap, that is enough on this outfield;
1.4;2;Lee to Patel, 2 runs Lee has had enough of being cut, gets him to ungainly fend a bouncer that takes off, three fielders hare after it as it goes high over the keeper's head, one of them is keeper, one is slip, one is fine leg who manages to pull it back in, and there is a fourth fielder waiting inside the ropes to throw the ball back, as the earlier three have crossed the ropes, phew;
1.3;4;Lee to Patel, FOUR runs 144.5 kph, he is alternating between connecting and missing, this time he delays the shot, goes deep in the crease and cuts it past backward point for another boundary;
1.2;?;Lee to Patel, no run 143.2 kph short and again some width, this time there is more effort from Lee, and he gets much more bounce, no footwork from Hiral who tries to have a swing from the crease, and is beaten;
1.1;4;Lee to Patel, FOUR runs 139.9 kph, shrt and bit of width, he latches on to it in an instant, and cuts it superbly between cover and point;
0.6;?;Tait to Davison, no run goes for a cover drive from the crease, is miles away from the length ball that leaves him a shade;
0.5;4;Tait to Davison, FOUR runs Tait bowls a pacy full delivery on the pads, dropped by Michael Hussey at square leg as it is flicked emphatically off the toes, it was going quickly over him, he managed to get two hands to it but only parried it away to the boundary;
0.4;?;Tait to Davison, no run 139.5 kph bouncer, Davison cannot get it away, probably expecting the fuller one, tried to upper cut it but missed;
0.4;1nb;Tait to Davison, (no ball) a bit away from off stump this time, Davison came forward and went for a loose drive, the ball moved away a shade to beat him, Tait has overstepped to allow a free hit;
0.3;1;Tait to Patel, 1 run 146 kph ripping yorker, Tait is right on the money here, he is pegged on the back foot, somehow manages to survive, jabs it away off the inside edge to fine leg;
0.2;?;Tait to Patel, no run ooh, almost had him there, very full on leg stump, he chose to go on the back foot, and had a swipe across the line, the leading edge fell short of mid off;
0.1;?;Tait to Patel, no run 143.6 kph right away, and it takes off from short of a good length just outside off stump, he has a poke at it, and gets bat out of the way belatedly as it zips past him;

All set for the game to begin, John Davison, walks out for the last time in Canada colours, along with Hiral Patel. Tait, not Lee, it will be with the new ball.
2.20 pm Out come the players for the national anthems. O Canada first, to be followed by Advance Australia Fair.
Vinoth: "@Sameer: You missed one. Davison!!! He is going to play his last match today. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate him as well!"
Simon: "I wouldn't be surprised if Ponting opened the bowling with Smith and Krejza, just so Canada actually score a decent total to bat against. Actually I would be surprised. Punter will probably go out there aiming to bowl Canada out for 100, which won't help us in the long run."
Okakaboka: "The same eleven? Geez, the Australians are asking for trouble. What happens WHEN Tait breaks down or Krejza increases his number of half-trackers?"
Sameer: "Before the match begins, I would like to congratulate 2 players especially from Canada team: Bagai and Balaji. These 2 guys have shown never say die approach throughout the tournamment and really fought well. Winning or Losing is another story, But to participate and try you best is what counts!!! Have a good final game for this WC."
Kiran: "Wouldn't be surprised if Ponting used up Steve Smith's and Jason Krejza's 10 if the pace attack doesn't go so well. Also wouldn't mind seeing a bit of Steve, considering he's in my fantasy. Ponting, heed my words. :D"
Brave decision from Bagai to have a bat against the pace of Lee, Tait and Johnson, knowing there is a strong chance that things could unravel quickly for Canada's batsmen.
2 pm Toss: Ashish Bagai wins it and Canada will have a bat.
Bagai: "Bangalore is not as hot as Mumbai was. It's our last game, so hoping for the best." You think Bagai's boys can cause an upset today? Let us know.
Ponting: "Couple of long breaks between games. We have got used to the conditions here now. Important to start playing our best cricket now. I am not one for tinkering the order too much. We are going with the same team that has played the first four games." Shaun Tait is playing that means. Is he in your Fantasy XIs? Remember, it's not too late to enter your teams, there are some cool Canon cameras to be won just for the knockout stage.
1.55 pm Lovely bright day in Bangalore. Ravi Shastri says the pitch has a dry look, but there will not be that much help for spinners. Ball expected to come on to the bat nicely, says Shastri. Win toss, and bat first. As if you expected Ricky to do anything else if he calls correctly.
There is an interesting sub-plot to this encounter that could pit Jason Krejza against his coach at the Australian Centre of Excellence, John Davison, who has announced his retirement. More on the build-up in the preview by Sriram Veera.
Welcome to our coverage of the Group A match between Australia and Canada in Bangalore. Australia's famed pace attack could not bowl out Kenya at this ground a few days ago, in fact they only managed three wickets between them. Ricky Ponting would want a much improved show today from his quick men, despite the fact that Shaun Tait could get a rest. What do you think the Playing XIs could be?
 Innings Start
That winds up our coverage for today. On behalf of Abhishek and the rest of the crew, this is Nitin Sundar signing off. Do join us for the Chennai cracker tomorrow, it is England v Windies. Cheers!
Well, it started well for Canada, but Australia gradually took control and cantered home. Here's George Binoy's bulletin telling you how it all happened.
Presentations:
Watson is Man of the Match: "It was nice to come out good in the end and hit a few right out of the middle. Canadians bowled pretty straight, they bowled well with the new ball and the wicket was two paced. It was nice to develop the partnership with Haddin. We have been having a week between some of our games, so nice to get some back to back games now."
Ponting: "Things went not too bad, their top four or five batted really well, but our batsmen were outstanding. We haven't fully been tested yet, we will be by Pakistan in Colombo and we look forward to it. You could say I am due, would have been nice to be not out, but may be I am saving it up for the big games."
Bagai: "The experience has been phenomenal, the young guys will take a lot from this. Our bowlers were fantastic through the tournament, but the batsmen were poor in the first half. Some young guys got self belief out of the World Cup - Hansra, Patel. We came here looking to win, and laid a good platform, but inexperience let us down."
Faisal: "What does it take to beat Australia in the World Cup? ....... "Pakistan". Well, lets hope it is a cracker!
Kamal: "Another one sided in Group A.. Is it a calm before storm considering England would be playing tmrw?"
What does it take to beat Australia in the World Cup? Sigh! They now top the table.
Satish: "Ponting's reflexes are not like before. He should cut back on that pull shot."
That's right Satish. You echoed George Binoy's opinions, he still recalls nightmares from 2003 when Ponting pulverised India with the pull shot.
Phil: "That's why Ponting do not want the Associates to play in the World Cup - he keeps getting out against them." Haha!
34.6;1w;Osinde to White, 1 wide Osinde denies White the pleasure of hitting the winning run by landing a bouncer in his own half. Bowden signals wide, and that's the end of Canada's World Cup campaign.;
34.5;4;Osinde to White, FOUR runs White levels the scores with a smooth backfoot cover drive. He waits on the back foot to a short of length ball and punches it cleanly through the cordon;
34.4;?;Osinde to White, no run back of a length on off stump, played off the back foot into the off side;
34.3;?;Osinde to White, no run White gingerly pokes out to the off side;
34.2;W;Osinde to Ponting, OUT a bad day for Ponting comes to a forgettable end. Hide the TVs, is the joke doing the rounds. His bowlers struggled to bowl out Canada. Steve Smith nearly muffed a catch that was his. And now he's not got the batting practice he wanted. And he's again perished to the short ball. Late on the pull, pops it up to square leg meekly. A catch for Davison now, this is not as bad way to retire.;Ricky Ponting c Davison b Osinde 7 (30m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 46.66;
34.1;?;Osinde to Ponting, no run short of a length outside off, Ponting opens the face and defends to the off side;
33.6;1;Balaji Rao to Ponting, 1 run Ponting gets a single as well, cutting a short ball into the covers;
33.5;1;Balaji Rao to Clarke, 1 run too short and wide, Clarke cuts away with the spin through the covers for one more;
33.4;4;Balaji Rao to Clarke, FOUR runs top shot from Clarke, skips out like a beaver, gets to the pitch and drives it right back past Rao and all the way to the straight boundary.;
33.3;?;Balaji Rao to Clarke, no run looped up on middle and leg, Clarke defends off the front foot;
33.2;2;Balaji Rao to Clarke, 2 runs over-pitched on off, Clarke drives into the covers for one more;
33.1;1;Balaji Rao to Ponting, 1 run loopy on the pads, Ponting deflects backward of square for one;
32.6;?;Osinde to Clarke, no run back of a length on off stump, solidly defended into the covers as Ponting and Clarke get what little batting practice they can.;
32.6;1w;Osinde to Clarke, 1 wide too wide down the leg side and called;
32.5;1;Osinde to Ponting, 1 run short again, Ponting quietly taps to the leg side for a single;
32.4;1;Osinde to Clarke, 1 run short ball ends on the hips, Clarke works it to square leg for one;
32.3;?;Osinde to Clarke, no run length ball on off stump, Clarke cuts straight into the ground and into point's hands;
32.2;1;Osinde to Ponting, 1 run short ball, comes on slowly at 128 kph and Ponting controls the pull to deep midwicket;
32.1;?;Osinde to Ponting, no run back of a length outside off, Ponting hangs back and defends to the off side;
31.6;?;Baidwan to Clarke, no run short of a length on middle and off, defended down the track and that will be drinks. If Watto and Haddin hadn't got out, this game would have ended by now.;
31.5;?;Baidwan to Clarke, no run short and sitting up just outside off, Clarke cuts well but straight to point;
31.4;?;Baidwan to Clarke, no run short of a length outside off from Baidwan, Clarke defends down the track;
31.3;?;Baidwan to Clarke, no run whoa, steep bouncer that, and Clarke does well to pull out of the pull shot as it flies past him to the keeper;
31.2;1;Baidwan to Ponting, 1 run over-pitched on the stumps, Ponting gets a single with a drive to the left of mid on, who fields the ball this time;
31.1;?;Baidwan to Ponting, no run short of a length on off stump, Ponting defends solidly to the off side;
30.6;?;Osinde to Clarke, no run good bouncer outside off, Clarke drops his wrists in a hurry to let it go;
30.5;4;Osinde to Clarke, FOUR runs Canada aren't the best fielding side in this World Cup. Hansra the culprit again at mid on, as Clarke drives a length ball fluently down the ground. Hansra moves slowly and puts it a pointless dive as the ball chugs past;
30.4;?;Osinde to Clarke, no run short of a length outside off, and he lets it go through to the keeper;
30.3;?;Osinde to Clarke, no run Clarke drives wide of mid off, and thinks of a single but the fielder gets across quickly;
30.2;?;Osinde to Clarke, no run back of a length on middle and off, Clarke punches to mid on;
30.1;4;Osinde to Clarke, FOUR runs short and wide outside off, Clarke is away with a sparkling cut in front of square. Take that, Osinde.;
29.6;?;Baidwan to Ponting, no run fuller ball on off stump, driven fluently straight to mid off.;
29.5;?;Baidwan to Ponting, no run slow bouncer, Ponting pulls out of the pull shot late and it is through to Bagai;
29.4;?;Baidwan to Ponting, no run length ball on the stumps, punched straight to mid on;
29.3;W;Baidwan to Watson, OUT Watson has missed his 100 too. This immense compulsion to hit sixes has finally cost him his wicket. He wanted to pull this. It wasn't straight enough. He still wanted to pull this. It wasn't short enough. He still wanted to pull this. Ends up trying to whack it over long on, but finds the man in the deep.;Shane Watson c Osinde b Baidwan 94 (129m 90b 9x4 4x6) SR: 104.44;
29.2;1;Baidwan to Ponting, 1 run fuller on off, he still plays from the crease to third man for a single;
29.1;?;Baidwan to Ponting, no run after ages, a batsman beaten outside off. Back of a length ball outside off, Ponting struts into a forward defensive prod and misses;
28.6;1;Davison to Ponting, 1 run tossed up outside off, driven into the covers for one;
28.5;W;Davison to Haddin, OUT ah, finally a wicket. Davison has struck in his last game with a flat ball landing on leg and turning further down. Haddin tickles it along into Bagai's gloves. He's missed a 100 here.;Brad Haddin c ?Bagai b Davison 88 (124m 84b 11x4 2x6) SR: 104.76;
28.4;1;Davison to Watson, 1 run similar delivery to Watson, who flicks to the leg side for one more;
28.3;1;Davison to Haddin, 1 run Davison wisely spears down the leg side and Haddin nudges a single behind square;
28.2;6;Davison to Haddin, SIX runs majestic from Haddin. Jumps out to the flight of Davison's offie and tees off down the ground for another six. They are just flying in all directions now.;
28.1;4;Davison to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin knows his 100 is under threat, so he gets into the act. Full toss on off stump, he just eases it gracefully to midwicket for four;
27.6;4;Patel to Watson, FOUR runs bosh again, this is ending in a hurry. Watson reaches out to a loopy ball on the stumps and hits another straight four;
27.5;4;Patel to Watson, FOUR runs Hiral Patel's day is ending the way it began. Unfortunately, he's on the other side now. Shorter ball, Watson waits and dumps it straight back down the ground.;
27.4;4;Patel to Watson, FOUR runs fuller from Patel, Watson can't quite get under it, so he just gets four instead of six, with a forced pull just over midwicket;
27.3;6;Patel to Watson, SIX runs ok, this is just pure violence. R rated stuff. These spinners don't stand a chance. Hiral meekly lands one on the leg stump and Watson smashes the leather off it as it sails over midwicket.;
27.2;1;Patel to Haddin, 1 run now he pats into the covers for a single;
27.1;?;Patel to Haddin, no run back of a length on off stump, Haddin can't force the ball into the off side;
26.6;6;Davison to Watson, SIX runs he's hitting them from both ends now. Davison does his bit by flighting gently on off stump, Watson reaches across to the pitch and just tees off smoothly. Ernie Els would have been proud of the shot. Lands a mile away in the stands at long on. That's the longest six of the tournament! 104 m. Usain Bolt would have taken over 9.72 seconds to get there. Watson did it slightly sooner.;
26.5;?;Davison to Watson, no run flat outside off, Watson stays content to defend from the crease;
26.4;?;Davison to Watson, no run speared into the pads, Watson nurdles to short fine leg;
26.3;1;Davison to Haddin, 1 run Haddin chips out to the flight and pushes a single to mid on;
26.2;1;Davison to Watson, 1 run Watto leans out to a flighted ball on off and dinks a single to cover.;
26.1;1;Davison to Haddin, 1 run Haddin does the wise thing, pushing a single down the ground and handing it to Watto.;
25.6;6;Balaji Rao to Watson, SIX runs oh boy, Watson is sure covering some real estate with his savage slog sweeps. This one is fuller, and his blast just keeps going, and going, and going. 99 metres by the time it decides to land over wide long on. Rao has been routed. Its the second biggest six of the World Cup after KOB against England.;
25.5;?;Balaji Rao to Watson, no run short and wide, Rao's been a letdown so far, Watson cuts fiercely to cover;
25.4;?;Balaji Rao to Watson, no run Watson misses the slog sweep this time, full and a foot wide outside off, he swipes and misses;
25.3;?;Balaji Rao to Watson, no run over-pitched on off stump, defended with the spin into the covers;
25.2;6;Balaji Rao to Watson, SIX runs Watson has hit that into MG Road. Almost. Rao lands this really short, Watson gets those biceps behind it and brutalises it over midwicket. Menacingly efficient. 94 metres it travels, and the crowd is reluctant to return the ball.;
25.1;?;Balaji Rao to Watson, no run loopy on middle and off, breaking away and defended to the off side;
24.6;?;Baidwan to Haddin, no run legcutter on off stump, Haddin hangs on the crease and dabs it square.;
24.5;1;Baidwan to Watson, 1 run slower ball on off stump, Watson waits and clips to long on for a single;
24.4;1;Baidwan to Haddin, 1 run full toss on leg stump, Haddin drives fluidly to mid off for one more;
24.3;?;Baidwan to Haddin, no run full delivery just outside off, Haddin make contact with the steer;
24.2;1;Baidwan to Watson, 1 run Watson gets one on the pads and hoicks it along to deep backward square leg for one;
24.1;1;Baidwan to Haddin, 1 run Haddin again tries to move away and drill a length ball down the ground. Single to long on;
23.6;1;Cheema to Haddin, 1 run full and on off stump, Haddin clips to square leg for a single;
23.5;4;Cheema to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin's making merry while the lights shine. Cheema slides one onto the pads, and Haddin easily whips through backward square leg. Australia are charging to a win here.;
23.4;4;Cheema to Haddin, FOUR runs this is pretty smart Powerplay batting. The field is in on the off side, Haddin waits for the slower ball to come along and then slaps it on the up over the covers.;
23.3;?;Cheema to Haddin, no run he's really looking for the boundary, this time he moves back and to the off side, lining Cheema up for the leg side heave, but can't get it past midwicket;
23.2;?;Cheema to Haddin, no run Haddin backs away and tries to cut, but can't get it away past point;
23.1;4;Cheema to Haddin, FOUR runs boy, how many edges have we seen from Australia tonight? Cheema again slips in the off cutter, Haddin plays the cut and gets the inside egde, which finds a way between the stumps and the keeper. Four more to fine leg;
22.6;4;Baidwan to Watson, FOUR runs Watson's completely missed the slower ball, he plays the leg side swipe in the 2007 edition of the World Cup, the ball comes in present tense, four years later. It goes off something, down to third man for four. It's been that kind of evening for Canada.;
22.5;1;Baidwan to Haddin, 1 run back of a length on the pads, worked through midwicket for one more;
22.4;1;Baidwan to Watson, 1 run Watson has 50 now, digging out a full delivery outside off with a forced cover drive for one;
22.3;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run Watson looks to nudge off the pads to the leg side but finds backward square leg;
22.2;1;Baidwan to Haddin, 1 run right, Haddin is going after the bowling here. Slow bouncer goes awry, sits up and asks to be hammered, he thumps it to deep backward square leg. Thankfully there's a fielder there.;
22.1;1;Baidwan to Watson, 1 run length ball comes into Watson's pads and he clips it backward of square for a single;
21.6;4;Osinde to Haddin, FOUR runs that's as delicate as they come. Inventive, innovative and industrious. Length ball on off stump, not the kind you steer, but that's just what Haddin does, opening the face and lofting it over the covers. Quite unusual, and well done.;
21.5;4;Osinde to Haddin, FOUR runs fifty to Haddin, he's had his chances and he's made use of them. Over-pitched ball from Osinde, coming in with the angle and Haddin lofts it over wide mid on with a clean swipe of the bat.;
21.4;1;Osinde to Watson, 1 run Watson gets another single to third man, steering one from outside off safely;
21.3;?;Osinde to Watson, no run slower ball outside off, Watson dabs it backward of point and thinks of a single but the fielder covers ground quickly;
21.2;1;Osinde to Haddin, 1 run full delivery on the stumps, punched solidly to mid on for a single;
21.1;2;Osinde to Haddin, 2 runs back of a length outside off, some really lazy fielding at third man from Hansra allows Haddin a couple as he steers. Even a direct hit would have done the job.;
20.6;1;Baidwan to Haddin, 1 run Haddin chips out this time and nurdles fine off the pads to retain strike;
20.5;?;Baidwan to Haddin, no run Haddin moves to the leg side, Baidwan sees him and lands a slow offcutter outside off, forcing Haddin to steer carefully into the covers;
20.4;1;Baidwan to Watson, 1 run straight ball outside off, Watson guides cautiously to third man for a single;
20.3;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run hmm, nifty offcutter from Baidwan, Watson plays all over it and is struck in front of middle and leg. It was surely going further down.;
20.2;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run back of a length outside off, Watson gets forward and across to play it into the covers;
20.1;2;Baidwan to Watson, 2 runs good length on off stump, punched straight to long on and Hansra is really slow to cover it, they get a couple;
19.6;2;Balaji Rao to Haddin, 2 runs short this time, Haddin prances back and cuts into the covers for one;
19.5;6;Balaji Rao to Haddin, SIX runs nicely done Haddin. When he times the ball, there are few to beat him. Tossed up on middle and off, he leans out and dumps it clean and straight over mid on. The ball lands on the rope and comes back in. For the first time ever, I'm seeing a six being given the ball did not clear the ropes.;
19.4;?;Balaji Rao to Haddin, no run tossed up on off stump, Haddin leans out to drive into the covers;
19.3;?;Balaji Rao to Haddin, no run huge lbw appeal now, Haddin squared up by sharp spin from middle and leg, and it hits in front of off. Not given and not reviewed.;
19.2;?;Balaji Rao to Haddin, no run not really sure how that did not hit the stumps. Rao finally flights one on middle and leg and gets it to break away nicely. Haddin plays the ugliest of slog sweep, the kind that even Steve Waugh wouldn't appreciate, and he misses. The ball bounces a mile and hence misses the stumps. Haddin dragged the back foot out as he played that shot. Bagai doesn't gather cleanly and breaks the stumps without the ball in his gloves. Did the ball land on the stumps? Did the bails come off before the ball hit the stumps? Too much doubt. Haddin, somehow, survives.;
19.1;1;Balaji Rao to Watson, 1 run over-pitched on leg stump, driven down the ground for one;
18.6;1;Davison to Watson, 1 run Watson finally gets the single down the track;
18.5;?;Davison to Watson, no run full on middle, Watson on-drives past mid on, but still can't get the single;
18.4;?;Davison to Watson, no run works this one with the turn to square leg;
18.3;?;Davison to Watson, no run breaks in from outside off, Watson leans out into a dour defensive shot;
18.2;1;Davison to Haddin, 1 run speared in on middle and turning in, Haddin works it to square leg;
18.1;?;Davison to Haddin, no run Haddin eases a fullish ball to midwicket and thinks of one, but Watson isn't interested;
17.6;1;Balaji Rao to Haddin, 1 run Haddin retains strike with a steer to short third man for one more;
17.5;?;Balaji Rao to Haddin, no run short ball, looks to cut and plays it without timing to the covers;
17.4;?;Balaji Rao to Haddin, no run tossed up on leg, Haddin stays back and defends;
17.3;1lb;Balaji Rao to Watson, 1 leg bye sprays this down the leg side, Watto gets a single as he looks to flick. It goes fine off the pad.;
17.2;?;Balaji Rao to Watson, no run leans out to a flighted ball, and defends to the offside off the outer half of the bat;
17.1;?;Balaji Rao to Watson, no run loopy but not too full on off, Watson defends down the track;
16.6;1;Davison to Watson, 1 run Watson pushes another single down the ground. Australia are doing this in singles.;
16.5;1;Davison to Haddin, 1 run Haddin covers the line of an offie turning in and works it to the leg side for one;
16.4;1;Davison to Watson, 1 run shortish ball, Watson is late on the pull and can't get it away for more than a single;
16.3;1;Davison to Haddin, 1 run Haddin leans out to drive a full ball outside off into the covers for a single;
16.2;?;Davison to Haddin, no run short of a length on the pads, nudged away to the leg side for a single;
16.1;1;Davison to Watson, 1 run tossed up and turning in, worked off the front foot to the leg side;
15.6;2;Balaji Rao to Haddin, 2 runs Rao's bowling too many poor balls here, this one is short and wide and turning away. Haddin cuts it away past point for a couple more.;
15.5;?;Balaji Rao to Haddin, no run over-pitched on leg stump, played down the track;
15.4;1;Balaji Rao to Watson, 1 run over-pitched on the lag stump, worked to the leg side carefully;
15.3;1;Balaji Rao to Haddin, 1 run strays onto the pads this time, Haddin nudges a single backward of square;
15.2;?;Balaji Rao to Haddin, no run turning away from middle and off, steered carefully into the covers off the back foot;
15.1;1;Balaji Rao to Watson, 1 run Rao keeps it on the pads all the time, Watto works it off the back foot to square leg for one;
14.6;1;Cheema to Watson, 1 run ends the over by steering a single into the covers;
14.5;4;Cheema to Watson, FOUR runs that's a Watson copyright. Not too short, coming in with the angle, Watson sets up a solid base and whacks the pull well in front of square. Natural, original and effective - the Watto pull.;
14.4;?;Cheema to Watson, no run fuller and straighter on off stump, Watson defends solidly into the off side;
14.3;1;Cheema to Haddin, 1 run Haddin has another go, back of a length delivery coming into him and he under-edges the pull past leg stump. The Aussies want to stamp their authority but Canada are not letting them off.;
14.2;?;Cheema to Haddin, no run shifts the line to outside off, Haddin leans into the check-drive and gets it to mid off;
14.1;?;Cheema to Haddin, no run short of a length and coming in with the angle, Haddin drives off the back foot to midwicket;
13.6;1;Balaji Rao to Haddin, 1 run short again on leg stump, Haddin guides the pull to deep midwicket for one;
13.5;1;Balaji Rao to Watson, 1 run boy, he's bowling quite a few half-trackers, but this one comes on fast to Watson before he can really pack a punch into the pull shot.;
13.4;1;Balaji Rao to Haddin, 1 run too short, Haddin rocks back and cracks the cut in front of point for a single;
13.3;?;Balaji Rao to Haddin, no run good line, lands on leg and breaks away. Haddin hangs back and defends down the track;
13.2;?;Balaji Rao to Haddin, no run nice searching loopy delivery outside off, Haddin prods without getting across and gets it to the leg side off the inner edge;
13.1;1;Balaji Rao to Watson, 1 run Rao lands this on leg stump, and Watson turns it off the pads for a single;
12.6;1;Cheema to Watson, 1 run slower ball goes wrong, dawdles in at 112 kph, full and wide outside off. Watson just quietly drives into the covers for a single;
12.5;?;Cheema to Watson, no run nips in off the seam again, Watson forces a defensive shot from the crease down the track;
12.4;1;Cheema to Haddin, 1 run Haddin quietly dabs another single to third man as Cheema keeps it short of a length outside off;
12.3;1;Cheema to Watson, 1 run fuller on off at a friendly pace, Watson on-drives to long on for a single;
12.2;?;Cheema to Watson, no run offcutter comes in from back of a length, Watson is cramped for room as he tries to steer, and misses to make contact;
12.1;1;Cheema to Haddin, 1 run Haddin steers a single to third man;
11.6;4;Balaji Rao to Watson, FOUR runs oho, Canada are letting the Australians get away here. Rao sends down the third half-tracker of the over, Watson sets himself up and pulls it high. Nitish at deep midwicket seemed to move slowly to his right. I think he didn't pick it at all. The ball went not more than two feet away from where he was.;
11.5;?;Balaji Rao to Watson, no run straighter ball, Watson covers the line and defends down the track;
11.4;?;Balaji Rao to Watson, no run aha, the bait outside off, looped up generously and inviting the off-drive. Watson has a go and it goes past the edge;
11.3;?;Balaji Rao to Watson, no run better length, lands this outside off and gets it to break away. Watson covers the line and defends;
11.2;1;Balaji Rao to Haddin, 1 run another short ball, no dew in Bangalore, but he's yet to get a grip on the ball. Haddin pulls fine for a single;
11.1;1;Balaji Rao to Watson, 1 run ah, he drops the first one too short and Watson pulls fiercely to deep midwicket for one;
10.6;1;Osinde to Watson, 1 run Osinde needs a break. Over-pitched outside leg, and Watson flicks to deep square leg for a single;
10.5;?;Osinde to Watson, no run full and straight this time, Watson inside edges the on-drive to wide mid on;
10.4;4;Osinde to Watson, FOUR runs ah, I take that back. Watson times one perfectly as a tiring Osinde sprays it on the pads. Not full enough for the flick, but Watson just gets the bat around with a delicate turn of the wrists and it runs away between mid on and midwicket;
10.3;?;Osinde to Watson, no run Watson's not timing them at all. For once Osinde over-pitched on the stumps, and Watson inside edges the drive onto the pads and down the track.;
10.2;?;Osinde to Watson, no run shortish ball on off stump, Haddin hops up to defend to the off side;
10.1;1;Osinde to Haddin, 1 run angles into the pads, Haddin flicks straight to midwcket without timing and they have another single;
9.6;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run that's a maiden from Baidwan, Watson defends calmly to the off side;
9.5;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run short, but not a half-tracker. Watson looks to pull and can't time it.;
9.4;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run Watson is being kept on a right leash. Baidwan keeps landing them short of a length and Watson is looking to see away this opening burst;
9.3;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run angles into the pads, Watsom works the drive to mid on after coming across the stumps.;
9.2;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run fullish length on off stump, driven out to mid off. Another dot delivery.;
9.1;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run dainty inducker, Watson covers the line and punches past the bowler. Haddin strays out of the crease but is wisely sent back in time.;
8.6;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run shortens the length to end the over, Haddin feels from the crease and manages to defend to the off side.;
8.5;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run heavy ball on middle and off, Haddin hops back to ride the bounce and defends to the leg side as it comes at 135 kph;
8.4;1;Osinde to Watson, 1 run good delivery, another inducking yorker squeezing into Watson's pads and he squeezes it down to backward square leg;
8.3;?;Osinde to Watson, no run another huge appeal, this one seemed to be heading down the leg side. Boy, Bagai takes for ever to decide whether he should review it. This time, he does. It's a full delivery, swooping into the line of leg stump as Watson tries to work it to the leg side without much feet movement. Oh, replays say he's nicked it. A review wasted now. Canada are not playing this right.;
8.2;?;Osinde to Watson, no run back of a length on off stump, and defended to the off side;
8.1;2;Osinde to Watson, 2 runs Watto runs like the wind and gets two, glancing off the pads to deep backward square leg and charging back before the throw can be deflected onto the stumps by Bagai;
7.6;?;Baidwan to Haddin, no run if he did not edge that, Haddin might have escaped again. Inducker from back of a length, cramps him into another hoicked pull across the line. Umpire Saheba turns down the appeal, Baidwan wants a review. Bagai thinks long and hard, and chooses not to refer it. The ball came in and thudded into the pads in front of middle and off. Middle and leg were being hit and replays confirm that did not get an inside edge. Canada should have reviewed it!;
7.5;?;Baidwan to Haddin, no run back of a length on off stump and punched confidently into the covers;
7.4;?;Baidwan to Haddin, no run fuller length to Haddin who plays an iffy, all-over-the-shop kind of stroke down the ground without moving the feet. He makes almost no contact;
7.3;1;Baidwan to Watson, 1 run short of a length again on middle stump, worked around the pads to the leg side;
7.2;4;Baidwan to Watson, FOUR runs sublime timing from Watson, just plonks the front foot across and flows through the line. He probably was early on the shot, but he middled it really well. What looked like a check drive ended as a lofted boundary to long on;
7.1;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run short of a length and angling into Watson who defends to the leg side from the crease;
6.6;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run he ends the over by pushing a length ball into the off side. Canada need some luck here.;
6.5;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run another close shave, Haddin's sporting a smooth, red chin now. Short ball coming in from outside off, Haddin goes for a loose pull and under-edges it. The ball lands near off stump, evaluates its options and then chooses to bounce over the furniture and go away.;
6.4;4;Osinde to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin's manufactured another boundary, not sure what he was trying to do as he moved his front foot away to the leg side, but he ended up carving it pretty well inside out over the covers.;
6.3;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run this one keeps low, Haddin was stuck on the back foot and did well to bring the bat down at the last moment and defend to the leg side;
6.2;1;Osinde to Watson, 1 run whoa, tight single and he just makes it. Watson dinks a short ball on the pads to mid on and takes off. Hiral runs in from midwicket and has the left-arm pick up and throw advantage. He misses though, as Watson hurries in.;
6.1;?;Osinde to Watson, no run over-pitched on off stump, Watto drives without timing to mid on;
5.6;?;Baidwan to Haddin, no run Haddin defends the final delivery from the crease into the covers;
5.5;1;Baidwan to Watson, 1 run straighter this time in compensation, Watson pushes to mid on for a single;
5.4;4;Baidwan to Watson, FOUR runs the cheek from Watson. He's played the late cut to a seamer, despite not having any room, and knowing that first slip is not around any more. Expertly done, the upper flick of the wrists just as the ball came on, and another dismaying boundary through third man;
5.3;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run straighter this time, bordering on middle and off as Watson covers the line to defend;
5.2;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run back of a length is how Baidwan's got 12 World Cup wickets and he sticks to the plan. Watson again plays calmly into the covers;
5.1;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run short of a length on off stump, Watson check drives to the off side;
4.6;4;Osinde to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin has luck now, squared up by another peachy legcutter from Osinde, he gets the outside edge straight to where second slip would have been. Alas, the second slip isn't there any more and it is down to third man for four;
4.5;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run top bowling from Osinde, he's bowling to the field. Haddin again forces the steer without timing towards point.;
4.4;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run closer to the stumps, but Haddin stays put on the back foot to defend into the off side;
4.3;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run that's more like it, Osinde lands it back of a length on off stump and gets it to go away. Haddin hurriedly gets the back foot across to defend to the off side;
4.2;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run short and a touch too wide outside off, at 131 kph. Haddin stays back and steers into the covers. Not much carry or movement in this over.;
4.1;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run shortish ball outside off, Haddin rides the bounce properly and defends towards point;
3.6;1;Baidwan to Haddin, 1 run slow legcutter drifts onto the pads and Haddin glances to short third man for a single;
3.5;?;Baidwan to Haddin, no run better line, just outside the off and defended into the off side;
3.4;4;Baidwan to Haddin, FOUR runs Australia are living on edge here. Literally. Baidwan offers a mile of width outside off and Haddin slashes hard over the slip and through to third man;
3.3;?;Baidwan to Haddin, no run back of a length on off stump. Haddin covers the line and defends down the track;
3.2;?;Baidwan to Haddin, no run another shortish ball, another ungainly pull from Haddin to a ball that's not there for the shot even as he charges out.;
3.1;4;Baidwan to Haddin, FOUR runs I have seen Bollywood actors run faster than that, in slow motion shots. Cheema moves like a snail that's sleeping and gives Haddin another four. Haddin looks to force the pull away and doesn't time it at all. It looks like a single past mid on. Cheema keeps chasing and then dives, and can't pull it back.;
2.6;?;Osinde to Watson, no run that away seam again. Lands on a length and goes away from Watson who wisely lets it go this time. Can Canada keep up the intensity?;
2.5;1;Osinde to Haddin, 1 run short again, targeting the body and Haddin is rushed into the pull shot. He bottom-edges it without timing to midwicket for a single;
2.4;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run he charges out again, Osinder keeps it short and follows him, and Haddin plays a clumsy nothing shot that goes nowhere.;
2.3;4;Osinde to Haddin, FOUR runs ah, Haddin gets a four, with some help from Nitish at point who moves slowly and dives over the ball. Haddin charges, makes room as he backs away and times the square drive really well;
2.2;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run again, a bit of a legcutter, played off the outside half towards the off side;
2.1;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run lovely delivery, fuller than his normal fare in the previous over and nips away off the seam. Haddin just about covers the line as he presses forward to defend;
1.6;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run hmm, edgy start this. Another inside edge to an inducker, squirts away to the leg side.;
1.5;2;Baidwan to Watson, 2 runs oh Cheema! He's dropped a swirler. Short of a length delivery, not quite there for the pull but Watson went through with the shot. The fact that he could not get entirely under it meant the top edge took off behind mid on. Cheema moved back and seemed to have enough time, but he did not judge it well as he back-pedalled.;
1.4;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run angles in from slightly wide and holds its line, as Watson defends from the crease;
1.3;1;Baidwan to Haddin, 1 run too short and wide outside off, Haddin is away with a guided steer to third man;
1.2;1;Baidwan to Watson, 1 run ooh, this one nips in off the seam as Watson plays a half-hearted forward defensive. Inside edge squeezed away to the leg side.;
1.1;?;Baidwan to Watson, no run length ball on off stump to start off, easier for Watson who gets across to cover the line and defend;
0.6;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run that's one memorable over from Osinde who has got another ball to do a Garner on Haddin, landing back of a length and taking off. Haddin does well to weave away from the line.;
0.5;?;Osinde to Haddin, no run and now he has Haddin fishing with a classic away swinger. Don't think any Ugandan has better seam position than that. Curls into a line outside off and then goes away even as Haddin is sucked into the drive. So close to the outside edge;
0.4;1;Osinde to Watson, 1 run he lands one closer to Watson, who leans into a check drive to wide mid off;
0.3;?;Osinde to Watson, no run this one also goes through nicely outside off, Watson stays on the crease and shoulders arms;
0.2;?;Osinde to Watson, no run Osinde is getting lift steep as the face of the Niagra falls. Watson lets another one go outside off. Bangalore evening, ball nipping around under lights? I must be imagining this.;
0.1;?;Osinde to Watson, no run jaffa from Osinde! Lands one short of a length and gets it to jump away like a fiend, and Watson pulls the bat back inside the line.;

Watto and Haddin are out there. Looks like Watson will face. Two slips in place. Osinde warms up for a bowl.
Jonesy: "Jaques, I reckon Balaji Rao would've given up his scrambled eggs for a over 200 score."
Himanshu: "@Jacques: If you would have offered 211 to Australia at breakfast for chasing. They would have charged you :)"
Nirku: "Boy, looks like Nitin Sundar copped a hiding on the chatterbox this afternoon and has run away to do the over by over commentary on the game. Can we keep up the name calling and teasing on this forum?"
What hiding?? I had immense fun!
