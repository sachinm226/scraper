5pm: So, South Africa will need 372 to win the match and take the series. However you slice it, that's a tall order. Hundreds for David Warner and Steven Smith provided the sturdiest of bedrock and then the blitz from Head and Wade - who gorged on the death bowling to the tune of 46 from 22 balls - iced a very plump-looking cake. In the process, Dale Steyn conceded the worst figures by a SA bowler in ODIs. SA know how to chase down big totals but that is a daunting score; who's going to be the one in the dressing room to say, "They're 15 short"? Join us for the chase in 30 mins...
49.6;W;Rabada to Head, OUT full toss to finish and Head top-edges a slog pretty much straight up, Rabada running across to his right to take the catch - although he almost collides with du Plessis running in from cover! They check the delivery for height but it's just the right side of a no-ball, so the innings finishes with a wicket, Head and Wade's rambunctious partnership finally curtailed;Travis Head c & b Rabada 35 (27m 18b 4x4 1x6) SR: 194.44;

46.2;W;Steyn to Smith, OUT bowled him, Smith misses a slower ball! He tucks his bat under his arm and walks off, a fantastic knock but he won't go any further...

40.5;W;Phehlukwayo to Bailey, OUT got him, brilliant catch in the covers!

First change, Dwaine Petorius asked to ride the bronco...
 Innings Start
South Africa win by four wickets in an incredible run chase and with it take the series. It's the second-highest chase in ODIs (after you-know-when). Miller has played the innings of his life, but remember the role played by Phehlukwayo. "It was really nerve-wracking because I started off slowly. But I backed myself," he says on TV. "Just watch the ball. With David he really calmed me down. He said watch the ball, stand still and hit straight."
You did think that when de Kock and Rossouw went in quick succession that the task would be too much for South Africa. Remember, too, that Miller picked up an injury early in his innings but he kept his cool so well. He knew he could find the boundary when needed. Has to be said, however, that Australia's fielding fell apart towards the end
Lloyd: "What manner of hitting the ball was that, did it really happen?"
Venky : "If the 434 chased as few years ago was magnificent this is even more better with the injured miller and an young lucky chasing the score Nevertheless the series is conquered :)" That's a good debate to have
Jacques: "Does give me new respect for Miller, but it makes me wonder why he doesn't come in earlier. He obviously needs some time to settle before he gets going, and he is a genuine batsman not just six or nix type, so why not regularly bring him in earlier so he can take the time he needs?" Good to have a finisher, as he showed today
Ammar: "Fielding? Fell apart? That's not enough. Imploded. Unravelled. Amnesia. Paralysed. Erratic. Shambles. Now that feels a little on point."
Tom de Sailor: "Hey Andrew, of the Top 10 highest run chases, 8 of them are against Australia. Thoughts???" Stick them in to bat?
Time for some presentations...Steven Smith: "It's a disappointing. We had two blokes get hundreds and 370 is a pretty good score. You don't lose too many with that on the board but credit to South Africa. David Miller played a blinder. We probably didn't execute well enough with the ball. They will learn a lot out of this series. Still plenty to play for, we have to find a way to win."
Faf du Plessis: "I'd rank that up there with the best win I've been involved in. Most teams would think they are dead and buried. So proud of David Miller, over the moon for him. We'd have batted first as well. Thought 320 was a par score. With the batting we made sure we were ahead of the run rate. The greatest thing was that it was a chance for our middle order to win a game today and they did that. Took a freakish innings to get us across the line. An amazing knock. It looked impossible. It takes innings of bravey, Dave did that and Andile smoking a few over extra cover."
Man of the Match is David Miller: "It's a special moment, it was really nice to see the team home. Credit to the other batters as well. A great team performance. It was nice to do well in Australia, I'm enjoying my cricket, nice to come in with confidence. It was a great wicket. I thought if we batted 50 overs we'd get pretty close. Andile was really nervous, I remember those days, they he got his confidence. Just told him to remember the basics."
Right, what an evening. That just about wraps things up from here. Hope you enjoyed over coverage. For now, from Gnasher and Alan, it's goodbye and thanks for joining us.

48.6;4;Hastings to Phehlukwayo, FOUR runs he's done it again! What an innings from the new man. Short from round the wicket and Phehlukwayo effortlessly swivels on a pull turned hooked which nearly carries all the way to fine leg;
48.5;1;Hastings to Miller, 1 run over the wicket, low full toss at leg stump, for a second it looked liked he middled this into the gap but it's do the man at deep midwicket;
48.4;1lb;Hastings to Phehlukwayo, 1 leg bye goes for the pull, off the body again towards the keeper...South Africa won't care how they come;

47.4;?;Zampa to Phehlukwayo, no run now he goes right across outside off and goes for the sweep, gets taken on the pad;
47.3;6;Zampa to Phehlukwayo, SIX runs maybe Miller just said smash it! That's what he's done. Zampa dragged that down horribly and Lucky as pulled it over deep midwicket.;
47.2;?;Zampa to Phehlukwayo, no run another dot! Phehlukwayo thinks he can bring out the reverse-paddle-sweep...he misses, and almost falls over. Miller needs to have a word;
47.1;?;Zampa to Phehlukwayo, no run swing and a miss outside off, an appeal for a stumping and it goes upstairs...was the googly. Did he keep his foot grounded? Yes, he's well back;
46.6;6;Worrall to Miller, SIX runs that's huge!!! Onto the roof at deep square leg. A magnificent pick-up shot off his legs with a effortless swing of the arms. But he was offered length which is very hittable. Still, a humongous blow. Bounced out of the ground by the looks of it;
46.5;1;Worrall to Phehlukwayo, 1 run crunched out to deep cover;
46.4;4;Worrall to Phehlukwayo, FOUR runs what a shot! Anything Miller can do...Lucky goes up and over the off side, a wonderful inside-out lofted cover drive as he's given a hint of width;

45.4;4;Hastings to Miller, FOUR runs the fielding has been a shambles in the last 20 minutes and this is another howler! Through the legs of short fine leg from nothing more than a think inside edge by Miller. That's a shocker;
45.3;1;Hastings to Phehlukwayo, 1 run he's trying to cut loose as well now, but doesn't find the middle on this occasion, clubs this straight down the ground off somewhere near the toe end;

44.5;4;Tremain to Phehlukwayo, FOUR runs what a moment for him to find the rope, that's a lovely lofted cover drive to an over-pitched wide delivery, may have been a slower ball, yes it was, and he placed it perfectly;
44.4;?;Tremain to Phehlukwayo, no run low, straight full toss which he can only drive to cover;
44.3;1;Tremain to Miller, 1 run an important stretch by Hastings at short third man, Miller opened the face and he almost got it through...The Duke stuck out his left hand;

43.4;1;Hastings to Miller, 1 run short ball, pulled powerfully out to deep square leg who manages to get his body behind it;
43.3;4;Hastings to Miller, FOUR runs terrific shot, Miller playing a blinder! It was a wide yorker, but Miller manages to squeeze it over backward point and split the deep fielders. A late turn of the face. Such skill;

38.6;?;Tremain to Phehlukwayo, no run defended with bat and pad together to backward point;
38.5;?;Tremain to Phehlukwayo, no run big appeal for caught behind! Not given...Australia don't have a review left. Nicely bowled, in the channel outside off, was very close to the edge. Wade went up straightaway. There was a sound. Yep, Snicko shows an edge!;

36.1;1;Worrall to Miller, 1 run tucked into the leg side and that takes him to a 45-ball fifty;

35.5;2;Marsh to Pretorius, 2 runs gets inside the line and tucks this off his hip through square and they do well to convert that into a couple considering Miller is limping (more so after that);

34.3;?;Worrall to Pretorius, no run back of a length on off stump, punched to cover;

33.1;?;Hastings to Miller, no run Miller leaves his crease and aims a slog down the ground, big appeal for a catch behind, mainly from Wade... and Australia review. Hard to see any deviation but Wade seemed pretty convinced. Is there anything on Snicko? No, not really, don't think we have Hot Spot available so it's as you were;

31.2;?;Hastings to Miller, no run on the stumps, Miller drops down into the on side;
31.1;W;Hastings to Duminy, OUT slapped high into the leg side - but he's picked out the man on the rope! Oh dear, not sure what Duminy was thinking there, a short break in play and that's the partnership scuppered. Swung across the line and Finch barely had to move, a step to the left and clutched to his chest;Jean-Paul Duminy c Finch b Hastings 20 (44m 26b 0x4 0x6) SR: 76.92;
