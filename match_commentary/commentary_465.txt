4.55 pm South Africa have lost six wickets for 25 runs, collapsing from 241 for 4 to 266. A lot of the dismissals were to bad shots.
Simon: "Tahir looks like a good old fashioned tail ender. Not in the Phantoms class but certainly pretty inept with the bat. Could be a way back for Harris if Tahir doesn't start taking wickets..."
Cam: "Will SA take a risk and open with the spinners? Try and put pressure on Hughes and Watson." I can't see why they would want to. They'd want to unleash Steyn and Philander/Morkel at the openers right away. And if the umpires offer the light, then so be it. Come back tomorrow and start afresh. No point in not attacking with your best bowlers at the start.

31.3;4;Cummins to de Villiers, FOUR runs shot! The length is a bit short and the ball sits up for AB, who swivels and pulls majestically through midwicket. That ball didn't come off the pitch as quickly as the others have. Or maybe AB was just that quick, because he seemed to have a lot of time;
31.2;1;Cummins to Prince, 1 run Prince gets going by moving back and playing the ball off his hips behind square;
31.1;W;Cummins to Amla, OUT there's his first Test wicket! Cummins bowls a fullish ball outside off stump, Amla tries to play a powerful drive through cover.

28.4;4;Siddle to Kallis, FOUR runs Kallis goes past 12,000 by edging a short of a length ball between second slip and gully. Kallis stayed on the back foot and pushed away from his body at a short of a length ball. He gets a standing ovation from his team-mates and the ground;

 Innings Start
5.10 pm Australia were 174 for 0 shortly after lunch, after Watson and Hughes had caned the South African bowlers at more than five an over in the morning session. South Africa were a changed team after lunch and took ten wickets for 122 runs, limiting Australia's lead to only 30. So this is effectively a one-innings shoot-out now.
Johnson's unbeaten 38 is invaluable to Australia. Paul: "What is this? Battle of the chokers?"
South Africa's second innings begins in ten minutes.

91.4;?;Lyon to Steyn, no run shout for lbw, as Steyn pushes outside the line as he comes forward to a flighted one and is hit on the pad, Clarke is going for the review, just less that half of the ball would have hit the leg stump, but the original call was not-out, it is the on-field umpire's call and stays not out, a shame really, that looked out, can't the umpire's call ever change on getting additional evidence?;

87.2;W;Lyon to Boucher, OUT he's struck with the second delivery, or has he, slip takes the ball, but was an edge involved? it was the full length that had him driving, lots of flight on that one, and there is a healthy edge on that one as Boucher almost runs it straight to Watto at slip, wonder what all the confusion was about, Billy does the crooked finger after checking with the third umpire;Mark Boucher c Watson b Lyon 13 (41m 20b 3x4 0x6) SR: 65;

78.6;W;Siddle to Amla, OUT eep, needless run out sends Prince back, Amla plonked this shortish one towards point and trotted down the track, there was no run there, Prince initially started to run, then applied the brakes, Amla was already accelerating and wasn't about to stop, and Prince had no chance of making it across to the other end as Ponting ran in from point to take the bails off, did well not to withdraw towards his end, else the centurion would have been dismissed;Ashwell Prince run out (Ponting) 2 (26m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.11;

75.2;?;Cummins to Amla, no run pitched up further, on the stumps, this is testing stuff, Amla drives, but not with a great deal of authority, to mid on;

73.4;1;Cummins to Prince, 1 run flicked in the air, but safely behind the man at a shortish square leg position, Ausralia thought that was close, wasn't enough;

73.2;?;Cummins to Prince, no run swing in to the left-hander, a half-shout too as it hits the pads, looked to be going down leg;
73.1;W;Cummins to de Villiers, OUT Cummins has struck now, mighty poor half-stroke from AB though, he is caught at second slip, Cummins had been trying to do this all morning, getting the batsman to drive, but the length had not been as full, it was this time, sucked AB out, who tried to push without moving the feet much, and ended up having a sort of poke at it, it still fairly flew off the edge high to Clarke at second slip;AB de Villiers c Clarke b Cummins 73 (197m 136b 10x4 1x6) SR: 53.67;

72.3;?;Johnson to Amla, no run bouncer at 130 kph, does too much off the pitch and the only thing it manages is giving Haddin a workout behind the stumps as he takes it very high;

72.1;1;Johnson to de Villiers, 1 run worked square on the leg side for a single;
71.6;1;Cummins to de Villiers, 1 run another one that keeps a shade low, there have been a couple of them now already this morning, nothing alarming as it is miles outside off, but Ab would have expected it to bounce much more from back of a length, he does well to push it in front of point;
71.5;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run takes a massive stride forward and shoulders arms to one that holds its line some way outside off;
71.4;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run goes short now, but the angle takes it safely down leg even as AB ducks;

 Innings Start
Right, that winds up our coverage of the most outrageous Test series we have seen in a while. Firdose Moonda and Brydon Coverdale must be dazed at the end of it all, but I trust they will soon be in a position to send us insights, comments and plenty of analysis. On behalf of the gang, this is Nitin Sundar checking out. I really am out of words now, and my fingers are hurting. As Vincent Vega would have said it, "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack."
Clarke: "What an amazing series for all the supporters of Test cricket. Some ups and downs through out the series, but it has been really exciting. I was yelling and carrying on like an absolute goose, but we were cheering every run. It is about now managing Cummins and making sure he becomes one of the all-time greats. We are working our backsides off and trying our best, but what a performance today .. I am proud of the boys. Tremendous courage and great batting from Ponting, it is great to have him around."
"I have to give a 10 minute speech on Australia's Constitution in 12 hours, but I have barely started because of this match. I stand by my choice." Wow, Caillan.
Smith: "The last few series we have played with Australia have been good adverts for Test cricket, and it was no different this time. They played really well today. It is wonderful to see Test cricket played like this, but right now there is disappointment with the result."
Vernon Philander is Man of the Series. "There were huge expectations from me, and I enjoyed it. The conditions here had a little more overhead than Cape Town, but not very different otherwise."
Pat Cummins is Man of the Match, no surprises there. And Mike Haysman asks him about the 13 runs, not the six wickets! "Mitch asked me to keep a cool head, and I took that for swinging," he says with that unbelievable grin. "Great to bowl them out yesterday, and to contribute was even better. I was looking up to Sidds and Johnson through out for support and they bowled beautifully."
You thought Cape Town was extraordinary? Johannesburg suppressed a quiet snigger and gave us this. How does one even begin to explain what we have seen today! Australia were down for the count, with Ponting, a shade of what he used to be, trying hard to piece together an innings. He got partial redemption, but couldn't finish things. Haddin got redemption, but still SA seemed set to take the win. Mitch had his redemption too, but it was down to that giggly babyface of a champion in the making to seal the win. What. A. Game.
"Productivity at work hit an all time low because of this thrilling test!! Long live test cricket!," says Rene.
Sidvee tweets the way only he can: "What a finish! Test cricket is thriving. The series is over! Test cricket is dead." A two-Test series. What a cruel joke!
"Oh my god! Is this the most remarkable test match in history? Khawaja's first 50, Ponting, Haddin under IMMENSE pressure, then Johnson, Philander getting second 5 for in a row, and the 18 year old sensation with the winning runs after a 6 for! THAT'S why these two are the best cricketing nations," says Timmy.
"Absorbing contest...in the end, how crucial was Australia's first innings lead of 30" - that came from Grant.
"Just saw the tour schedule which reads Aus.. SA.. Aus.. SA.. Aus.. SA.. Aus.. Incredible." - that's just a given when these teams play, eh Jagadesh.
Meanwhile, India slip back to second in the Test championships table, while SA have gone down to third.
86.5;4;Tahir to Cummins, FOUR runs There's Cummins and there's goings! Australia have levelled the series. Tahir loses control and delivers a marginally short ball, and Cummins carts it away through midwicket for four. That huge smile is in place, Cummins pumps his fists and runs into Mitch and gives him a bear hug. Langer and the rest of the Aussie balcony go up in unison. Australia are back ...... and the series is over.;
86.4;?;Tahir to Cummins, no run I have seen everything now! Cummins leaves a ball barely half a foot outside off. No. 10 on debut leaves a ball alone. In this situation. Test cricket, you little beauty!;
86.3;?;Tahir to Cummins, no run Huge appeal for lbw, given not out and it is referred. Googly from Tahir, it lands well outside off but turns in sharply. Cummins did well to thrust the front pad outside the line, though he missed it. Two reds light up, but he was hit a couple of inches outside the line! Lyon has a minor heart attack in the dressing room! Spare a thought for him!;
86.2;1;Tahir to Johnson, 1 run too short, Mitch quietly goes back in the crease and pushes a single into the covers. Four to win!;
86.1;?;Tahir to Johnson, no run googly on off stump and breaking away, Mitch quietly plays it to the off side.;
85.6;?;Steyn to Cummins, no run beaten outside off now Is there anything else that can happen in this over? Typical Steyn ball, shapes in, lands on off stump and lurches away. Cummins drives down the ground, but the ball keeps going away and misses the edge.;
85.5;?;Steyn to Cummins, no run boy, he's the Dr. Jekyll and the Mr. Hyde of batting! Short ball outside off, he goes for a mindless pull and misses this time.;
85.4;?;Steyn to Cummins, no run another short ball. Cummins is too tall to be bounced out, he again stands tall and forces it down to the leg side.;
85.3;?;Steyn to Cummins, no run beaten outside off! Cummins attempts a big booming cover drive now, but the ball lands wide and keeps swinging away past his shot. Five to win, they are a shot away now.;
85.2;4;Steyn to Cummins, FOUR runs dropped! Dropped by Steyn! The world's best fast bowler drops the most promising young fast bowler. What a moment! Full ball on off stump, Cummins was early on the drive and went hard at it, it flew past Steyn to his left. He couldn't get the hands around in time. Tahir ran back all the way and put in the slide, but he couldn't save the boundary cleanly.;
85.1;?;Steyn to Cummins, no run wide of off stump, it swings away from there but Cummins seems to have some idea of which ones to play at. He leaves this one.;
84.6;1;Philander to Cummins, 1 run full ball on the pads, Cummins keeps his cool once again and works a single off the pads. The target is down to single figures.;
84.5;1;Philander to Johnson, 1 run Australia have 300! Mitch gets width outside off and drives square for a controlled single to the deep.;
84.4;2;Philander to Johnson, 2 runs Mitch gets two more, Vernon is looking for the outside edge as he angles one across, and Mitch laces it into the covers for a couple. Morn is not nearly quick enough to cut the second run.;
84.3;1;Philander to Cummins, 1 run on the pads now, Cummins keeps his cool to works it around wide of mid-on for another single.;
84.3;1w;Philander to Cummins, 1 wide Vernon thuds the bouncer in too short, Boucher takes off into the sky to collect it and save some extras. It is called a wide.;
84.2;?;Philander to Cummins, no run a pearl of an outswinger, completely wasted on Cummins. Landed on a length outside off and went away as if inspired by drugs! Cummins was at least a foot away from edging it, though he played a proper air stroke.;
84.1;?;Philander to Cummins, no run short ball from Vernon, he's looking to bounce Cummins out now, but Cummins stays on the back foot and plays to the leg side.;
83.6;3;Steyn to Cummins, 3 runs leading edge, and it nearly goes all the way to the cover boundary! Cummins was looking to drive, but the ball seemed to deviate away from the straight and took the edge to bound away towards deep cover. Despite Mitch's problems, they get three, which means Cummins will face ...;
83.5;?;Steyn to Cummins, no run fast and short, aimed at the ribs, and Cummins does really well to climb atop the bounce and play it down to the leg side.;
83.4;W;Steyn to Siddle, OUT Steyn has a wicket. All is well with the world. Siddle is gone to a super soft dismissal. Full, fast, straight, Siddle probably knew what was coming, he was back in the crease and got his bat down in time to save the pads, but ended up scooping it to Tahir at silly mid-on. Tahir takes the dolly with aplomb, Steyn goes berserk, and Siddle just jogs away...;Peter Siddle c Imran Tahir b Steyn 4 (7m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;
83.3;?;Steyn to Siddle, no run short and wide of off stump, Siddle can't hold back! He has an ugly heave away from the body, but can't reach.;
83.2;4;Steyn to Siddle, FOUR runs Siddle's driven him to the fence! The field is in, Steyn wants the wicket and bowls a full ball on the pads, Siddle holds his nerve and rolls the wrists to send it packing through midwicket. 18 to win.;
83.1;1;Steyn to Johnson, 1 run angled in at blistering pace, Mitch hops and fends in order to protect his elbow and gets a single into the midwicket area.;
82.6;?;Philander to Siddle, no run covers the line and gets a thick outside edge on it this time, to squeeze it towards point. What an astounding over from Philander!;
82.5;?;Philander to Siddle, no run Philander is doing Shane Warne at 135 kph, with a hard new ball. Another one curls away menacingly, and Siddle has an optimistic swish at it. No luck for either team on that one.;
82.4;?;Philander to Siddle, no run beaten outside off! Siddle leans out and looks to drive ambitiously away from the body, and the outswinger just keeps going away.;
82.3;?;Philander to Siddle, no run short ball going away from outside off, and Siddle shoulders arms.;
82.2;W;Philander to Haddin, OUT Haddin's gone! The new ball has swung away at long last, and Philander has five again! He plans to do this every Test of his career. It angled in, landed back of a length and whistled away past an extravagant drive, taking the faintest of tickles on its way to Boucher. I didn't see the edge, but Haddin didn't review it. It was dying on him, but had enough legs to get into the gloves. What an absolute ripper of a Test match!;Brad Haddin c ?Boucher b Philander 55 (142m 106b 7x4 0x6) SR: 51.88;
82.1;?;Philander to Haddin, no run Philo plugs away short of a driving length, Haddin gets back and across and blocks obdurately.;
81.6;4;Steyn to Johnson, FOUR runs boy, every time they play and a miss, they follow it up with a gem of a stroke! Steyn goes fuller this time, Steyn thumps him straight back between the pitch and mid-on, all along the carpet, comprehensive as they come. He holds the pose for an extra instant too.;
81.5;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run that's gone straight through him! Steyn gets the new cherry to swing in drastically, even as Mitch plants the front foot across and drives through what he thinks is the line. The ball just whistles through the gap.;
81.4;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run this one homes in from back of a length, but meets the middle of Mitch's bat as he stays back and covers the line.;
81.3;1;Steyn to Haddin, 1 run looks to get them on the drive, full ball outside off, but Haddin controls the shot well and middles it into the covers. Mitch is definitely struggling, there was two to be had there, but they settle for one.;
81.2;1;Steyn to Johnson, 1 run attacks the stumps, gets the ball to straighten from off stump and Mitch works it with the deviation to midwicket for a single.;
81.1;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run full ball outside off, straightening down the line, and Mitch lets it go. Too wide.;
80.6;4;Philander to Haddin, FOUR runs Brad is taking this home! Another smashing corker of a cover drive, he leans out, gets half way to the pitch and just throws the hands at it, through the line. He then blows the smoke off the barrels and slides it back into the holster. What a smash of an on-the-up drill that was!;
80.5;?;Philander to Haddin, no run attacks the stumps with more intent this time, Haddin is behind the line and defends to the off side.;
80.4;?;Philander to Haddin, no run shortens the length, Vernon's pace has not been quite threatening in the last two spells. Haddin lets this go to the keeper.;
80.3;?;Philander to Haddin, no run Haddin opens the face, looking for four through third man, but Prince at gully does well to deny him.;
80.2;1;Philander to Johnson, 1 run the moment Philo comes on, things start happening. He straightens this from the leg stump line as Mitch goes for an airy drive, but he gets an inside edge onto the pad and into the off side for a single.;
80.1;?;Philander to Johnson, no run full length ball at a gentle pace on the pads, Mitch defends cautiously to the leg side.;
79.6;2;Tahir to Haddin, 2 runs on the pads, Haddin works him around to midwicket and milks a couple more. Haddin has a 50! Given the context of the game, I wonder if a wicketkeeper has ever played a more personally important innings, ever.;
79.5;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run gets the pad out to defend with the spin into the off side.;
79.4;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run;
79.3;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run;
79.2;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run gets the pad across to a full ball and keeps it out comfortably.;
79.1;1;Tahir to Johnson, 1 run short googly, doesn't cut it at all. Mitch rolls it around through midwicket for a single. What's worse, that's Tahir's second warning. I don't think he'll bowl another over today, though.;
78.6;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run Morne gets this one to come in off the seam, Haddin blocks it to mid-off and thinks of a risky single, but they decide against it in time.;
78.5;1;Morkel to Johnson, 1 run and now he angles down the leg side, this is getting easier now. Mitch works it with the angle to square leg for a single.;
78.5;1nb;Morkel to Johnson, (no ball) and he over-steps. Length ball on off stump, Mitch defends confidently.;
78.4;1;Morkel to Haddin, 1 run well played, Morne drifts onto the pads, and Haddin whips it from the crease through midwicket for a single.;
78.3;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run back of a length outside off, Haddin stays in the crease and shoulders arms.;
78.2;2lb;Morkel to Haddin, 2 leg byes A waste of a review! Unless Smith wants time to gather his thoughts, or just waste some time. Morne slants this down the leg side, Haddin skips across as he tries to glance, and it goes off the pad behind square. Ridiculous appeal, it hit him in front of the sixth stump and would have hit the seventh. Ruled not out, two minutes lopped off just like that ... And momentum stalled.;
78.1;4;Morkel to Haddin, FOUR runs the tide has turned and how! Haddin gets thje half step out and smokes Morne on the up over the covers, and holds the pose too. What a turnaround. Haddin and Mitch have added 50. They are both playing for their careers here!;
77.6;?;Tahir to Johnson, no run straighter one to end the over, Mitch is squared up as he feels for it, but no edge;
77.5;4;Tahir to Johnson, FOUR runs and another! What did Australia have for tea? Mitch drills a full ball against the spin through the covers for four more. Tahir is bowling some good balls, but leaking too many runs in the mean time.;
77.4;4;Tahir to Johnson, FOUR runs Saffers, what's happening! Smith misfields at point and Mitch has four more. Short googly, Mitch has ample time to stay back and stroke it square, and Smith dives over it.;
77.3;?;Tahir to Johnson, no run googly landed outside leg and breaking in, Mitch covers it well. He's reading him now, unlike the first innings.;
77.2;?;Tahir to Johnson, no run tossed up, Mitch leans out and drives against the spin into the covers.;
77.1;?;Tahir to Johnson, no run quick ball outside off, Mitch stays on the crease and spots it to defend down the track.;
76.6;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run short of a length to end the over, Haddin defends from the crease.;
76.5;2;Morkel to Haddin, 2 runs angled in from wide of the crease, Haddin looks to flick and seems to have feathered it onto the pad for a legbye towards midwicket. And then a needless overthrow. SA are running ragged here.;
76.4;1;Morkel to Johnson, 1 run fuller, Mitch stays calm to push it to mid-off for a single. He now has some pleasantries to exchange with Morne! This game is turning in the last session.;
76.3;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run pushes him back, Mitch stays on the crease and opens the face to guide it almost into gully's hand. But it lands short.;
76.2;4;Morkel to Johnson, FOUR runs Morne doesn't say anything this time! Mitch plays the same shot, but this time the ball is in the slot and the leather comes off as the ball shoots through mid-off. Somewhere in Mumbai, Ravi Shastri is muttering 'Tracer Bullet' under his breath.;
76.1;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run and an indiscreet shot out of nowhere! Short of a length ball, angling in and rising prodigiously, Mitch was in no position to play a shot, but looked to drive on the up, and lost the grip on the bat as it whistled through. Morne lets Mitch know what he thinks!;
75.6;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run the topspinner to end the over, Haddin gets forward and plays around the front pad but does well to keep it out.;
75.5;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run very full on off stump, Haddin plays it watchfully to the covers.;
75.4;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run slower, looped up on off stump, Haddin presses forward to defend.;
75.3;2;Tahir to Haddin, 2 runs quick legbreak this time, it fizzes away and Haddin waits to guide it late past third man. SA are sweating, again!;
75.2;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run googly, dropped too short. Looked like Haddin spotted it as he shaped to pull, but he ended up bottom-edging it onto his boot.;
75.1;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run tossed up and turning away, Haddin jumps out and defends with bat and pad close together to the off side.;
74.6;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run ends the over with a bristling bouncer outside off, and Mitch shows a lot of composure to stays out of the line and drop the wrists.;
74.5;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run Morne alters the length, goes very full and straight, Mitch digs it out adequately.;
74.4;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run short ball, and Mitch has a go outside off! He tries to pull it from well outside off, but it is through him quite quickly.;
74.3;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run stays sedate on the back foot and defends a straight ball to the leg side now.;
74.2;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run Morne bends this in from a length, Mitch covers the line somewhat shakily but keeps the ball out.;
74.1;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run full length ball outside off, Mitch covers the line and defends down the track.;
73.6;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run Haddin presses forward again, is at least two metres out when he pads up to a ball on leg stump.;
73.5;1;Tahir to Johnson, 1 run wrong 'un, Mitch spots it and cuts to the deep for a single. He ran without much trouble this time.;
73.4;1;Tahir to Haddin, 1 run Tahir's not looking the part here. Another one on the pads, nudged behind square for easy runs. Far too easy runs to be leaked at this stage.;
73.3;1;Tahir to Johnson, 1 run another full ball, Johnson eases it off the front foot to deep point and they should have two ... But they don't, Johnson has pulled up, he's down at the non-striker's end and has pulled his boot out. Very strange, he's somehow got a pebble, or may be a spike through the sole of his foot. He trotted through very gingerly for that single. Ok, he's fine now. What ever that was, it is out of the boot now.;
73.2;1;Tahir to Haddin, 1 run another full ball, Haddin this time skips out to get to the flight and pushes it down to mid-on for a single.;
73.1;1;Tahir to Johnson, 1 run over-pitched on the toes, he's done this too often. Mitch works it away square for a single.;
72.6;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run end of a poor Steyn over, Haddin stays on the back foot and keeps out a length ball.;
72.5;4;Steyn to Haddin, FOUR runs haven't seen a better shot all day. Haddin gets one over-pitched into his slot and screw-drives it down the ground with a comprehensive push down the ground. The ball veritably disappeared from his presence.;
72.4;1;Steyn to Johnson, 1 run another gentle paced delivery outside off, Mitch punches to mid-off for one more.;
72.3;4;Steyn to Johnson, FOUR runs thumped with a flourish! Good start for Aus after tea. Length ball outside off, not too fast and Mitch just smashes it cleanly past Amla at cover for four. Amla would have cut that off on another day.;
72.2;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run better line, just outside of and Mitch shows good judgement to let it go to the keeper.;
72.2;1w;Steyn to Johnson, 1 wide and he's delivered a wide, miles down the off side. Mitch is out of the way easily.;

71.3;?;Philander to Haddin, no run back of a length outside off stump this time, Haddin lets it go.;

70.6;?;Tahir to Johnson, no run a peach of a googly to end the session. Mitch didn't spot it, he wasn't even close! Beaten all ends up as it rips past. That's tea for the last time in the blink-and-you-miss-it Test series.;
70.5;?;Tahir to Johnson, no run very full outside off, Mitch defends off the outer half of the blade towards point. Haddin wants a single, and then changes his mind.;

69.1;W;Philander to Hussey, OUT gone! Is Hussey referring it? He is.. Incisive length ball, holds its line, catches him on the hop as he looks to play to the leg side. He was on the back foot and that was hitting the middle of middle. The only thing that can save him is if it pitched outside leg. It didn't. Most of the ball is in the mat. Gone! South Africa need four wickets for the whitewash. What an epic ripper of a debut series Vernon is having!;Michael Hussey lbw b Philander 39 (124m 77b 3x4 0x6) SR: 50.64;
68.6;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run another gift from Tahir, full toss driven straight to cover.;
68.5;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run the flipper. Haddin hangs back in the crease and is set up nicely for the lbw, but gets the bat down in time to defend it. Well played in the end.;

67.2;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run Morne ducks this one into the pads from outside off, and Haddin defends on the hop.;
67.1;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run Haddin continues to disregard the situation and play strange shots. Tries to steer another ball outside off without getting into position, and misses. Utterly needless. Mind-blowing shot selection.;
66.6;?;Tahir to Hussey, no run lands this one outside off, Hussey gets the pad and bat across to blunt it before it breaks it.;

65.2;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run stays on the crease and pushes a length ball into the covers.;
65.1;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run Haddin continues to exhibit strange shot selection. Bouncer from Morne at fierce pace, Haddin attemps a hook since there's no one back, but that ball was really pacy. Through him before he knew it,.;

63.3;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run another pleasing off-drive from Haddin for no runs. He specialises in playing this beautifully, but straight to mid-off.;
63.2;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run and now he throws the kitchen plumbing at a wide one outside off, and misses it completely. Very wide, it was there for the punishment, but Haddin didn't connect.;
63.1;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run whoa, what a leave. Haddin sees one jar in off the seam, stays back and just shoulders arms. Was he leaving it on bounce, there wasn't much of that either ...;

62.5;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run flighted on the off stump line, driven with the turn straight to cover.;
62.4;1;Tahir to Hussey, 1 run Is that dropped? What a miss if it was!

62.1;1;Tahir to Hussey, 1 run full toss from Tahir, Hussey laces him wide of mid-off for a quick single.;
61.6;4;Steyn to Haddin, FOUR runs Australia have 200. Steyn goes full and fast on the pads, and Haddin uses the laws of physics to redirect it at the same pace it arrived, away through square leg for four. It was a slower ball, it was played uppishly but safe, and the timing was good.;
61.5;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run 140 kph on that short ball, Haddin weaves out of the way decisively.;
61.4;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run this one comes in with the angle, Haddin is on the hop as he looks to work it square. Half an appeal for lbw, but that was surely heading down the leg side.;
61.3;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run slower one at 120 kph, full offcutter, Haddin doesn't fall for it and defends with the full face.;
61.2;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run short ball, it was a-coming. Angled down the leg side, easy decision for Haddin to get under it, and it was short enough for him to get out of harm's way too.;
61.1;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run short of a length on off stump, Haddin stays on the back foot and defends into the off side.;
60.6;?;Tahir to Hussey, no run beaten by the googly! Hussey gropes away without reading him off the hand, Tahir is distraught and prances away dramatically. The umpire has another word with him about running on the pitch.;
60.5;?;Tahir to Hussey, no run tossed up and breaking in deceptively, Hussey wasn't to the flight as he leaned out and it went off the inside edge to the leg side.;
60.4;?;Tahir to Hussey, no run looped up on off stump, Hussey leans out and defends.;

60.2;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run leans across again, opens the face and defends with the spin to the off side.;
60.1;?;Tahir to Haddin, no run tossed up on off stump, Haddin is confidently forward to defend it. He was owned by Tahir in the first innings ...;
59.6;2;Steyn to Hussey, 2 runs over-pitched to end the over, Hussey drives powerfully into the covers and the fielder does really well to cut it off. Amla is the man.;
59.5;2;Steyn to Hussey, 2 runs Hussey races across, another short ball, he is quickly in position and pulls it away square and sprints back to keep Haddin away from the strike.;
59.4;1;Steyn to Haddin, 1 run another snorter, this one just keeps climbing, and Haddin leaps up to meet it mid-air like a kung-fu master. Well played, immensely well played, he taps it to the leg side and there is no square leg.;
59.3;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run three cheers to helmet makers! Haddin has taken a sickening blow on the side of the head, but is back up almost immediately. Short ball, Haddin wanted to duck under it, but suddenly realised it was not as short as he imagined. The head was in the firing line, Haddin didn't have time to get the hands in the way, and just looked away. The ball have him a nice little clunk and went away. Haddin looked dazed for a moment.;
59.2;1;Steyn to Hussey, 1 run on the pads, Hussey tucks it square and gets a single.;
59.1;?;Steyn to Hussey, no run real pace from Steyn, the bouncer at 145 kph, and Hussey scrambles down for safety;
58.6;?;Philander to Haddin, no run beaten outside off by the wobble. Vernon seems to have the skill to get almost every ball to do something. This one shapes in, lands on the seam and goes away sharply, leaving in its wake a completely befuddled Haddin who isn't even close to covering the line.;
58.5;?;Philander to Haddin, no run bouncer, banged in ridiculously low and wide of off stump too. Haddin lets it go after thinking of the pull.;
58.4;?;Philander to Haddin, no run 130 kph, dangled on a full length and coming in, Haddin is late to come forward but covers the line to play it back to the bowler.;
58.3;?;Philander to Haddin, no run Vernon holds the length back, Haddin stays on the crease and covers the line to defend.;
58.2;?;Philander to Haddin, no run nice, confident drive. Haddin can't get any runs for it, though. Straight to mid-off. Full ball outside off and played fluently off the front foot.;
58.1;?;Philander to Haddin, no run Vernon lands this on off and gets it to straighten, Haddin covers the line well and defends.;
57.6;1;Steyn to Haddin, 1 run gets the single this time, pushing with the deviation into the covers.;
57.5;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run stays on the crease again, Steyn goes straighter and gets the ball to hurtle through after landing on leg. Haddin's bat comes down at the very last moment to play it to mid-on.;
57.4;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run beaten outside off by a corker. Pommie Mbangwa describes the footwork thus - "Haddin has his feet in a bucket". Succinctly put. The feet don't go anywhere as he just follows the ball with his hands. He isn't Mark Waugh. He doesn't connect with it.;
57.3;1;Steyn to Hussey, 1 run on the pads, Hussey skips inside the line and tucks it square for a single.;
57.2;?;Steyn to Hussey, no run hmm, looks to square Hussey up this time from the middle and off line, but Hussey covers the line well to defend down the track.;
57.1;?;Steyn to Hussey, no run Steyn's worst ball of the day, he's as surprised as us after bumping a bouncer down miles outside off stump.;
56.6;1;Philander to Hussey, 1 run Vernon gets this one to go away from the middle and leg line, it was full enough for Hussey to get forward to, and works it to the leg side for a single.;
56.5;1;Philander to Haddin, 1 run better from Brad, hangs back, covers the line and defends an away seamer into the off side.;
56.4;4;Philander to Haddin, FOUR runs punches this one, a touch on the up, but it was full enough for the drive. Haddin gets half across and drives fluently through the line for a boundary through the covers.;
56.3;?;Philander to Haddin, no run poor, poor shot. The sort you are allowed to play only if you are Mark Waugh. Short and wide outside off, not the kind to be playing at this time in the game. Haddin has a needless swish and misses.;
56.2;?;Philander to Haddin, no run Vernon angles one in off the seam, Haddin is caught on the back foot and defends away from the body. The inside edge hits his boot and goes away.;
56.1;1;Philander to Hussey, 1 run short ball, Vernon's stock away seamer that, Hussey waits for it to come on and steers through point for a single.;
55.6;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run goes too wide of off stump this time, as the ball seams away. Haddin shoulders arms again.;
55.5;2;Steyn to Haddin, 2 runs Steyn's turned on menace mode here. Another full and fast ball that seams away, Haddin was on the backfoot but did well to cover the line and play it into the covers for a couple.;
55.4;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run Haddin gets an outswinger, he is late to get the front foot across but no problem since he was leaving it this time.;
55.3;1;Steyn to Hussey, 1 run full length ball on the pads, worked with the angle through midwicket.;
55.2;?;Steyn to Hussey, no run better from Hussey, chooses to leave this time as Steyn probes away at some pace.;
55.1;4;Steyn to Hussey, FOUR runs boy, that's some dramatic start to his spell. Hussey does everything except get out as Steyn gets a good length ball to angled across, land on off and straighten. Hussey was neither forward nor back as he looked to chop to the off side, but the ball darted in and took the inside edge. How did it miss the stumps? How did it go just wide of Boucher's reach?;
54.6;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run ends with a short of length ball that jumps up and thuds into the middle of the bat as Haddin hops.;
54.5;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run too wide outside off to trouble Haddin, he gives it the all clear as he stays on the crease.;
54.4;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run Haddin hops with the bounce and defends a short of length ball outside off to the off side.;
54.3;1;Morkel to Hussey, 1 run Hussey gets a single, opens the face as is his wont and deflects a length ball into the off side.;
54.2;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run jaffa, Morne the giraffe gets the ball to come in from a high trajectory and then go away off the seam. Hussey is completely clueless as he plays a yard inside the line.;
54.1;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run ouch, Morne takes a tumble as he delivers a full ball from round the stumps, Hussey tucks it to the leg side.;
53.6;1;Kallis to Hussey, 1 run gets another single now. Full from Kallis on the stumps and the off-drive is mistimed wide of mid-off. Drinks in Jo'burg after South Africa's morning.;
53.5;2;Kallis to Hussey, 2 runs Hussey walks into the drive this time, it was fuller and allowed him to get decisively forward. Squeezed cautiously into the covers, and Hussey races back for the second.;
53.4;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run another tempter, angled across from over the stumps, lands outside off and holds its line. Hussey remains unimpressed.;
53.3;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run goes fuller this time, Hussey gets the front foot across and shoulders arms as it carries nicely to Bouch.;
53.2;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run shaped across Hussey again, lands on a length and goes away. Hussey leaves.;
53.1;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run Kallis whistles another one across Hussey, who watches the ball closely for clues as it goes past.;
52.6;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run ends with the in-between length at 137 kph, Haddin hangs on the crease and covers the line to defend to the off side.;
52.5;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run pitched up, and Haddin is ready. He's half forward and drives nicely, but straight to mid-off.;
52.4;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run Haddin stays on the crease, this was short of a length and buzzing through at lively pace. Good judgement from Haddin, he lets it go to the keeper.;
52.3;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run shorter, 138.4 kph and nipping away, Haddin stays on the crease and raises the arms.;
52.2;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run gentle away seam to go with the pace and bounce. Haddin doesn't move the feet in any direction and just leaves.;
52.1;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run wide of off stump from Morkel and nice cary, Haddin stays on the crease and leaves.;
51.6;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run short of a length to end the over, Hussey stays on the crease and defends to the off side.;
51.5;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run good bouncer, 137 kph and gunning for the head, Hussey had no where to go, and dropped his wrists before swaying out of danger.;
51.4;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run Kallis tempts him again outside off, length ball well outside off and Hussey leaves.;
51.3;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run short and wide of off stump, Hussey stays beside the line and thinks of an upper cut, but lets it go.;
51.2;3;Kallis to Haddin, 3 runs Rudolph tags a thick edge mercilessly and saves a boundary. Back of a length outside off, Haddin is on the back foot, flirting with an angled face, and gets the edge to drop down and dribble away towards third man. Rudolph does well.;
51.1;1;Kallis to Hussey, 1 run full length to Hussey, he prances into position and drives into the off side for a single.;
50.6;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run finishes off with another big bouncing ball outside off, Haddin lets it go untouched now.;
50.5;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run hmm, not completely in control. Morne gets this one to kick up extra from short of a length, Haddin was on the back foot and not entirely on top of the bounce. But he dropped it away to the off side, short of the cordon.;
50.4;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run much fuller, Haddin leans forward to drive this to mid-off.;
50.3;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run covers the line this time, and defends with the deviation into the off side.;
50.2;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run Morkel keeps it wide outside off again, very similar to the ball Ponting fell for. Haddin doesn't go for it.;
50.1;W;Morkel to Ponting, OUT is that the last ball of Ponting's glittering career? It is the end of this innings, and what a strong effort it was. It has ended in rather meek fashion though. Short and pacy from Morkel, wide of off stump and asking to be left. Ponting's been very astute all morning, but this time he goes for a flat-footed cut. The pace and bounce on the ball is too much, it takes the edge and flies into the slips. The glint in the eye, the stony gaze, Ponting takes a look at the toe of his bat, which it where it hit, he sees it is over and marches off. No lingering, no theatrics. The handful of people in the ground rise to salute the legend.;Ricky Ponting c Rudolph b Morkel 62 (218m 138b 6x4 0x6) SR: 44.92;
49.6;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run ends with a full length ball outside off, and Hussey defends it back to the bowler.;
49.5;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run 132 kph, this one lands on middle and leg and then nips away, forcing Hussey to play at it. He still does well to cover the line and defend to the off side.;
49.4;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run goes a touch wider outside off this time, Hussey stays put on the crease and extends his arms out of harm's way.;
49.3;?;Kallis to Hussey, no run fuller length, angling across from the off stump line, and Hussey stays on the crease to shoulder arms.;
49.2;4;Kallis to Hussey, FOUR runs first four of the day, and it has been a while coming. Kallis offers width, there hasn't been much of that on offer so far today. Short too, allows Hussey to pull out his favourite shot, the rasping cut through backward point.;
49.1;1;Kallis to Ponting, 1 run slowish length ball, finishes too straight and Ponting tucks it to midwicket for a single.;
48.6;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run stunning ball, lands it back of a length and gets it to zip away a degree or so. That's all it took to beat Hussey's outside edge, he again pokes tentatively without quite getting the front foot across. Tough times for Australia..;
48.5;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run shortens the length with the last ball, not much sideways movement for Morne so far. Hussey isn't tempted into flirting with it, just yet.;
48.4;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run goes very full, but also very wide this time, and Hussey lets it go from the crease.;
48.3;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run shortens the length and gets the ball to go across him, Hussey stays on the crease and lets it go.;
48.2;2;Morkel to Hussey, 2 runs makes him play this time, Hussey check-drives into the covers where a forgettable fielding effort gives Hussey the second.;
48.1;?;Morkel to Hussey, no run and he's already pacier than Vernon, bounds in and gets a length ball to shape across Hussey, who lets it go.;
47.6;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run aha, a length ball stays madly low! Ponting was on the back foot and hopping to cover the line when he saw this torpedoing a foot lower than it should have been. He came down in a hurry and managed to keep it out. Wry smiles all around.;
47.5;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run heavy ball, Kallis bounces this in at 140 kph, Ponting stays out of the way.;
47.4;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run full and wide of off stump, Ponting resists the temptation to unfurl his trademark square drive.;
47.3;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run thumps this in open-chested from wide of the crease. 130 kph as it straightens, Ponting lets it go.;

46.5;?;Philander to Hussey, no run and he alternates the indipper with the away seamer. Hussey sees it wobble away outside off and leaves. High-quality cricket.;
46.4;?;Philander to Hussey, no run that came in, and bounced disconcertingly from a length, Hussey was looking to work it to the leg side, but it beat the shot to hit him on the thigh.;
46.3;?;Philander to Hussey, no run Vernon goes fuller, gets the ball to buzz across without moving off the seam, Hussey sees it well and lets it go.;
46.2;?;Philander to Hussey, no run a touch fuller, a loaded ball angling across, but Hussey doesn't bite.;
46.1;?;Philander to Hussey, no run Hussey stays back to a tempting length ball outside off, and lets it go.;
45.6;?;Steyn to Ponting, no run a strange shot there to a 136 kph short ball. It was too wide outside off and swinging away too, to make the pull shot a strict no-no. Ponting was shaping for it, then got into a poor position before seemingly bailing out of the stroke. He just waved his bat over the wrong line.;
45.5;1;Steyn to Hussey, 1 run Hussey's feet are a little awry at the moment. Again doesn't get forward to a ball he should have been leaning out to, and nudges off the inner half to square leg.;
45.4;?;Steyn to Hussey, no run gives him the bouncer at 137 kph, Hussey was looking to get forward, but quickly arrests the movement and ducks.;
45.3;?;Steyn to Hussey, no run once again Steyn gets it to straighten from a full length on off stump, Hussey gets forward and defends.;
45.2;?;Steyn to Hussey, no run stays back and defends from the crease to the off side this time.;
45.1;2;Steyn to Hussey, 2 runs ooh, 138 kph, that was a snake that had the pads and / or the stumps in its sights. Hussey didn't budget for the inward movement as he got the front foot down the track, but was lucky enough to get a thick inside edge to the leg side.;
44.6;?;Philander to Ponting, no run outwswinger to end the over, too short and wide enough for Ponting to leave.;
44.5;1;Philander to Hussey, 1 run The Huss is away finally, gets the front foot across and defends softly into the covers for a single.;
44.4;?;Philander to Hussey, no run goes even wider now, Hussey counts down one more ball to the end of this over.;
44.3;?;Philander to Hussey, no run easily negotiated this time, angled well across outside off stump, and Hussey leaves.;
44.2;1;Philander to Ponting, 1 run straight ball at 130 kph, Ponting works it to midwicket for one. Hussey faces his nemesis again.;
44.1;?;Philander to Ponting, no run short of a length, that stood up a touch more than Ponting seemed to expect, but he was still on top of the bounce as he defended to the leg side.;
43.6;1;Steyn to Ponting, 1 run 138 kph, holds its line and ends up on Ponting's hips for a polite tuck to the midwicket region for a single.;

41.5;?;Steyn to Ponting, no run beaten! Just as I type that, Ponting proves that jinxing still works. Having left balls closer to off stump, he thrusts the bat at this one needlessly as it whizzes beside him. The away seam is prodigious enough to miss the edge ...;

Clarke was pressing forward when he noticed it coming in, and was trying to cover the gap between bat and pad, with the former thrust in front of the body. Too late, the ball skidded in past the inside edge and burst through to disturb the castle. Clarke looks gutted, the ball just did enough to disturb the bails.

38.5;?;Philander to Ponting, no run 130 kph, landed on a McGrathesque area just outside off and the ball doesn't really take off. Ponting leaves it as it passes close to the stumps. The track has surely lost a bit of its carry ...;
