Data
6.05pm: Er, so how do you sum up that innings? It was helter skelter stuff, another very good Ageas Bowl pitch but Australia looked like they were going to easily get 350 at one stage; England will be delighted to have kept the target below 300, though 299 will still be a record chase here. Ben Stokes was the major beneficiary of Australia's bout of motion sickness but, spinners aside, the bowlers gave a decent account of themselves. We'll find out soon enough whether Shane Watson's (almost) one-man show or England's long batting order will carry the day - join us again in 30 minutes.
49.1;W;Rankin to McKay, OUT McKay steps to leg, Rankin follows him and the slog across the line goes up in the air, to be safely pouched by the man coming in from deep square leg! Boyd Rankin, the pick of the attack, has a wicket at last and Australia have been bowled out for less than 300;Clint McKay c Root b Rankin 5 (20m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 31.25;
48.6;4;Jordan to Fawad, FOUR runs shot! Jordan went full and straight but it was more half-volley than yorker and Fawad stepped away, crunched a drive past mid-off for four;
48.5;?;Jordan to Fawad, no run dug in short and at Fawad's bonce, he manages to jerk out of the way;
48.4;W;Jordan to Faulkner, OUT slightly back of a length and darting across Faulkner, Buttler throws himself down the leg side to take a sharp catch - was there a bit of glove on that? Umpire Dar thinks so but Faulkner immediately reviews. He thinks it flicked his sweater - and it did, but not before tickling the inside edge of the bat, Hot Spot clearly shows the mark and the decision is upheld. England have another;James Faulkner c ?Buttler b Jordan 10 (35m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 52.63;

47.6;1;Rankin to McKay, 1 run nurdles to midwicket, McKay wants two but won't get a second, meaning he keeps the strike;
47.5;?;Rankin to McKay, no run beaten again, another jaffa from Rankin, seaming and bouncing as McKay plays inside it, more through luck than judgement;
47.4;?;Rankin to McKay, no run shuffles across his stumps, tries to play to leg and gets a leading edge;
47.3;?;Rankin to McKay, no run lovely ball, too good for McKay, who swings wildly and misses;
47.2;?;Rankin to McKay, no run comes forward on the drive, not sure if that was a bump ball or straight off the bat but it clears the bowler and drops short of mid-off;

44.6;W;Stokes to Johnson, OUT tries to turn to leg again, leading edge and gone, caught and bowled! Stokes has five-for! Johnson departs with alacrity, having made just a couple, and England have now claimed 5 for 73 in 13 overs (which would look a whole lot better without that Watson assault on Root);Mitchell Johnson c & b Stokes 2 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
44.5;2;Stokes to Johnson, 2 runs leg-stump line, closes the face and works a couple through midwicket;
44.4;W;Stokes to Watson, OUT steps away, swings the arms ... and nicks off! There'll be a few sighs of relief on the England balcony, as Watson was just threatening to take the game away again. He was looking to hit down the ground here but it wasn't quite full enough, Watson played down slightly the wrong line, small deflection and comfortably held;Shane Watson c ?Buttler b Stokes 143 (174m 107b 12x4 6x6) SR: 133.64;

44.1;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run digs this in short, Faulkner springs back and blocks;

43.5;6;Root to Watson, SIX runs Watson is climbing into Root now, brutal hitting and he's undone about five overs of good work, launching another slog-sweep into the crowd... where it's caught;

43.4;6;Root to Watson, SIX runs tossed up and planted into the stands at deep midwicket, this is murderous stuff, right out of the middle;

40.6;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run line and length in the channel, shoulders arms this time;

35.2;W;Root to Bailey, OUT Bailey sweeps and misses, Buttler nudges off the bails and trots away to celebrate with Root - he seems pretty certain but the umpires send it upstairs to check. And the evidence is pretty clear, Bailey's foot stayed grounded just beyond his crease, he made no effort to get it back, so must have lost his bearings... This is going to be out, Root has done the trick, in slightly bizarre circumstances;George Bailey st ?Buttler b Root 4 (14m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57;
35.1;1;Root to Watson, 1 run tossed up from round the wicket, pushed wide of the bowler and Root can't quite prevent one;

31.6;W;Jordan to Clarke, OUT another chance to mid-off, Pietersen's there this time and takes the catch as Clarke splices a pull stroke. Tried to open up the off side again did Clarke but didn't become a great position from which to play a pull stroke, perhaps got hurried by Jordan and got nowhere near enough on the stroke and it looped to Pietersen who showed Rankin how to do it;Michael Clarke c Pietersen b Jordan 75 (96m 76b 10x4 1x6) SR: 98.68;
31.5;2;Jordan to Clarke, 2 runs off stump on a full length, struck up and over the infield, not perfectly timed but enough club to clear mid-off and extra-cover running back;

31.3;?;Jordan to Clarke, no run full length angled into the body, Clarke blocks it in the crease, trying to give himself a little room is Clarke;

We're going to start on time, despite the delay to the toss, and the teams are wandering out to the strains of "Jerusalem" for the umpteenth time this summer... Boyd Rankin has the ball in hand and Phillip Hughes is on strike in his first international appearance since the Lord's Test in July.
1.50pm: The pitch is the same one as used for the ODI with New Zealand earlier this summer, in which Martin Guptill scored 189 not out. It looks pretty hard and dry, no live grass on it and Nigel Gray, the head groundsman, expects it to play pretty well (that is, for the batsmen).
"Glad Wrighty is back in," says Simon. "Gives it some humpty up top and adds to the three-and-a-bit attack. Between him, Stokes, Ravi, Root and maybe KP we should be able to get the remaining 20 overs dealt with."
CharlieJ has some insight on England's new man: "I agree on Chris Jordan, as a Surrey supporter it is sad we could not keep him and help him make the most of his talent. It was a Surrey issue not his fault."
And James is today's wet blanket: "The way this series has gone so far, it would seem entirely right for it to be decided by D/L with a shortened game."
1.45pm: Well, well. England have arguably gone with just two specialist bowlers and four allrounders, which is about as far removed as is possible from their previous strategy, under Andy Flower, of playing specialists. Thoughts?
1.40pm: Australia have won the toss and will bat, Michael Clarke says he's 100% fit to contribute and wants to end the series on a high. There's been some late drama in the England camp, however, Ashley Giles dashing over to Eoin Morgan moments before the coin flip and they've made two changes: Jordan in for Finn, who has a "mild side strain" and Luke Wright replacing Jonathan Trott after he went down with a back spasm...
England 1 Michael Carberry, 2 Kevin Pietersen, 3 Luke Wright, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Joe Root, 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Jos Buttler (wk), 8 Ben Stokes, 9 Chris Jordan 10, James Tredwell, 11 Boyd Rankin
Australia 1 Aaron Finch, 2 Phillip Hughes, 3 Shane Watson, 4 Michael Clarke (capt), 5 George Bailey, 6 Adam Voges, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 James Faulkner, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Clint McKay, 11 Fawad Ahmed,
1.35pm: So, we've just seen Jordan presented with his England cap by Nasser - he'll be No. 231 in ODIs (provided there isn't a change of plan after the delay). The suggestion is that Steven Finn may have a side strain, so that would mean England sticking to the three-and-a-half men attack that has been the talking point of this series.
1.30pm: Disappointingly (but not entirely unexpectedly) a coastal squall has just swept in off the Solent, forcing the groundstaff to wheel on the covers. The toss will be delayed, though hopefully only for 10-15 minutes, with a strong wind ushering the clouds through.
Here's Mark Kidger: "If the Chris Jordan rumour is true, it is great news, although he is a specialist *RED* ball bowler, so it would follow recent England tradition. Definitely, if it's batting conditions today, England need the extra bowler." He's bowled pretty well in all formats for Sussex this season and, as well as being an excellent fielder, he can bat a bit too. It's an exciting selection.
1.25pm: Brother Gnasher, our man at the ground, has spotted Michael Clarke readying himself for coin-calling duties in the middle, so it looks like his back has been girdled up sufficiently to play. Nasser Hussain was the man who presented Jordan with his cap, apparently; no news as to whether he then called for a single that wasn't there.
1.20pm: Good afternoon, one and all, ye thrill seekers and banter lovers. The final international match of the English summer is upon us and we will shortly be delivered of team and toss news. Until then, nourish yourselves with our preview and prepare for the revelation that, contrary to the suggestions in that tablet of stone, England may be about to change their XI. Rumour from the ground is that Chris Jordan has been inducted into the holy order of one-day internationals - we will have confirmation from whomsoever is Sky's High Priest of the Toss shortly. I'm Alan Gardner and, in league with my fellow acolyte Alex Winter, we will bring enlightenment to the benighted one last time today.
 Innings Start
Less than a month until Australia are back in action, they get their one-day tour to India underway on October 10 with a T20 before seven ODIs. England have some time off before they travel down under for the return Ashes and the first Test gets underway on November 21 in Brisbane. That's the next time you'll hear from Monty and I, we're off for a well-deserved graze in the shires. See you soon...

So that's all she wrote for the summer of 2013. It started with New Zealand causing an upset in the one-dayers before England flexed their muscles in the Tests. Then came the Champions Trophy that was cracking entertainment and a thrilling final between England and India that the hosts managed to throw away. But the big one was the Ashes, it wasn't vintage but we had four highly competitive matches and England won the moments when it mattered to take the Urn 3-0. Some T20 and one-day action has closed things out and Australia are going home with a consolation NatWest series win.

Presentation time. Out come the medallions for all and sundry. What do you reckon they do with these random medals just for showing up? Jamie Overton will get one and hasn't done anything. Man of the Match is Shane Watson surprise surprise, an extra medal and champagne for him. "That was a lot of fun, he says. "We haven't had much success on this tour so it's nice to come away with the win. I capitalised on England's fourth and fifth bowlers, we though that was the weaker part of their team. It's been an amazing tour in the end, things have changed for the better and I think everyone's very excited about what lies ahead.

Man of the Series goes to the winning Australian captain Michael Clarke, for his ton in Manchester and good showing today.

Eoin Morgan: "We did really well to restrict them to under 300 but we lost wickets regularly and no-one played a big innings for us. We haven't stuck to our guns and built up front. But we've learned a lot from the young prospect coming through. It's been really interesting for me as captain. I've enjoyed the young guys coming through and I'm getting back my own form."

The winning, yes winning skipper Clarke: "It was extremely cold but we hung in there. Shane Watson today was outstanding, to be able to play like that in what was a final for us was a great effort, and they way we bowled was a very good performances today. this series to a lot of people doesn't matter much for us it matters a great deal. We've worked extremely hard and it's a nice reward. We go to India now and hopefully we can perform well, we want to the be the No. 1 one-day side in the world. We've had a great time and the people of the UK have treated us very well." Despite the very cold conditions, out comes the champagne as Calrke holds aloft the trophy.

And like at Old Trafford, England never threatened to chase down the target. Two calamitous run-outs hampered their cause and they had Michael Carberry and especially Joe Root looking out of touch and struggling to time the ball. It was Eoin Morgan once again that was required to get the chase going. He did but only for so long and Jos Buttler and Ravi Bopara, despite looking pretty good in cameos, had far too much to do. Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay and James Faulkner were again excellent for Australia.

Today, for the third time this season, the visitors have enjoyed the conditions far better at the Ageas Bowl. A hard, flat wicket has served up plenty of runs and Shane Watson scored most of them. He was at his brutal best striking 12 fours and six sixes in 143 that motored Australia along having won the toss, Michael Clarke also played another tidy innings and even though they again collapsed at the end of the innings, 298 gave them plenty to bowl at.

There we have it then, end of the series, end of the summer and Australia have won by 49 runs a pretty comprehensive victory in this final rubber. They have something to take home with them, it was a pretty torrid tour but in this NatWest series they have got themselves together nicely and played some decent stuff and deserved to take the series, albeit only over three matches. They take the series 2-1 with two easy wins here and in what was the first game at Old Trafford.

39.6;?;Johnson to Jordan, no run fuller length, Jordan back on his stumps keeping it out up the pitch;
39.5;?;Johnson to Jordan, no run tighter line and blocked in the crease up on the off side;

39.2;?;Johnson to Jordan, no run back of a length just outside off, dabbed off the back foot into the covers;
39.1;W;Johnson to Bopara, OUT steps to leg and slaps straight to extra cover and now England are dead. Bopara nailed it, creamed it right out of the meat of the bat but couldn't evade extra-cover who's taken a very sharp chance at head height with two hands, a cold night is not the time for those chances but that was very well held. Bopara can't believe it because he couldn't have timed that any better but he's got to go and two wickets at the start of spells have killed any hope England still had;Ravi Bopara c Voges b Johnson 62 (100m 66b 5x4 0x6) SR: 93.93;
38.6;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run played slightly across it but gets it back to the bowler who shies at the stumps and Wade is forced into a full-length dive to his right to save four overthrows;
38.5;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run forward just outside off stump, cry for lbw because it was played with bat and pad together, not out given by Bailey, Clarke goes for another review it was pad first but it looks outside the line, yep Hawk Eye has it striking Stokes comfortably outside the line of off stump, another decent decision from Rob Bailey;
38.4;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run finds the ring again with a firm back foot punch, it was there to hit with a little bit of width offered outside off;
38.3;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run back of a length just outside off, a firm back foot punch but finds cover;
38.2;2;Faulkner to Stokes, 2 runs short of a length and pulled firmly through midwicket, wide of the sweeper so they get two;
38.1;W;Faulkner to Buttler, OUT full and straight through him stumps parted and a killer blow for England, think Buttler just played around one, done by the angle perhaps. It was around the wicket from Faulkner, angled in to the stumps and Buttler tried to swing it down the ground and missed, is that England's last chance walking off?;Jos Buttler b Faulkner 42 (53m 37b 4x4 0x6) SR: 113.51;

37.5;1;Watson to Buttler, 1 run straight delivery and Buttler flicks down to long leg;
37.4;4;Watson to Buttler, FOUR runs touch full and Buttler is able to free his arms with a shimmy outside leg stump and nails the lofted drive, awesome timing over mid-off;
37.3;1;Watson to Bopara, 1 run backs to leg and aims through the off side, mistimed and finds extra cover;
37.2;2;Watson to Bopara, 2 runs tried to swing over the leg side, didn't really get it at all but a thick edge runs in front of square leg and they charge back for second;
37.1;2;Watson to Bopara, 2 runs steps to leg and cracks a drive wide of the cover sweeper, it was a comfy two even before the fielder slipped;
36.6;2;McKay to Buttler, 2 runs forward and knocked through square leg, deep backward square has to go to his left a long way and they get two again;
36.5;4;McKay to Buttler, FOUR runs ah lovely, brings out the ramp and pulls it off from outside off to fine leg;
36.4;1;McKay to Bopara, 1 run tried to pull off the front foot, didn't really time it and found deep square with a gentle roll;
36.3;1;McKay to Buttler, 1 run this time Buttler has knocked it too close to deep square leg so just the one;
36.2;2;McKay to Buttler, 2 runs same again, gently dropped towards midwicket, McKay took off in pursuit himself but couldn't save the second;
36.1;2;McKay to Buttler, 2 runs length on the stumps, dropped into midwicket and three men are back on the fence over there so they can charge back for the second;
35.6;1;Watson to Buttler, 1 run gently dropped towards point from the crease and they set off for a darting single;
35.5;1;Watson to Bopara, 1 run length delivery on the stumps, Bopara clips through square leg, just a single available;
35.4;1;Watson to Buttler, 1 run back on his stumps and clipping a length ball just outside off backward of point for a sharp single;
35.3;1;Watson to Bopara, 1 run down the wicket and nails a cover drive but extra-cover gets down to his right and saves very well, Bopara creamed that;
35.2;?;Watson to Bopara, no run forward and dropped towards mid-on, Bailey hares in from midwicket and dives, picks up and throws the stumps down in a brilliant piece of work - again - Buttler has dived back in safely though. Third umpire Ravi has taken a few days to give it not out even though it was so obvious;
35.1;?;Watson to Bopara, no run full on the stumps, driven back to the bowler;
34.6;1;Fawad to Bopara, 1 run touch short, spinning away and forced off the back foot in front of square to the sweeper - half-century for Bopara, but only half the job done, as yet;

33.3;?;Watson to Bopara, no run takes the pace off, Bopara works the ball to midwicket;
33.2;1;Watson to Buttler, 1 run good length outside off, comes forward this time and drops one into the covers;
33.1;4;Watson to Buttler, FOUR runs strays down the leg side first ball, Buttler just give it a tap on the backside as it passes and that will be four more to fine leg - fifty partnership up, too;
32.6;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run short again, connects with a fierce pull but picks out the midwicket fielder;
32.5;4;Faulkner to Bopara, FOUR runs short, maybe a slower ball as well and Bopara toes the ball round the corner, well behind the man at deep square and that's a pick-me-up four for England;

31.2;?;Watson to Bopara, no run on the stumps, nudged to midwicket;
31.1;?;Watson to Bopara, no run length ball, whipped firmly to leg but there's a brilliant diving stop at midwicket and a decent throw at the stumps as Bopara returns to base too;
30.6;1;Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run Faulkner's Kiss-like, tongue-out appeal gets an airing as Bopara is hit on the knee pushing forwards, it was pad before bat but the umpire isn't interested. Clarke eventually declines to review and it's a good decision as the ball wasn't coming back enough to hit off stump;
30.5;4;Faulkner to Bopara, FOUR runs Bopara comes forward, this is an edge but it flies well of the keeper and runs very fine, another useful boundary;

25.5;4;Voges to Buttler, FOUR runs drops a little short and Buttler shows just how powerfully he can hit the ball, throwing his hands through a cut shot, terrific bat speed and it beats the dive of deep cover to find the rope;

25.3;1;Voges to Bopara, 1 run driven down the ground to long-off;

25.1;W;Voges to Morgan, OUT slides the ball across the advancing Morgan and Wade completes a simple stumping! Big wicket for Voges, that could well be the game. The bowler maybe saw him coming, Voges tossed it a little wider, beat the outside edge and the rest is a Michael Jackson LP;Eoin Morgan st ?Wade b Voges 30 (56m 39b 3x4 0x6) SR: 76.92;
24.6;?;Watson to Bopara, no run tight line on middle and off, tapped to leg;

22.6;?;McKay to Morgan, no run beats the bat, a cutter from McKay and it jumps off a length, Morgan does well to drop pull out and let it through;
22.5;1;McKay to Bopara, 1 run comes forward and drops short on the off side, they pinch one more;
22.4;1lb;McKay to Morgan, 1 leg bye McKay appeals as Morgan is hit on the pad, it was too high, off the thigh and runs away towards point;

21.1;?;Voges to Bopara, no run tossed up, pitching on off stump and sliding on with the arm, beats Bopara's prod and hits him on the back pad ... Aleem Dar thinks about it for a moment and then raises his finger. Bopara doesn't look very confident but decides to review and Hawk-Eye shows it going on to miss leg stump. Well, that looked like it would shave a bit timber but, no. Might have bounced too much, as well;
20.6;1;McKay to Bopara, 1 run length delivery wide of the stumps, runs another single behind square;

16.5;W;Faulkner to Morgan, OUT drops one short, there's a direct hit... and Wright is run out, brilliant bit of work from Bailey! Wright is guilty of ball watching here, Bailey swooped in from the covers, threw on the move, only a stump and a half to aim at but the contact is just enough to nudge the bails off and Wright didn't run his bat in. If he has, it would have been mighty close;Luke Wright run out (Bailey) 0 (4m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
16.4;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run tapped into the off side, no run;
16.3;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run edged and dropped, Watson has shelled it at slip, diving to his right, it went in and then out. Faulkner looks pretty cheesed off;

15.6;?;Johnson to Wright, no run length delivery on off stump, Wright pushes it back up the wicket;
15.5;W;Johnson to Root, OUT full and wide of off stump, Root pokes at it without moving his feet and gets a thick inside edge onto his middle stump and that ends a very average innings from Root, he's looked rather out of touch today and played a poor stroke there. On a better day that would have been driven handsomely through the covers but a tentative prod has seen a thick inside edge smash into middle stump;Joe Root b Johnson 21 (62m 36b 0x4 0x6) SR: 58.33;

13.3;4;Fawad to Morgan, FOUR runs down the track and a huge swipe gets a thick inside edge past leg stump and it races away from short long leg, very very lucky for Morgan;
13.2;?;Fawad to Morgan, no run blocked from the crease around off stump;
13.1;1;Fawad to Root, 1 run floated up on middle and leg, played forward and dropped into midwicket for a quick single;

12.5;W;Faulkner to Carberry, OUT full and straight, wraps Carberry on the pads, huge cry for lbw, not out given but Clarke goes for the review. I reckon this is a good effort, Carberry got a long way down the pitch but it did look straight as he missed playing across it. No mark on Hot Spot and Hawk Eye has it crashing into middle stump, good review and Carberry is gone. He tried to shuffle across and create some angle for himself but missed. That he was down the track and possibly outside the line created enough doubt for Rob Bailey but the review proved it was a good shout;Michael Carberry lbw b Faulkner 30 (53m 50b 4x4 0x6) SR: 60;

0.1;?;McKay to Carberry, no run forward on off stump to block into the cover, McKay right back on it;

Michael Carberry will be hoping for a few on his home ground. He'll be feeling much better after his half-century in Cardiff. Kevin Pietersen is yet to fire in this series, can he do so here on what is a cracking deck. Hat-trick hero from Cardiff, Clint McKay, to bowl from the Northern End...

Time flies and the players are on their way out for the last time in 2013 and England need 299 to take the series after a spirited fightback with the ball.
