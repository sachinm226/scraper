Australia have battled their way to 266, largely thanks to Glenn Maxwell and an anchoring innings from Aaron Finch. A lot of Pakistan's bowling was very good, but the fielding let them down again. They will, however, know what they need to do with the bat rather than setting a total. Liam will be back with your for the start of the chase. During the break, you can pop over and follow that IPL-thingy

25.3;1;Haris Sohail to Stoinis, 1 run Stoinis appears to have clipped his own ankle with the bat, and he seems to be in some pain. He skipped out to get to the pitch, but his bat came down behind the pad and jammed into his ankle as he tried to work to leg.

23.1;W;Haris Sohail to Handscomb, OUT flight, drift and turn!

19.4;?;Haris Sohail to Finch, no run Haris is flighting them much more than Imad would have, slowing it up, and Finch keeps hitting the field;

So Pakistan have an opening. A different contest now
 Innings Start
10.55pm Zampa has a career-best 4 for 43 and Australia have wrapped up a series win - their sixth in a row against Pakistan. Australia were setting today, and their 266 for 6 was built around Finch's 90, with Maxwell's breezy 71 providing the coda. With the pitch juiced up by the persistent drizzle, Cummins burst through the top order and Zampa mopped up the tail.
"It wasn't the easiest wicket to start on," says Glenn Maxwell. "Once I got through that, it got easier. To win six in a row, to win with this team, has been amazing. We're peaking at the right time. We've been really focused about what we want to do here. We want to build on this momentum. [The ball] is coming out alright. It's been a continual build for our team since last year, and we're starting to get it right."
Pat Cummins is the Player of the Match
"It was a little bit greasy out there underfoot, and it took me a few over to get used to it," says Cummins. "Me and [Behrendorff] had a good partnership, and they nicked a few. It felt alright, thanks to management and Finchy they gave me a couple of games off, and it was nice to come back today fresh. Fresh legs helps [in the field too]."
"The total was in our hands, but when you're playing in Abu Dhabi it's always tough, anything over 250," says Shoaib Malik. "Keeping wickets and going deep in the game, that's where you create the chance, but we couldn't do that. The Aussie bowlers were seaming and swinging the ball around. If you give couple of chances to a good batsman, then expect to chase something big. Getting opportunities and grabbing them is the key of the game. We are trying to give all the players chances so selection committee and team management have a better picture in front of them. Every game is important. We have two more opportunities. If we win two games, we have something in our pocket."
"We've played some consistent cricket," says Aaron Finch. "We've been building up and doing the basics well. Any time you can beat India and Pakistan in their home conditions is good. We're playing spin a lot better than we have in the past. Handscomb played a good innings before he was knocked over by a good ball. Partnerships don't allow the opposition to get on top. That's been an improvement. Maxwell and Handscomb both played great knocks. As a captain, it's very hard to set fields to guys like that."
Finch on missing out on his hundred: "I got a bit impatient. I got a bit greedy. I was struggling out there to be honest. I don't know how many times I hit the guy at cover. If we had lost tonight, it would have been my fault for batting so slow. But we ended up getting a good score on a difficult wicket. The rain put a bit of moisture in the wicket, and Cummins and Behrendorff exploited that. Our spinners were incredibly good again."
And that's all from your commentary team, Andrew McGlashan and Liam Brickhill. Australia will go to the fourth ODI in Dubai on Friday with the series in the bag. Pakistan have two more chances to get it right. Until next time, goodbye!
Najeem Akbar: "How you expect a team to win when they play 150+ dot balls in 44.4 overs?"
Mohammad Ehtesh: "We can see Imad Wasim's genuine all rounding capabilities as well as his mindset for finishing each innings. When Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman and potentially Asif Ali in for the WC, Imad should be in a decent position to finish off games on a high! "
Jesuran Jonatha: "Australia also have 150+ dot balls" -- Fair point, but they also hit more boundaries and ran many more twos

44.4;W;Zampa to Mohammad Hasnain, OUT there's a review. Zampa floats a googly up high and it rushes in to beat Hasnain's inside edge and hit him on the back leg. The appeal is turned down, but they ask for a review. Three reds, and he's gone!;Mohammad Hasnain lbw b Zampa 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
44.3;W;Zampa to Junaid, OUT Zampa has his third! Tossed up high and Junaid takes the bait, slogging wildly to send a swirling top edge into the air.

21.5;1w;Cummins to Umar Akmal, 1 wide that's a bit wild...a short ball fired miles down the leg side, think that just came out wrong;
21.4;?;Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run outside off, hood length, left alone;
21.3;?;Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run full outside off, nice carry through to Carey;
21.2;1;Cummins to Malik, 1 run short of a length, gets on his toes and punches into a gap at cover;
21.1;?;Cummins to Malik, no run good length at off stump, defended om the front foot;
20.6;?;Maxwell to Umar Akmal, no run he needs to be careful there, playing back and exposing his stumps to a pretty full delivery. He's able to drive it away safely this time;
20.5;?;Maxwell to Umar Akmal, no run played to the leg side;
20.4;W;Maxwell to Imam-ul-Haq, OUT given lbw, but he's called for the review! Back of a length, slides on with the arm, don't think there's any edge so it's all about the height. It is at the top of the pad, but is hitting the top of the stumps. That's very out;Imam-ul-Haq lbw b Maxwell 46 (72b 2x4 2x6) SR: 63.88;
20.3;1;Maxwell to Malik, 1 run on off stump, goes straight on, pushed square to the off side;
20.2;?;Maxwell to Malik, no run worked off the pads but straight to square leg;
20.1;1;Maxwell to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run full on off stump, leans forward and dabs towards cover;
19.6;3;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, 3 runs and again, finds the edge, he's coming forward this time, goes to ground and wide of slip then runs towards third man;
19.5;?;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, no run excellent delivery, spins and takes the outside edge but doesn't carry to sllp;
19.4;2;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, 2 runs touch shorter outside off, square cuts nicely through point and it's another brace;
19.3;2;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, 2 runs flicks this from off stump to deep midwicket where the second can't be stopped;
19.2;1;Lyon to Malik, 1 run this one turns from outside off and takes the inside edge as he plays forward;

18.4;2;Maxwell to Imam-ul-Haq, 2 runs leans forward and drives a wide delivery nicely through point;

18.1;?;Maxwell to Malik, no run works a shorter delivery into midwicket;
18.1;1w;Maxwell to Malik, 1 wide round the wicket, wide down the leg side although it did turn;

17.2;?;Lyon to Malik, no run good length outside off, defended;
17.1;2;Lyon to Malik, 2 runs nicely driven through the off side;
16.6;6;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, SIX runs biffed onto the grass banks! It's slightly short, and Imam picks up the length very quickly, shimmying down as he often does and swiping it powerfully over the boundary;
16.5;3;Stoinis to Malik, 3 runs drifting in towards the pads, and Malik clips him smartly out to deep midwicket, where Cummins comes charging around the boundary and slides to stop it, saving a run. Committed stuff;
16.4;?;Stoinis to Malik, no run floated up outside off, but Malik's weight is back so he's late into his drive;
16.3;?;Stoinis to Malik, no run Stoinis attacks the stumps, but he's kept out by Malik;
16.2;?;Stoinis to Malik, no run tucked into the leg side this time, but mid on is there to stop the run. Lyon in that position;
16.1;?;Stoinis to Malik, no run full, but it's driven straight to mid off;
15.6;?;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, no run and solid defence ends the over;
15.5;?;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, no run and big spin this time! In fact, there's an appeal - though not a very expansive one as Australia think he's edged it to Carey - and Michael Gough's finger shoots up! Imam doesn't think he's hit it, and sends it upstairs, reviewing. Gosh, replays show a massive gap between the ball and the bat, that's definitely not out, and the decision is over-turned. The bat might have hit the pad, which is what the on-field umpire heard;
15.4;?;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, no run there's a yelp of excitement from Carey as Lyon gets one to rush on, but it's inside edged onto the pad;
15.3;?;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, no run nicely flighted, the ball lands on middle and leg and is met with solid defence;
15.2;1;Lyon to Malik, 1 run Malik lunges forward to place a drive into the gap at cover, a single the result;
15.1;1;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run full, and it's flicked off the toes for a single;
14.6;?;Stoinis to Malik, no run Malik is forward to defend into the covers;
14.5;?;Stoinis to Malik, no run Stoinis hits the seam and gets it to go like a legcutter, but Malik wasn't interested as it was outside off and leaves well alone;
14.4;1;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run flicked off the pad and out to deep midwicket for a single;
14.3;?;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, no run seaming in off the track, Imam falling over to off a little as he over-balances in defence;
14.2;?;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Imam comes half forward, tucking defensively to point. That's the 60th dot of the innings;
14.1;1;Stoinis to Malik, 1 run Malik drives straight, without much power but with the placement for a single;
13.6;1;Lyon to Malik, 1 run glanced off the hip, slightly uppishly but well away from any fielder;
13.5;1;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run more bounce than turn, but it's negotiated as Imam presses to cover;
13.4;?;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, no run arm ball, and has it hit pad first? There's half an appeal. Umpire says no;
13.3;1;Lyon to Malik, 1 run glanced with the spin behind square leg;
13.2;1;Lyon to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run punched in front of point, off the back foot, and they're through for one;

12.5;1;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run angled down to third man for one;
12.4;?;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Stoinis reverts to length, Imam pushing to point;
12.4;5w;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, 5 wide surprise bouncer! But it's also taken Carey by surprise, or at leas the extra bounce is too much for him as the ball loops over the batsman, over the keeper and down to the boundary;
12.3;?;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Stoinis aims this one much fuller, Imam digging it out to mid on;
12.2;1;Stoinis to Malik, 1 run Malik whips his wrists over a length delivery to collect a single to midwicket;
12.1;1;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run Imam shuffles across and flicks off his pads, but it's just the one;
11.6;?;Behrendorff to Malik, no run Malik hops into a defensive poke to end the over;
11.5;?;Behrendorff to Malik, no run a length delivery shoots across Malik's bows as he raises his hands into a leave;
11.4;1;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run short on off stump, and Imam rolls his wrists over a pull to deep midwicket;
11.3;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Behrendorff keeps it short of a length, Imam defending it back to him;
11.2;6;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, SIX runs Imam breaks the shackles, shuffling down to get close to a length delivery and hammering it high and handsome over long on - first boundary for 45 balls, and it's a big 'un;
11.1;1;Behrendorff to Malik, 1 run angled down just outside off, and it's chopped through gully for one;
10.6;?;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, no run keeps slightly low on off stump, but Imam gets his bat down in time to keep it out;

10.4;1;Stoinis to Malik, 1 run nipping in off the seam, and it's nudged to midwicket;
10.3;?;Stoinis to Malik, no run wicket-to-wicket stuff from Stoinis, and Malik defends;
10.2;1;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run angled down to third man for one;
10.1;?;Stoinis to Imam-ul-Haq, no run full and angling across Imam, who keeps an eye on it as he leaves alone;
9.6;?;Behrendorff to Malik, no run punched firmly off the back foot, but straight to cover;
9.5;?;Behrendorff to Malik, no run the nip-backer from Behrendorff, and it beats Malik's glance to hit him on the thigh;
9.4;?;Behrendorff to Malik, no run angled across Malik, on a length, and he defends back to the bowler;
9.3;1;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run a touch of seam movement in to him, but Imam works with it to pick up a single to fine leg;
9.2;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run just short of a good length, but nicely straight and Imam is a little cramped for room as he defends;
9.1;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Behrendorff hits a length, on off stump, and Imam defends to cover;
8.6;1;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run Imam thrusts his hands out at a rising delivery outside off, running the ball down to third man. A gully might have been useful there;
8.5;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run dug in short at 142km/h, Imam ducking well under the bouncer;
8.4;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run sharp yorker, zoning in on the base of off stump before Imam jabs to keep it out;
8.3;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Cummins keeps it in the channel, Imam defending from the crease;
8.2;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Imam props half forward into a defensive push, "no run!" is the call;

7.6;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run full and seaming away outside off. Imam steps into a watchful leave;
7.5;2;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, 2 runs too straight, and he's milked in front of square on the leg side for a brace;
7.4;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run appeal for lbw! This one snaked in to him off the track to hit him on the pad. The umpire says no, and there's a bit of discussion ... but they decide against a review. It did look high, hitting him above the roll;
7.3;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Imam walks into a firm drive, but finds mid off;
7.2;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Behrendorff hits the seam, the ball moving away from the left hander off the track. But it's easily left alone;
7.1;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run seaming in off a length, and Imam defends;
6.6;W;Cummins to Rizwan, OUT past the edge! Or has he got him? Australia appeal, Cummins is convinced, and likewise convinces Finch to take a review when the umpire says no. Kumar Dharmasena is the third umpire, and he notes a sound as ball passes bat. And ultra edge shows a spike! The decision is over-turned, and Pakistan are three down. A century for Rizwan last time, and a duck tonight;Mohammad Rizwan c ?Carey b Cummins 0 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
6.5;?;Cummins to Rizwan, no run wider of off, and it's left alone;
6.4;?;Cummins to Rizwan, no run some seam movement straight away, nipping in to hit Rizwan on the thigh;
6.3;W;Cummins to Haris Sohail, OUT another edge! The plan is the same, and Cummins executes it to perfection to get another one. He angles it in, seams it away, and Haris goes fishing outside off to send a regulation edge through to Marsh at first slip. A regulation chance, chest high;Haris Sohail c Marsh b Cummins 1 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
6.2;1;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run Imam hops over one that seams in to him, collecting a single through square leg;
6.1;1;Cummins to Haris Sohail, 1 run tucked into space on the leg side;
5.6;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run tapped defensively to gully, and it's another maiden;
5.5;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run in the channel, and Imam's nuggety defence keeps it out;
5.4;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run this one goes the other way off the seam, jagging in to him to take the inside edge onto the pad and raise some excitement behind the bat;
5.3;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run and again! Imam steps into a tentative push but the left-armer hits the seam and beats the edge. There's no bat on it, but it doesn't carry to the keeper;
5.2;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run that's a corker! Behrendorff stands the seam up and gets it to nip away and past the edge of Imam's poke;
5.1;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run on a length, and tight on off stump. Imam defends;
4.6;?;Cummins to Haris Sohail, no run past the inside edge! The ball was full and angled into him, Haris wafting at it with a flat-footed drive. The angle takes it through the gate, and Cummins completes a wicket maiden;
4.5;?;Cummins to Haris Sohail, no run another leave from Haris, whose judgment outside off holds firm;
4.4;?;Cummins to Haris Sohail, no run this one angles in from outside off and it's slightly closer to the stumps, but Haris is in no danger as he hops into a leave;
4.3;?;Cummins to Haris Sohail, no run pushed through outside off, but too wide to force him to play;
4.2;W;Cummins to Masood, OUT snaffled by a diving Handscomb at slip! Cummins gets the ball to straighten on Shan from around the stumps. The line makes him play, the movement finds the edge, and Handscomb at the solitary slip dives to his left to get a hand under the ball inches from the turf. It's an excellent, sharp slip catch, and Australia have drawn blood;Shan Masood c Handscomb b Cummins 2 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22;
4.1;?;Cummins to Masood, no run angling in from outside off, Shan defending to point;
3.6;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run punched defensively to cover;
3.5;4;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs slashed through cover point! This boundary will help to get them ticking;
3.4;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run hopping defence sends the ball trickling into the leg side;
3.3;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Behrendorff aims for the channel, Imam stepping into a watchful forward defensive;
3.2;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Imam lets a full, wide one go outside off;
3.1;1;Behrendorff to Masood, 1 run neatly worked off the pads by Shan, but there's protection in the deep;
2.6;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run short and rising outside off, Imam opting out of a pull shot at the last moment;
2.5;1;Cummins to Masood, 1 run squirting off the inside edge as Shan fends awkwardly from the crease, the ball bouncing between his legs but away from the stumps into the leg side. It definitely skidded on;
2.4;?;Cummins to Masood, no run on a length, in the channel, and Shan chops to cover;
2.3;1;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run slightly too straight, and he's worked off the hip down to fine leg;
2.2;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Cummins immediately pulls his length back again, and this one's left alone;
2.1;4;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs laced through cover point! Neat work from Imam, who spotted one in the slot and stepped into a crunchy square drive;
1.6;?;Behrendorff to Masood, no run shaping down the leg side, and they find a single off the pad;
1.5;?;Behrendorff to Masood, no run Shan comes half forward, defending a fuller one slightly away from his body;
1.4;1;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run Imam uses the width and the pace to collect a single down to third man;
1.3;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Behrendorff floats this one up outside off, Imam shouldering arms;
1.2;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run he's starting to find his radar now, and just a hint of shape away from the bat outside off. But Imam defends solidly from the crease;
1.1;?;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, no run this one pitches closer to a middle stump line, and it's defended back down the track;
1.1;1w;Behrendorff to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 wide Behrendorff shares the early duties, but his first ball is sprayed down the leg side;
0.6;?;Cummins to Masood, no run Cummins keeps it in the channel, and Shan's happy to let this one go too;
0.5;?;Cummins to Masood, no run bursting across Shan at 142km/h, the left hander raising his hands to leave. Good pace, and an upright seam;
0.4;1;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run Imam's off the mark with a flick off his pads. He might have chanced a second, but he slipped slightly while turning at the non-striker's end. It's greasy out there;
0.3;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run Cummins hits the splice off a length, Imam right behind it to defend;
0.2;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run just short of a good length, and Imam is up on his tip toes to defend to gully;
0.1;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run pace and carry through to the keeper with the hard new ball. It bursts off a length outside off, Imam whipping his bat inside the line as it passed him;

7.28pm The drizzle appears to have moved off for now, and the Australians spill onto the outfield ahead of their defence of 266. Pakistan have to chase that number down to keep the series alive. Imam ul Haq will face the first ball. Shan Masood's at the other end. And the returning Pat Cummins will open the bowling. Two slips in position
Yasir Lodhi: "Little bit of drizzle will help Pak as the ball will skid on and come on to the bat relatively better."
