Data
2.33pm So, an innings dominated by three centurions. Australia are in command again at the SCG.
134.6;W;Azhar Ali to Starc, OUT what a catch. Lovely take from Mohammad Rizwan. Australia have declared too. Wahab is injured in the process too. That was always Rizwan's catch, not sure what Wahab was doing. It was the full, flat dart on leg. Starc was through his stroke and the ball just lobbed up towards deep midwicket. Wahab, at deep square leg, and Rizwan, from deep midwicket, sprinted in. Rizwan's eyes were always on the ball, Wahab's too. Not sure if there was a call. Rizwan hangs on, while Wahab makes contact with Rizwan and falls over.;Mitchell Starc c sub (Mohammad Rizwan) b Azhar Ali 16 (13m 11b 0x4 2x6) SR: 145.45;
134.5;6;Azhar Ali to Starc, SIX runs eeks. Flat delivery on off, in Starc's arc and the heave sends the ball way over midwicket;
134.4;W;Azhar Ali to Wade, OUT and another one falls. Flat delivery from Azhar and full. Maybe a touch too full for Wade to be sweeping. Fails to get over the line. Takes a thick leading edge and carries to short fine leg. All eyes were on Azam considering Pakistan's fielding woes, but he settles safely underneath and takes the catcg;Matthew Wade c Babar Azam b Azhar Ali 29 (50m 33b 2x4 0x6) SR: 87.87;

134.1;1;Azhar Ali to Wade, 1 run flight down leg, Wade lofts the ball towards long-on. Mis-timed;
133.6;?;Wahab Riaz to Starc, no run 147 kph, another spearing yorker but it isn't straight. Starc doesn't get his bat down in time;
133.5;?;Wahab Riaz to Starc, no run slower bouncer outside off, Starc is through the stroke, bails out;

133.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Starc, no run drifts down leg, 141 kph. Starc hurried out of the way. Wahab comes into his own in conditions like these;
133.2;1;Wahab Riaz to Wade, 1 run low full toss on middle, pushed down to long-on;
133.1;?;Wahab Riaz to Wade, no run spears in a yorker outside off, beats the bat;
132.6;6;Azhar Ali to Starc, SIX runs whack. Another googly outside off, Starc gets down on one knee and slogs the ball way over long-on, typical Starc swing;
132.5;1;Azhar Ali to Wade, 1 run short delivery on middle, another wrong 'un. Concerned not to bowl in the batsman's arc. Pulled to square leg;

132.1;2;Azhar Ali to Wade, 2 runs short outside off, another wrong 'un. Pulled to deep midwicket for a couple;
77.6;?;Yasir Shah to Renshaw, no run outside the leg stump now, easy for Renshaw as he foes back and tucks it to midwicket;
77.5;?;Yasir Shah to Renshaw, no run goes back and punched the ball after it turns to midwicket;
77.4;?;Yasir Shah to Renshaw, no run long appeal, finger goes up for lbw and Renshaw reviews straightaway! It was a good delivery, no doubt, turned in just a bit after pitching as Renshaw pushed forward. But there's a clear inside edge before it hits the pad and the decision is overturned. Some hope emerged for Pakistan but faded quickly;
77.3;?;Yasir Shah to Renshaw, no run outside off, he reverse paddles it towards short third man;
77.2;1;Yasir Shah to Handscomb, 1 run pitches it shorter now so the batsmen goes back and opens up to turn it to square leg for one;
77.1;?;Yasir Shah to Handscomb, no run tossed up, he shuffles down to take the ball on the full and drives gently to mid-off;
76.6;1;Wahab Riaz to Handscomb, 1 run another steer to third man for one, 145 kph;
76.5;2;Wahab Riaz to Handscomb, 2 runs dabbed to third man this time. Back of a length and wide. Imran dives to his left to save runs;
76.4;4;Wahab Riaz to Handscomb, FOUR runs intentionally pushed this full and wide, Handscomb saw the length early, his eyes lit up. Transferred his weight into the ball and delectably drilled a square drive through point;

76.2;1;Wahab Riaz to Renshaw, 1 run another poor delivery, on the pads and clipped through square leg for one;

131.6;?;Wahab Riaz to Starc, no run definite reverse swing. 146 kph, yorker outside off. Goes through bat and pad;
131.5;W;Wahab Riaz to Handscomb, OUT a wide yorker outside off, some reverse maybe? Moving away late. Guided to deep point. Oh wait, the leg bail is dislodged. The third umpire is being called for. Never seen that before. Sarfraz lets out a tired yelp of "how's that." Handscomb went really deep in the crease, and had to stretch out for that. In trying to get to the ball from his position outside leg, his bat swing just grazed the leg stump and the leg bail came off before he made contact. I actually couldn't see discernible contact, but it was so close it could have just been the air from the bat swing knocking the leg bail off? Either way, it was definitely out and Handscomb is given. End of a superb innings. Snicko has a spike.;Peter Handscomb hit wicket b Wahab Riaz 110 (319m 205b 9x4 0x6) SR: 53.65;

130.6;?;Azhar Ali to Handscomb, no run 86 kph, phew, that was close. Such fine margins. Flat delivery outside off, Handscomb misses his pull and the ball somehow doesn't hit off stump;
130.5;1;Azhar Ali to Wade, 1 run swept down to short fine leg;
130.4;3;Azhar Ali to Handscomb, 3 runs a fine paddle sweep down to fine leg for an easy three. Clever batting, just manipulating the field. No major boundary-striking;

75.3;4;Yasir Shah to Renshaw, FOUR runs out comes the reverse sweep. Shot. Safe. No fielder there, gets a flighted delivery outside off and then just calmly executes the stroke through third man. This guy looking more assured in run-scoring now;

75.1;?;Yasir Shah to Renshaw, no run 84 kph, Renshaw comes down the crease and flicks to midwicket;
74.6;1;Wahab Riaz to Renshaw, 1 run good length outside off, punched to deep point;
74.5;4;Wahab Riaz to Renshaw, FOUR runs short and wide, poor delivery. Sliced behind point for four. Easy for a man who has been batting since morning;
74.4;?;Wahab Riaz to Renshaw, no run slow, loopy full toss outside off. Renshaw waits, waits, waits, waits and then mis-times his drive back to the bowler. Wears a big smile. He's not the only one;
74.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Renshaw, no run back of a length outside off, 140 kph. Too close to cut, Renshaw doesn't make contact;

71.1;2b;Yasir Shah to Handscomb, 2 byes missed by everyone. Byes given. Tossed up outside off, Handscomb comes down and misses his drive. The ball spins and Sarfraz can't collect. Younis at slip can't either. Four byes, but a missed stumping;
70.6;?;Md Imran Khan to Renshaw, no run dabbed to gully, 130 kph;
70.5;4;Md Imran Khan to Renshaw, FOUR runs whoa, what was that? Renshaw losing his concentration. Full and straight from Imran. Renshaw sees it early, wants to whip the ball, more of a heave, but the ball takes the outside edge and flies over gully for four;

68.6;1nb;Md Imran Khan to Handscomb, (no ball) goes back and defends but Imran has overstepped. These no-balls are not helping Pakistan. They have to bowl extra, they concede free runs, they stall the momentum. Not good;

Back of a length, gets that to tail back in. Renshaw's first instinct was to sway out of the line but realised late that the ball was coming back in.

Imran Khan
 Innings Start
Doesn't look like Australia has enforced the follow-on. Their top four batsmen were charging off the field. Their quicks will get a bit of rest as a result. Not sure I'd have batted again considering the weather. But well, I'm not playing Test cricket for a reason.

85.5;W;Lyon to Amir, OUT gone! Amir hits the ball straight to mid-off. Some flight outside off from Lyon, Amir clears his front leg and chips his wicket away. Was a bit of a nothing shot in the end. Seemed like he wanted to go after the ball when he saw flight, but then thought about bailing out and playing along the ground.

The ball deflects to Handscomb's gloves, which in turn ricochets towards Smith's right at first slip. He dives away and takes a stunning catch one-handed catch. That was full and straight too, so not sure if it was given lbw because umpire Ravi's finger was up rather quickly.

66.1;?;Hazlewood to Younis, no run 138 kph, full and straight, towards off. Played into the leg side;
65.6;W;Lyon to Misbah, OUT oh no. Misbah, what have you done, again? He always wanted to tee off against the spin of Lyon. Flat delivery with a bit of drift, it doesn't stop Misbah. He goes down on one knee and aims for a heave over midwicket, in typical Misbah style. Like he did against Moeen in the England summer, he mis-times one. Hangs in the air for a while.
