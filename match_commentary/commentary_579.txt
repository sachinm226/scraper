So, India have bowled out Australia for 159 in 43.1 overs. Ishant leads his team-mates off the field. A great effort from India, thanks to their seamers, who now need 160 to notch their first win of the CB Series. Only Hussey holding the innings together with an unbeaten 65. We will have an extended break for lunch, I'd say about an hour, but do come back and join Sajan and myself for the second innings.
Plenty of queries as to when Australia were last bowled out inside 50 overs. Well, not long ago, actually - they were dismissed for 193 by India in Mumbai as recently as October 17, 2007. Before that, New Zealand got them for 148 in 49.3 overs on February 16. The last time they failed to bat out 50 overs in Australia was a week before that when, at this very ground, they were bowled out by England for 252 in 48.3 overs. England also dismissed them for 200 in 38.5 overs at the SCG on February 2, so thats four times in 2007. Going back further, they were bowled out for 93 in 34.3 overs by South Africa on March 3, 2006 in Cape Town. Hope that answers the tons of emails coming in. Goodbye for now.
Nope, there's no escape for me. People want to know when India last beat Australia at the MCG. Well it was on January 31, 1986. Now can I get some lunch?
And umm ... by the way ... Australia lost all the above mentioned games.

Hello and a very warm welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the 2007-08 CB Series. Its game four and Australia are taking on India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
This is Jamie Alter, your commentator today, with Sajan Nair on scoring.
But enough about us. Word from the middle is that Australia have won the toss and they will be batting, rather unsurprisingly, given the hard, flat nature of his MCG surface. They've made two changes, with Brad Haddin and Stuart Clark in for James Hopes and Brad Hogg.
India's captain says he would have batted first too. India are unchanged.
There's a steady trickle of fans entering on Sunday morning. I'd expect it to fill up, with a nice, gentle breeze blowing across the G. The pitch looks better than the one used for the Twenty20 game: its drier and harder. Perhaps a bit of turn and some swing in the evening. Batting first was always on.
The weather today is 20?C, mostly cloudy, with 41% humidity. Lets hope it stays good for an entire day's cricket.
Just to jog your memory, Australia are the only side to win a game; the first two games in Brisbane were washed out. India have four points and Sri Lanka two.
Remember, if you're not able to follow the game in front of a computer, you can read every word I type on your cell phones, right here . And don't forget fantasy cricket.
Shall we start? I'm ready. Here come the players and the two umpires, Rudi Koertzen and Simon Taufel. Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden in the middle. Sreesanth will start proceedings for India. Play ball!
 Innings Start
India have beaten the world champions in their back yard.
It pretty much all went India's way after Australia opted to bat first on a hard MCG surface. Their seam bowlers turned in a top display, led by young Ishant Sharma, who came back marvelously from an 18-run over to dent Australia with 4 for 38, his career-best effort in ODIs. He continues to grow in stature with each outing. The others backed him up and dismissed the hosts for 159 in 43.1 overs.
In reply, India lost wickets at regular intervals but ultimately eased home with five wickets and 25 deliveries remaining. Its their first win against Australia at the MCG since January 31, 1986. A satisfying win for them, and they now lead the CB Series points table. They did not get the bonus point (they had to win in 40 overs for that) but they emerged victors in a hard-fought game of cricket. Plenty of confidence gained from this win.
Ishant deservedly receives the Man-of-the-Match award for setting up this win.
Thats all we have for you, folks, and I thank you for tuning in. Do join us for game five, between India and Sri Lanka at Canberra on February 12, (10:00 local, 23:00 GMT). On behalf of all of us at Cricinfo, this is Jamie Alter signing off. Cheers!
