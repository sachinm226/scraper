Data
England finish with 243. You feel that's about 25 short, but those late blows from Tim Bresnan has just given them a little of hope. The pitch is slow and gripping, especially once the new ball(s) wear off. The stand-out feature, though, was Australia's fielding. Some magnificent stuff on show. We can expect Warner and Finch to go really hard early on and trying and get well ahead of the rate. We'll be back for the chase in around 45 minutes at 6.30pm.
49.6;1;Christian to Bresnan, 1 run inches from another boundary...Bresnan lapped a low full toss from outside off, but Coulter-Nile pulled off a terrific dive at short fine leg so it's just a single;

49.4;1;Christian to Bresnan, 1 run gets the yorker in, driven down the ground;
49.3;6;Christian to Bresnan, SIX runs and again! Late boost for England. This time it was shorter and he pulled it, not quite so well time as the previous one but enough brute force to just clear Maxwell at deep midwicket;

48.6;?;Faulkner to Bresnan, no run yorker outside off, he can't get it further than back to the bowler;
48.5;2;Faulkner to Bresnan, 2 runs placed backward of point wide of third man so Bresnan can keep the strike;
48.4;W;Faulkner to Jordan, OUT this time he picks out the fielder...another good catch. Jordan trying to go over the leg side again, gets height but not the distance - needed to fetch it from outside off - and Finch steadied himself at deep square-leg;Chris Jordan c Finch b Faulkner 10 (17m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 83.33;
48.3;4;Faulkner to Jordan, FOUR runs that's a clean blow! Short again, but not quite so short, and this time Jordan connects out of the middle and pulls in front of square;

34.6;?;Maxwell to Bopara, no run Bopara again can't get bat on ball, tries to force a cut to a skiddy ball;

31.6;1;Christian to Morgan, 1 run wide of off now and Morgan punches a single to deep point;

31.4;?;Christian to Morgan, no run Morgan goes back into his crease and bunts to leg, can't justify a single;
31.3;?;Christian to Morgan, no run Morgan defends solidly to the off side, seems cautious about going after Christian at this slow pace;

28.3;W;Coulter-Nile to Ballance, OUT Coulter-Nile makes the breakthrough, and it's a rather poor piece of placement from Ballance. He's got some width and went the cut shot but sliced it upwards and Christian was out at deep point and ran in to take a reasonably comfortable catch;Gary Ballance c Christian b Coulter-Nile 26 (50m 42b 2x4 0x6) SR: 61.9;

25.3;1;Pattinson to Ballance, 1 run fuller and angled across Ballance, who drives uppishly off a thickish edge through cover point;
25.3;1w;Pattinson to Ballance, 1 wide down leg now from Pattinson, just getting his line wrong here;
25.2;4;Pattinson to Ballance, FOUR runs well played by Ballance, gets the width he's been denied for a while and crunches a cut hard over the top of point for a pretty safe boundary;

22.5;?;Doherty to Morgan, no run defended back down the pitch;
22.4;W;Doherty to Stokes, OUT Clarke has taken a stunner at square leg! Holy moly batsman, that is a remarkable catch! Stokes has gone for the sweep and smoked it out of the middle of the bat, Clarke at square leg has had to react instantly and does so, dives to his right and thrusts the right hand low to the ground and the ball sticks - that was tougher than most catches he'd get in the cordon. Super take.;Ben Stokes c Clarke b Doherty 15 (47m 39b 0x4 0x6) SR: 38.46;
22.3;?;Doherty to Stokes, no run Stokes goes back into his crease to defend;

21.4;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run Maxwell has got through the defences of Stokes with one that goes on with the arm, that looked plumb but Stokes is asking for a review of the lbw! And again the bounce has tricked umpire Martinesz - and this commentator - that was sailing a fraction over the top of the stumps. But Stokes got a big stride down the pitch, and that has saved him.;

20.5;4;Doherty to Ballance, FOUR runs and now Ballance does find a way to score, he's got to the pitch of this and driven it over mid-off, a good proper shot that bounces away to the boundary;
20.4;?;Doherty to Ballance, no run driven uppishly and short of mid-off, Ballance just can't find the gaps here;
20.3;?;Doherty to Ballance, no run tossed up from around the wicket and it's fullish, the drive can't beat mid on;
20.2;?;Doherty to Ballance, no run goes the cut but this beats the bat;

14.1;W;Doherty to Bell, 1 run, OUT direct hit! Warner has pulled off a stunning run out. England continue to create their own problems. It was played square through the off side, Bell didn't really hesitate on coming for the second but Warner just swooped too quickly. He had one stump to aim at from side on and was deadly accurate from about half way to the boundary. Bell well short. Brilliant fielding;Ian Bell run out (Warner) 29 (56m 35b 4x4 0x6) SR: 82.85;
13.6;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run drifts into Stokes, strangled appeal for lbw but wasn't particularly close;

9.5;3;Pattinson to Bell, 3 runs this time he gets it over the off stump, advances down on the line of leg stump and slices it over point although the timing was quite there;
9.4;?;Pattinson to Bell, no run gets cramped for room, it was a slightly slower delivery and appeared to grip in the pitch, Bell was early on his shot and it takes an inside edge to the leg side;

9.2;?;Pattinson to Bell, no run tries to work this into space on the off side but picks out cover;

8.4;W;Coulter-Nile to Cook, OUT gone this time! Just went it appeared things had turned for Cook he drives off the back foot to a short of a length delivery and Maxwell dives to his right at cover to hold a good catch. He was right to attack that delivery, just didn't get over he top of the shot.;Alastair Cook c Maxwell b Coulter-Nile 35 (35m 36b 5x4 1x6) SR: 97.22;

8.2;1;Coulter-Nile to Bell, 1 run angled down to third man to bring up England's fifty;
8.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run dropped at short point by Finch. It was hammered off the back foot by Bell, it was a good height but was certainly going at a rate of knots;
7.6;?;Doherty to Cook, no run now he's beaten by one that skids across outside off stump, he was trying to guide it through short third man;
7.5;?;Doherty to Cook, no run fuller on off stump, forward and defends;
7.4;?;Doherty to Cook, no run and what a comeback! Or is it? Given lbw as it beats Cook on the back foot. He's called for a review. Has it pitched outside leg? There's no edge for sure. It's pitched on but missing on height. Cook survives.;
7.3;4;Doherty to Cook, FOUR runs now he pulls a short ball through the same area, Cook quick to spot the error in length and latched on;
7.2;4;Doherty to Cook, FOUR runs beautifully played by Cook, he chips down the pitch then flicks this in the air over midwicket and it's placed wide of the sweeper;

2.4;?;Faulkner to Cook, no run excellent delivery, beats Cook with a shorter delivery outside off and the batsman was walking into his shot;

1.3;?;Pattinson to Cook, no run left alone outside off, 140kph;

The players are on their way...the Australians followed by Alastair Cook and Ian Bell. James Faulkner has the new ball.
2.15pm England know they can make 300 and they will have to do it all over again today. Not sure the top order will play any differently, leaving the onslaught to the likes of Morgan and Buttler. Will be good to see James Pattinson back in action
2.00pm Kirk: "Think Australia missed a trick, would have liked to see Smith in for Bailey and Christian in for Coulter Nile. Haven't seen to much from Coulter Nile yet that suggests he is in it for the long haul. Seems like we are hedging bets with another all rounder."
JV: "Strange from England also. Replace your no 3 and a bowler with two bowlers? Broad's one day batting record is woeful and Tredwell's not much better" Think Root pretty much had to be dropped. An extra main bowling option probably not a bad idea.
1.50pm England have won the toss and will bat...three in a row for Cook. "The other night was tough," he says, "but we have to put that behind us."
James Tredwell and Stuart Broad come into the team at the expense of Joe Root and Boyd Rankin.
"Think this wicket will be nice for the whole 100 overs," Clarke says. Australia have made three changes: Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay and George Bailey are out, replaced by James Pattinson, Xavier Doherty and Dan Christian. That's interesting from Australia. No Mitchell. Bailey is injured.
Ian Healy, on Channel Nine, has said that Ravi Bopara told him England will have a "surprise" at No. 3.
1.45pm Suspect there could be a few team changes today. Both sides have injury concerns in their camps. Steve Smith has been added to Australia's squad as cover for George Bailey.
Dan Brettig and Vithushan Ehantharajah are our men at the ground today and Vish sent this preview.
1.30pm Hello everyone and welcome to coverage of the third ODI from the SCG. It will be a test of stamina for both sides, less than 48 hours after the conclusion of an intense match at the Gabba. And what an extraordinary finish that was thanks to James Faulkner. It will take a massive effort from England to pick themselves up off the floor after that. We'll bring you toss and team news shortly.
 Innings Start
So there you have it, Australia have won this match with ten overs to spare and seven wickets in hand, a comprehensive victory to give them the series with two matches still to play. It's the first time for a long time that a team has followed an Ashes triumph with a victory in the one-day series straight afterwards - England's tour just goes from bad to worse. Shaun Marsh has finished on 71 not out but David Warner really set this chase up with his brisk start.
England's batting caused them problems - they just couldn't get on top of Australia's bowlers at any stage. Xavier Doherty was especially miserly, but so were most of the bowlers.
David Warner is Man of the Match. Alastair Cook says England needed one of their batsmen to go on and make a big score. "It's tough to stop them and we've got two more games to try to stop them."
"I think our bowlers did a fantastic job on a pretty good batting wicket," Michael Clarke says. "The important thing for our bowlers was a bit of cross-seam stuff, take the pace off it. David Warner was outstanding. Certainly deserves a break if the selectors or coach are listening."
So there you have it, Clarke has foreshadowed that Warner may well set out of the next couple of matches. Clarke also says he is likely to sit out of the Perth match now that the series has been won. That would mean George Bailey would captain the side, if he is fit again. Join us for that match on Friday. Until then, from Brydon Coverdale and Andrew McGlashan, goodbye for now.

29.1;2;Jordan to Haddin, 2 runs full at off stump, clipped to the right of mid-on who dives but then parries the ball away from him to allow a second;
28.6;?;Bopara to Marsh, no run he's really getting it to move (he often does) and this one beats Marsh who was prodding at it without much footwork;
28.5;1;Bopara to Haddin, 1 run driven on the up into the off side;
28.4;W;Bopara to Clarke, OUT through him! Bopara had just been starting to find some movement into Clarke, this time the Australian captain left a big gap as he drove and the ball snaked back to hit off stump.;Michael Clarke b Bopara 34 (38m 28b 4x4 0x6) SR: 121.42;

27.1;2;Jordan to Marsh, 2 runs close! Just wide of cover. Marsh drives on the up and it goes wide of a diving Bell as he leaps to his left. Bottom hand came off the bat. Maybe a slower delivery which stopped in the pitch;

22.6;4;Stokes to Clarke, FOUR runs well, this short ball had him in some trouble, skidded onto Clarke has went to pull and it was an unconvincing shot that whistled down to fine leg;
22.5;?;Stokes to Clarke, no run outside off, left alone;
22.4;1;Stokes to Marsh, 1 run worked off the stumps into midwicket;
22.3;1;Stokes to Clarke, 1 run back of a length at off stump, goes for the pull but wasn't quite short enough and it comes off a bottom/inside edge to fine leg;
22.2;?;Stokes to Clarke, no run not quite so full this time, onto the front foot and driven again but this time Stokes can stop it;
22.1;4;Stokes to Clarke, FOUR runs that's a cracking shot from Clarke, leans into a full delivery and drills it straight the ground;
21.6;3;Broad to Clarke, 3 runs low full toss and he drives it between cover and mid-off, but it came from low the bat so didn't quite reach the boundary;

20.1;4;Stokes to Warner, FOUR runs and he's greeted like Broad was, width outside off, full, and driven through cover with disdain;

18.6;1;Tredwell to Warner, 1 run touch quicker and flatter, no surprise there, and tucked into midwicket;
18.5;6;Tredwell to Warner, SIX runs all the way...Warner couldn't resist any longer, he goes down on one knee and slog-sweeps over deep midwicket;
18.4;1;Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run nice touch play this time, opens the face and places it between point and cover;
18.3;2;Tredwell to Marsh, 2 runs down the pitch again, driven through a tightly packed off-side field;
18.2;1;Tredwell to Warner, 1 run tossed up a little more, makes it into a low full toss as he comes down the pitch and it's another run through midwicket;
18.1;1;Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run uses his feet then works through midwicket;

16.3;2;Tredwell to Marsh, 2 runs uses the feet now and clips this through square leg, good sharp running turns this into a two;
16.2;1;Tredwell to Warner, 1 run there's the half-century for Warner, from his 56th delivery, and he does it with an easy enough single, just a punch through cover point off a ball that was a touch too short;
16.1;?;Tredwell to Warner, no run defended from the off-stump line, no real turn there;
15.6;?;Bopara to Marsh, no run is this a catch? No! Oh boy, that was close. Angled across Marsh, who drove hard outside off and it flew low towards backward point, where Morgan dived forward and took the ball pretty cleanly, but it must have been on the half-volley as he wasn't interested in asking the question about a catch. That has only just bounced short.;

14.3;1;Tredwell to Warner, 1 run Warner drives down the ground for the easy single available to long-off;

13.6;?;Bresnan to Marsh, no run play and miss outside off;
13.5;?;Bresnan to Marsh, no run full and wide of off, Marsh drives hard and thinks it's through but Tredwell at mid-off has done super well to dive and cut that off one-handed - that was a boundary otherwise;

13.3;?;Bresnan to Marsh, no run good line on middle and off, Marsh square up a little and pushes it to point;

12.6;?;Tredwell to Marsh, no run Marsh again defends carefully;
12.5;?;Tredwell to Marsh, no run defended away to the off side;
12.4;?;Tredwell to Marsh, no run this one does for Marsh and nearly tickles his edge! It has turned just a fraction, and just enough to trick Marsh, who thought it was the straight one;

11.2;1;Bresnan to Warner, 1 run steered away through point;
11.1;?;Bresnan to Warner, no run lovely delivery from Bresnan as this one pitches on leg and nips away off the seam - moves too far, in fact, as that has beaten Warner's outside edge by quite a way;

9.3;?;Bresnan to Warner, no run shortish outside off now and Warner tries to dab at that, misses the ball though;
9.2;4;Bresnan to Warner, FOUR runs short ball from Bresnan and Warner has nailed this pull, he was very quickly on to that and pulled it up into the air, wide of the man at deep midwicket and it's one bounce over the boundary;

8.6;2;Jordan to Warner, 2 runs fuller and straighter and Warner clips it through mid-on, who fumbles - Tim Bresnan it was - and lets a one become a two;

8.1;?;Jordan to Warner, no run cuts hard and it's collected at point;
7.6;1;Bresnan to Warner, 1 run oh, Warner has nearly joined Finch back in the rooms! He's gone for the pull from a shortish ball but didn't get hold of it, the top edge flies out and lobs just over the head of the midwicket - that wasn't far away at all;

6.6;W;Jordan to Finch, OUT Jordan has struck! The runs were flowing but Finch couldn't stop himself driving hard in the air and there is a man at cover who has no trouble holding this catch.

6.2;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run straight ball, straight punch that is collected by mid-on;
6.1;?;Jordan to Finch, no run there's an lbw shout here and Jordan is pretty interested but the umpire isn't - Finch drove hard at a straight ball. England decide against a review and it's a good call - there was an inside edge there.;

4.4;1;Jordan to Warner, 1 run shorter now and on the leg stump, Warner pulls it around the corner down to fine leg;

4.1;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run better line outside off from Jordan and Finch pushes it away through point;
3.6;1;Broad to Finch, 1 run and back to the pads - Finch clips it through square again;

3.1;1;Broad to Warner, 1 run another very quick single as Warner pushes to off and runs immediately, good judgment;
2.6;1;Jordan to Warner, 1 run too much down leg from Jordan, who just can't quite find his line, and Warner easily works it through square leg;

1.6;?;Broad to Warner, no run defended away to the off side now;
1.5;4;Broad to Warner, FOUR runs super placement from Warner as he gets some width and rocks on to the back foot to crunch this through extra cover, piercing the field and sending it along the ground to the boundary;
1.4;1lb;Broad to Finch, 1 leg bye takes off for a quick leg bye on to the leg side;

0.3;?;Jordan to Warner, no run full and straight, Warner can't beat mid-on;
0.2;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run oh dear, what is going on out there? Warner has nearly been run out without facing a ball. Finch has punched it to cover and called a single, Warner basically gave up on the run about three-quarters down the pitch but the throw missed;
0.1;?;Jordan to Finch, no run can't get bat on the first one, this lobs off the body in front of Finch after he tried to turn it to leg;

Welcome back for the chase, Australia's openers have made their way out on to the SCG and the hosts need 244 to take this series without worrying about the remaining two games. There were some very useful late runs from Tim Bresnan in England's innings - will that be the difference? It's Chris Jordan with the first of the new balls from the Randwick End.
