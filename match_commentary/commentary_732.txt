 Innings Start
Australia win by 112 runs. What a test match, goes on till the last hour of the test match, Boucher played well, good fighting knocks from Boje and Nel, but Australia put on the pressure and got the wickets, wonderful test match. The reason for bowling the slow bowlers in the end was because the light was not good. Australia lead the series 2-0 with one more test to go. Warne is the Man of the match.
