Data
Australia have been kept to 327, a superb effort from England led by their two senior bowlers with Anderson and Broad sharing seven wickets. Remember, Australia were 102 for 0 at lunch yesterday and 243 for 3 at the start today. That's the fewest first innings overs England have bowled away from home since October 2016. Now it's over to their batting. Can they bed in on a sluggish pitch, will Australia get the reverse England found? Back in a few minutes
SRK: "There'll be two key aspects to England's batting: getting through the first spells from Hazlewood, Cummins, Bird, and then how they cope with Lyon and Marsh. Smith won't want his fast men having to bowl long, frequent spells in the brutal afternoon heat."
118.6;W;Anderson to Lyon, OUT full, straight given...Lyon has reviewed but he's also walking off! Does swing quite late. Probably clipping leg stump at worse. Certainly no edge. Umpire's call on hitting leg stump. Taking a decent chunk of it;Nathan Lyon lbw b Anderson 0 (17m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
118.5;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run attempted yorker, slips down the leg side as a swinging full toss;
118.4;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run at off stump, good length, solidly played into the covers;
118.3;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run a little too short, Lyon able to defend on the back foot;
118.2;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run gets across onto off stump and whips a length delivery into midwicket;
118.1;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run back of a length at off stump, defended to cover;
117.6;?;Broad to Hazlewood, no run round the wicket, full outside off, driven to the covers;
117.5;?;Broad to Hazlewood, no run full outside off, driven square towards point where Curran makes a good save;
117.4;?;Broad to Hazlewood, no run length ball at middle and leg, takes the pad and bobbles down by his feet;
117.3;?;Broad to Hazlewood, no run a flash and a miss outside off to a full delivery;
117.2;?;Broad to Hazlewood, no run short of a length, pushed off the back foot;
117.1;?;Broad to Hazlewood, no run over the wicket, full outside off, driven to cover;
116.6;1;Anderson to Hazlewood, 1 run shovelled wide of mid-on so he'll keep the strike;
116.5;?;Anderson to Hazlewood, no run gets forward and drives back to the bowler;
116.4;?;Anderson to Hazlewood, no run beats the edge again with one angled across;
116.3;?;Anderson to Hazlewood, no run short of a length at off stump, pushed into the covers;
116.2;?;Anderson to Hazlewood, no run good length outside off, pushed across, slips past the outside edge as Hazlewood prods at it;
116.1;?;Anderson to Hazlewood, no run a bouncer over middle and off, he ducks;
115.6;?;Broad to Lyon, no run beats the edge, excellent delivery, good length outside off with some nibble away. Top stuff from Broad;
115.5;?;Broad to Lyon, no run touch fuller, pushed up to mid-off;
115.4;?;Broad to Lyon, no run good length at off stump, defended;
115.3;?;Broad to Lyon, no run full outside off, slides off a thickish outside edge towards gully;
115.2;W;Broad to Cummins, OUT edged, taken low down at slip! Nicely done by Broad, pushing full outside off, Cummins goes for the drive, the edge reaches Cook very low. And now the umpires are checking if it's carried. The soft signal is out. Cummins is almost off the ground. Safely into the hands. Well taken by Cook. That will be a quick confirmation by the third umpire.;Pat Cummins c Cook b Broad 4 (30m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22;
115.1;?;Broad to Cummins, no run full at off stump, defended to cover;
114.6;1;Anderson to Cummins, 1 run forward and tapped through third man;
114.5;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run tailing in late, but Cummins is equal to it, waiting for the ball to arrive before committing;
114.4;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run that's a good leave, just outside off. Excellent judgement from one of Australia's batsmen of the series;
114.3;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run attacking the top of off, poked into the covers;
114.2;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run blocked back down the pitch;
114.1;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run good wicket-to-wicket approach, fenced into the covers with a high elbow;
113.6;W;Broad to Bird, OUT big appeal and up goes the finger! Bird is walking immediately, but Cummins has called for the review, and why not, seeing as they've got a spare. No bat involved though, so this is surely dead. Wicket to wicket, recalibrating the line from off to middle, and the tailender had no answer;Jackson Bird lbw b Broad 4 (10m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
113.5;?;Broad to Bird, no run well bowled again, this is tight and probing, just attacking the top of off with a hint of reverse swing to take it away towards the cordon at the last split second;
113.4;1;Broad to Cummins, 1 run on the toes, flicked out to deep midwicket;
113.3;?;Broad to Cummins, no run well bowled, just ghosting past the edge outside off stump;
113.2;2;Broad to Cummins, 2 runs that's a lovely strike, confident and full-faced, through the covers;
113.1;?;Broad to Cummins, no run outside off, left alone;
112.6;?;Anderson to Bird, no run full and threatening. England are feeling it this morning;
112.5;4;Anderson to Bird, FOUR runs edged and through the slips! A hint of reverse as Bird stabs a tentative poke outside off, the ball fizzed wide of Bairstow's outstretched glove but died short of first slip!;
112.4;?;Anderson to Bird, no run outside off, lifting off the deck, no stroke offered;
112.3;?;Anderson to Bird, no run outside off, left alone;
112.2;W;Anderson to Paine, OUT another drag-on! Paine swivels into a pull, and pays the price as the ball stays a touch low, flicks off the toe and cannons into the base of his leg stump! Signs of the wicket's two-paced nature, maybe? But that is Anderson's 520th Test wicket, which puts him clear of the former world record-holder Courtney Walsh;Tim Paine b Anderson 24 (55m 36b 4x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
112.1;?;Anderson to Paine, no run lined up outside off, and left well alone;
111.6;?;Broad to Cummins, no run full and straight, that's a very probing over from an old warrior. He's been below his best on this tour, but he's fought hard in this innings;
111.5;?;Broad to Cummins, no run back of a length, tight line, edged along the ground to the first of those two gullies;
111.4;?;Broad to Cummins, no run beaten again, and that's a beauty. Tight line, nips off the seam, beats the edge and the edge of the off stump. Quality bowling;
111.3;?;Broad to Cummins, no run very full, almost too full, but a hint of shape through the air nonetheless;
111.2;?;Broad to Cummins, no run beaten outside off, comfortably in the end, but there was jag off the seam as Cummins kept his bat inside the line;
111.1;?;Broad to Cummins, no run wide outside off, tempting Cummins first up;
110.6;?;Anderson to Paine, no run short and hauled out to the leg side once again, but a good tumbling stop;
110.5;?;Anderson to Paine, no run forward and defended into the off side;
110.4;?;Anderson to Paine, no run tucked up on middle and leg, worked to midwicket;
110.3;?;Anderson to Paine, no run wider line, punched on the up to point;
110.2;?;Anderson to Paine, no run tighter and fuller. Defended;
110.1;4;Anderson to Paine, FOUR runs that's a violent welcome back to the attack! Short and wide, a bit of a loosener, and pummelled through wide mid-on!;
109.6;W;Broad to Marsh, OUT a big appeal from Broad and England have reviewed! Broad reckons it's plumb, but that's rarely a fair indication. Certainly very full, and if there's no inside edge this is tight... sure enough, it is pad first. Hang tight... and it is out! Hitting the top of off, and that's a credit to the revised line of attack, bringing the stumps into play. Shock horror, it's been England's morning...;Shaun Marsh lbw b Broad 61 (227m 148b 8x4 0x6) SR: 41.21;
109.5;?;Broad to Marsh, no run pushed to the off side;
109.4;?;Broad to Marsh, no run worked into the leg side once again, nothing to work with there;
109.3;?;Broad to Marsh, no run solid line and length on leg stump, met with a full face;
109.2;?;Broad to Marsh, no run on the legs again, cramping for room, over the wicket to the left-hander, which is an angle that Broad didn't use at all yesterday;
109.1;?;Broad to Marsh, no run on leg stump, attempted flick, can't get it away;
108.6;?;Tom Curran to Paine, no run tapped into the covers;
108.5;?;Tom Curran to Paine, no run left alone outside off;
108.4;?;Tom Curran to Paine, no run back of a length on a tighter line, Paine is aggressive in defence, looking for the single;
108.3;4;Tom Curran to Paine, FOUR runs a crashing drive! Leaning into the ball, head following suit, high elbow, clobbered along the ground. Sweetness and light;
108.2;1;Tom Curran to Marsh, 1 run round the wicket, angled into the pads and helped through the leg side with a calm clip;
108.1;1;Tom Curran to Paine, 1 run worked down the ground;
107.6;4;Ali to Marsh, FOUR runs that's sumptuous, a sashay down the pitch and a firm authoritative clip back past the bowler, too straight for mid-on to intercept. Moeen is being milked like one of Luke Skywalker's sea cows;
107.5;?;Ali to Marsh, no run looped onto a good length, Marsh looking to be aggressive;
107.4;1;Ali to Paine, 1 run tossed up outside off stump and tapped through point;
107.3;?;Ali to Paine, no run clipped to leg;
107.2;?;Ali to Paine, no run onto the front foot, pushed back to the bowler as Paine looks to advance;
107.1;4;Ali to Paine, FOUR runs cracked through the covers! Wide and over-pitched from Moeen, and utterly panned with a firm stride and a full swing;
106.6;?;Tom Curran to Marsh, no run slower ball attempted yorker. Emerges as a bamboozling cloud of misdirectedness, sliding past leg stump on the full. Nice thinking though;
106.5;1;Tom Curran to Paine, 1 run forward and tapped to cover;
106.4;?;Tom Curran to Paine, no run a back-of-the-hand slower ball - he's used that well so far in this Test;
106.3;?;Tom Curran to Paine, no run tighter and fuller, left alone;
106.2;?;Tom Curran to Paine, no run short and wide, looking for the drag-on - well, it's worked twice already;
106.1;?;Tom Curran to Paine, no run ploughing a furrow outside off stump;
105.6;?;Ali to Marsh, no run a quicker ball, fizzed into a stout front-foot block;
105.5;?;Ali to Marsh, no run hurried on the back foot, stands tall to defend;
105.4;?;Ali to Marsh, no run advancing down the track, gathered in the followthrough;

104.5;4;Woakes to Paine, FOUR runs over-pitched and punched sweetly along the deck, clean through the covers. Root gets a hand to take some of the pace off the ball, but can't prevent the boundary;
104.4;?;Woakes to Paine, no run back over the wicket, firmly forward to defend back down the line;
104.3;1;Woakes to Marsh, 1 run worked into the leg side;

102.4;?;Woakes to Paine, no run full outside off, just a hint of shape away, left alone;
102.3;?;Woakes to Paine, no run back of a length at off stump, defended to the on side;
102.2;2;Woakes to Paine, 2 runs full and straight, worked behind square on the leg side and they scamper a tight second;
102.1;?;Woakes to Paine, no run short outside off, doesn't work this time as Paine leaves it alone;
101.6;4;Ali to Marsh, FOUR runs that's a very neat shot, touch of with from Moeen, Marsh threads it through the off side wide of point. Lovely timing;

100.6;?;Woakes to Paine, no run good length outside off, left alone;
100.5;W;Woakes to Marsh, OUT another drag on! England have worked out their tactics. Short outside off, Marsh aiming to play square through the off side, gets a bottom edge into the pitch which then bounces into the timber. Slow-pitch dismissals;Mitchell Marsh b Woakes 9 (19m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50;
100.4;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run back of a length outside off, 82mph/132kph, defended;

96.3;?;Tom Curran to Marsh, no run good delivery, back of a length some some shape back in at Marsh who defends from the crease;
96.2;W;Tom Curran to Smith, OUT got him! Dragged on. This time it is his first Test wicket. His foot is okay, they aren't checking for the no-ball. Short outside off, Smith went to force it through the off side and gets a bottom edge into his stumps. For all the planning, short outside off works a treat!;Steven Smith b Curran 76 (211m 156b 8x4 0x6) SR: 48.71;

Mustafa Moudi: "Root has employed 2 bowlers who havent picked a Test Wicket to get a breakthrough and get their maiden wicket" They've all got to start somewhere
 Innings Start
10.40am Players back in the middle, the sun is breaking through. Pete: "So do Australia head out trying to secure the draw? It's not something they're good at applying themselves towards." Well, they earned a hard-fought one in India earlier this year
Tom: "Overcast conditions can change a game in England but mean nothing in Australia with the Kooka ball - not worth mentioning! "
10.37am Pfitzy: "Anderson and Broad will be licking their lips if there is a bit of cloud around. New ball in hand, and I reckon Smith will be batting before drinks to save the game."
Andrew Price: "Good time to remember Gooch carrying his bat against the WI at Headingly in 1991. One of the least appreciate, great innings of all time. A big score, in a low scoring game, against a true fast attack. Criminally under appreciated." Not sure it was under appreciated. Ranked the greatest innings of all time under a lot of metrics!
Cook walked on a few moments ago, and now he walks off to another ovation having carried his bat - the highest ever score to do so. Cummins finishes for four wickets, a good effort after his illness. But, given the overcast conditions, probably not the worst thing for England. Get bowling.
Moose: "You would have to say, Australia's Day by far today. Dominating"

The umpires are conferring to make sure it carried... but the soft signal is out, so let's see ... nope, that has burst through his hands on impact, so Broad will bat on! Or will he? They are taking an age to overturn it, and the upshot is that the TV replay is inconclusive!

110.2;?;Hazlewood to Cook, no run better from Cook, more solidly forward;
110.1;?;Hazlewood to Cook, no run that's a jaffa! The best ball of the session, probably the day! Extra pace from round the wicket, exploding from a good length and Cook is trapped on the crease as the ball bursts past the edge;
