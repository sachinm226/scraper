"Asif Asghar: "can Australia reply as Sri Lanka v India 1997 where India made 537 in first innings and Sri Lanka replied as world record of 952??" Will Warner do a Jayasuriya? Will Maxwell bat at three and do a Mahanama?
4.40pm They've left Australia 12 overs to bat out tonight, I think. Will be an awkward time for Rogers and Warner, who will have to pull off his keeping pads and gloves and quickly readjust his mind to batting. The pitch has looked pretty flat right through Pakistan's innings, but their bowlers may be better suited to the conditions, and they will be bowling with a massive total behind them.

163.1;4;Starc to Sarfaraz, FOUR runs short ball, rises up quite high as Sarfraz puts his hands in front of his face to shield himself. Ball hits the shoulder of the bat and loops over the slips and down to the third man boundary;

 Innings Start
3.30pm Pakistan have a lead of 309. Have they enforced the follow-on? Watch this space. Nope. They haven't. Pakistan will bat again.
67.2;W;Hafeez to Siddle, OUT down the track now and that's such a soft dismissal. Hafeez is among the wickets now. He didn't quite get to the pitch and ended up playing a feeble chip, straight down long-on's throat;Peter Siddle c Yasir Shah b Mohammad Hafeez 28 (63m 45b 3x4 0x6) SR: 62.22;
67.1;?;Hafeez to Siddle, no run tossed up outside off, and he comes forward to defend;
66.6;W;Md Imran Khan to Marsh, OUT and the full-toss has ended his innings! It was angling in towards off stump and he pushed at it with his hands and mid-on simply had to lean to his right to catch that at chest height.

62.2;?;Rahat Ali to Siddle, no run big appeal for lbw, and it's been given! It's quite full, swings in and strikes him on the front pad as he plays around it. Did that pitch in line? Australia have reviewed, let's see... definitely no edge, because his front pad was in the way of his bat... pitched marginally outside leg, Hawkeye says, and the umpire will have to reverse his decision. Initially, it looked like it just about pitched in line. Whew. Good review by Australia.;

58.5;?;Md Imran Khan to Marsh, no run this one goes the other way. Starts on a pretty teasing line and length outside off but Marsh isn't tempted into playing at it;

29.4;W;Babar to Smith, OUT plays back to a length ball and it hurries through, straightens a bit, and hits him on the back pad. Another big appeal, not given, but this time they review. He played across the line, looking to hit it leg side, and it hit the top of the pad flap. He's playing right back, and Hawkeye says it's hitting a major chunk of the top of middle. The umpire has to overturn his decision, and Babar is all over Australia.;Steven Smith lbw b Zulfiqar Babar 0 (7m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

28.2;W;Rahat Ali to Lyon, OUT bowled him! A bit of shape into the right hander, straightened from off stump, and it was the length that got Lyon.

Drinks break.
 Innings Start
Shahzad: "KK give me a quick answer, Can Australia win?" I'm going to sit on the fence and say no.
1.35pm Two batsmen from the same team making twin hundreds in the same Test. Misbah and Azhar become only the second pair, since Ian and Greg Chappell at Wellington in 1974, to achieve the feat. Misbah has equalled Viv Richards with the fastest hundred in Test history, off 56 balls. Pakistan have ground Australia into the dust, and have set them a target of 603. They have all the time in the world to bowl them out again, with 48 overs still left to play today and an entire day tomorrow.
60.4;1;Starc to Azhar Ali, 1 run now Azhar gets to his hundred. Top innings. It's angled in from back of a length and he looks to punch through the off side, gets an inside edge that runs away towards square leg. Gets to the other end, raises both arms, and then does a sajda, kneeling down and placing his forehead against the ground. Pakistan declare, and Misbah and Azhar walk back to a standing ovation from the crowd and their teammates;

52.6;?;Starc to Misbah, no run full, slanting down the leg side. Misbah shuffles across to flick it over midwicket. Doesn't connect, hits his pads, and Starc has a rueful appeal, but that was definitely sliding down leg;
52.5;4b;Starc to Misbah, 4 byes it's a full-toss down the leg side and he misses the flick. Bounces again and Maxwell has no chance of stopping that, diving to his left;
52.4;2;Starc to Misbah, 2 runs shuffles across and he bowls a slower bouncer outside off. He reaches over and prods it away towards the third man boundary;

50.1;4;Starc to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs slanted across outside off and Azhar gets forward, gets his head over the ball and gets down on one knee to drive that through squarish cover. Superb timing;

49.1;?;Siddle to Misbah, no run back of a length, a bit of movement in towards off stump, defended off the back foot;
48.6;3;Starc to Misbah, 3 runs Yes he can. It's on the pads and he clips it away wide of short midwicket and the batsmen run three. This is the fastest fifty in the history of Test cricket. What a statement from Pakistan's captain;
48.5;?;Starc to Misbah, no run length ball angled across, very quick, and Misbah is beaten trying to poke at it away from his body;
48.4;?;Starc to Misbah, no run short, and he misses out on the pull. It came on slower than he expected and it hit him on the chest;

48.2;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run length ball outside off, defended to short cover;
48.1;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run short down the leg side. Warner does well to dive to his left and stop it;

46.6;?;Marsh to Misbah, no run a bit of movement in from off stump as Misbah goes back looking to pull. It wasn't short enough for that, and it comes in and smacks him on the thigh;
46.5;4;Marsh to Misbah, FOUR runs full on off stump, and he clears his front leg and punches it hard down the ground. Mid-off dives to his right but he has no chance of stopping that;

46.3;2;Marsh to Misbah, 2 runs too straight now and he whips it off his hips down towards deep midwicket;
46.2;1;Marsh to Azhar Ali, 1 run another drop It's Hughes, the substitute. Azhar chased a wide length ball outside off and sliced it to the left of Hughes at backward point. Wasn't too far from him, and he dropped it near his left shoulder as he dived to his left;

45.6;?;Smith to Misbah, no run drops this shorter, outside off, and Misbah blocks it into the covers;
45.5;6;Smith to Misbah, SIX runs oh, my. This one was on middle and leg and he went down on one knee and slog-swept it over deep midwicket, into the grass banks. Biggest of his sixes so far;
45.4;4;Smith to Misbah, FOUR runs nearly three in a row. Smith keeps tossing them up, and Misbah loves them there. This one he dragged slightly wider and it bounced just short of the rope;
45.3;6;Smith to Misbah, SIX runs tossed up again, and he's hit it pretty much exactly to the same spot. Such a clean six-hitter, he is;
45.2;6;Smith to Misbah, SIX runs tossed up outside off and Misbah accepts the invitation, launching it back over the bowler's head and over the long-off boundary;
45.1;1;Smith to Azhar Ali, 1 run low full-toss on leg stump, swept down to deep backward square leg;

44.1;?;Marsh to Misbah, no run length ball outside off, left alone;
43.6;1;Smith to Misbah, 1 run dropped! Misbah went for the lofted drive over cover, didn't quite time it, sliced up towards the backtracking Siddle at cover, and he failed to cling onto a fairly simple shoulder-high chance;
43.5;4;Smith to Misbah, FOUR runs high full-toss on off stump, and Misbah makes some room, smacks it back over the bowler's head, bounces over the rope;
43.4;W;Smith to Younis, OUT short, keeps low, and Younis doesn't review. He rocked back to pull, it went under his bat and struck him near the knee-roll. Raises his bat to the stands as he walks off, enthusiastic cheers from the small crowd that's gathered today. It was turning away, but Hawkeye reckons it would have clipped off stump. Umpire's call, but umpire said out, so good decision not to review.;Younis Khan lbw b Smith 46 (170m 122b 3x4 0x6) SR: 37.7;

40.6;?;Marsh to Younis, no run full on off stump, driven to mid-off;
40.5;?;Marsh to Younis, no run appeal for caught behind as this straightens outside off. Younis poked at it away from his body, and his feet followed after the ball had gone past. Not given, and it looked like it missed his edge narrowly.;
40.4;?;Marsh to Younis, no run full-toss on off stump, punched down the ground and Marsh sticks a foot out to stop it in his follow-through;
40.3;?;Marsh to Younis, no run full again, outside off, this is like a net session. Driven to mid-off;

38.2;?;Johnson to Younis, no run full on off, blocked into the off side;
38.1;3;Johnson to Azhar Ali, 3 runs back of a length outside off, and that is such a lovely punch. Hopped to get on top of the bounce and placed it in the gap between point and cover;

37.5;1;Smith to Azhar Ali, 1 run tossed up outside off, was that the googly? Yup. He came forward, picked it, and worked it through midwicket;

34.2;2;Johnson to Azhar Ali, 2 runs back of a length, angling in from wide of the crease towards middle stump, and Azhar clips it away wide of the man at short midwicket.

32.3;?;Johnson to Younis, no run a little fuller now, outside off, driven to mid-off;
32.2;?;Johnson to Younis, no run that looked close. Struck on the front pad, was fairly full and Younis didn't seem to get a big stride out. He is batting out of his crease, of course. Given not out, Australia review. It seems to have hit him just in front of off stump, above the knee roll... Hawkeye says Impact is exactly in line with off, but it's only just clipping the leg bail, so it stays with the umpire, and Younis is not out.;

28.5;?;Siddle to Azhar Ali, no run this one straightens just a bit outside off. Azhar leans over it and defends into the covers;

20.3;?;Siddle to Younis, no run length ball outside off. Younis shuffles across and defends, lifting his back leg across towards point in a highly idiosyncratic way.;

16.4;?;Siddle to Younis, no run now he pushes forward to defend and the ball tails in and smacks his front pad. I think it was hitting him outside the line. They review this time, let's see. Big stride across, and that definitely seemed to strike him outside the line. What say Hawkeye? He's also taken his stance outside the crease, so he's a million miles down the pitch.

12.2;1b;Starc to Azhar Ali, 1 bye a little fuller now but it's just as wide and he leaves again. With Warner behind the stumps, that's not a bad run-getting strategy;

10.2;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run length ball angled across and that's a good leave in the end from Azhar. It shaped back in a touch and juuust missed off stump. Actually, he didn';t cover his off stump, and maybe thought it was wider than it actually was;

 Innings Start
1.35pm: Looks like there won't be an interview of Younis, so that brings an end to our coverage of this game. A historic win for Pakistan, some incredible records set over the course of the series, and it's been a pleasure to bring it to you. Hope you enjoyed it. Until next time, it's goodbye from me and Raghav. We'll leave you with a few more comments:
Imran: "I was waiting desperately to see how many "Really" misbah uses in his speech. By the look of it he only used the word twice this time. "
naveed: "In the process, Zulfiqar and Yasir made us forget that Pakistan's great spinner, Saeed Ajmal, was banned from international cricket"
Dabeer Hasan: "@Najam: Plzzz take more showers when New Zealand is Batting during Pak vs NZ series :p"
Misbah: "It's really an honour for me to lead this side, the way everybody played. Every individual performed and I'm really happy about that. I can't describe my feeling. We were working really hard and playing good cricket but not winning, we just ensured that we would keep on doing the basics. It hurt us the way we lost the [ODI] series and we were determined to come back and it's been remarkable for our side. It's really good to have a youngster like [Yasir]. Playing a side like Australia, for the first time, he's got really good temperament, and in the coming future he can really deliver for us. The way Azhar Ali, Ahmed Shehzad and Asad Shafiq have batted, and Sarfraz is really a find. These guys are going to play for the next 7-8 years and we have a side for the future. Everybody is in form [ahead of the New Zealand series], everyone is full of confidence, and after that the World Cup."
Lots of awards for Pakistan's players, including "most colourful innings" to Azhar Ali. The big ones: Misbah-ul-Haq is the man of the match and Younis Khan is the man of the series.
First up, Michael Clarke: "They played outstanding cricket in both Tests and we have been outplayed. Unfortunately, all three facets [failed]. It's been the track record of Australian cricket [in Asia] for a long time, unfortunately."
1.25pm It's time for the presentation.
1.20pm Australia lost their last five wickets for eight runs. And that meant some of you missed the climactic moments:
Najam: "Went away to take a shower and before I returned it was all over. Perhaps the only half hour of play I missed in this match -_-"
Arjmand: "Is it one of those times, when a different Pakistan breaks out? Or a new era, where a new breed is gelling well with their seasoned veterans? Whatever, be the case, it is a much needed performance for all the fans who endured a really bad phase of Pakistan cricket. Very well done Team Pakistan. This is more like the Pakistan, Imran, Javed, Wasim and Others had built..."
Richard: "At the point that Pakistan had scored 507 runs - Australia's total for the entire match - they had only lost 3 wickets."
Hadi: "If nobody realized, Zulfi picked up his second 5 for!" Indeed. I was a bit too caught up in the excitement to notice :)
1.13pm Pakistan win by 356 runs. It's their biggest win over any team by a runs margin. There was never really any doubt they would wrap it up. Smith and Marsh batted well in the morning but there was just too much time left in the match for them to be able to pull off the draw. Once Pakistan got through to the lower order, their spinners just ran through them. Clever captaincy from Misbah to keep them on in tandem with the second new ball. They really made that extra grip and zip count.
88.3;W;Babar to Lyon, OUT lbw appeal, becomes a bat-pad appeal as it pops to silly point, and it's been given out caught. It seemed to slide on with the angle as he pressed forward to defend, and that looked like pad onto bat and Azhar takes it after a bit of a juggle. Lyon doesn't review, and Pakistan have wrapped up the most dominant series victory possible. They are now No. 3 in the Test rankings.;Nathan Lyon c Azhar Ali b Zulfiqar Babar 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
