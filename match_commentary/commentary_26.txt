6.10pm Innings break Brilliant performance from Pandya and Jadeja. Hardik Pandya on the flying mic: "We were expecting to score 260-270 but we always say when you try to score 60-70 you can end up getting 90. We kept our plans pretty simple and aimed for 60-65 and because of the shots we have we were able to get the extra 20-25." He got asked if he would bowl again today, he said "that's not going to happen" with a smile.
It was the third-best 6th wicket partnership for India in ODI cricket .
They have given India something to defend here albeit it is still 40 short of the average first innings score at this ground.
Karthik will be back for the start of the chase with Australia's new opening pair of Aaron Finch and Marnus Labuschagne.
Eric: "After the IPL my mouth was watering at the prospect of Hardik and Jadeja finishing an innings together and they have not disappointed. Seriously impressed with Pandya at number 6, he must bat in the top 5 in the T20Is."
Muzzammil: "How fit are these guys really. Been playing for more than an hour and still comfortable enough to take 8 doubles in last two overs alone. Wow!"

34.3;1;Agar to Hardik, 1 run back of a length on off stump, gets across to work it square on the leg side;

33.5;?;Hazlewood to Hardik, no run ooh, a yorker out of the blue. Not sure Pandya expected it, and he seemed late on his attempted defensive jab. The ball sneaks under and doesn't miss off stump by much;
33.4;?;Hazlewood to Hardik, no run shortish, close to off stump. Relentless with that line and length. Gets on his toes to ride the bounce and defend with soft hands, drops the ball close to his feet;

31.6;W;Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT ooh, Australia have reviewed for a caught-behind! Back of a length, straightening just a touch in the corridor. Kohli is looking initially to work this with the angle, I think, and then he's adjusting to the movement when the ball zips past his outside edge. Or has it kissed his edge? There's the tiniest of spikes on Ultra-Edge, but it's enough of a spike to reverse the on-field decision and send Kohli back. What a massive strike from Hazlewood!;Virat Kohli c ?Carey b Hazlewood 63 (78b 5x4 0x6) SR: 80.76;;
31.5;?;Hazlewood to Kohli, no run edged. Looks to step out and Hazlewood responds by bowling slightly shorter and wider. Knuckleball too. Looks to punch it away through the covers and ends up top-edging it, but it bounces well short of reaching the keeper;

28.3;1;Zampa to Kohli, 1 run a bit of flight outside off, stretches out and pushes into the cover point region;
28.2;4;Zampa to Kohli, FOUR runs Finally, a boundary. Short, just a touch of width, and Kohli goes deep and cuts it away to beat backward point to his right. First one since the 20th over;
28.1;?;Zampa to Kohli, no run length ball outside off, dabbed to short third man;
27.6;?;Agar to Hardik, no run flat, leg-stumpish, clipped to backward square leg;
27.5;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run tossed up on middle stump, and Kohli brings up his 60th ODI fifty with a drive to long-off. He's barely reacted to the landmark, and you can see why, with India in the situation they're in;

25.4;?;Agar to Hardik, no run back of a length on the stumps, defended to straight midwicket;
25.3;W;Agar to Rahul, OUT gone, that's not a good shot at all. It's quite full, it's on the stumps, and it's hugely risky to try and sweep those balls. This one passes under his bat, and he's been given out lbw. He's reviewed... Only bounce can save him, I think. No bat on it. Big stride forward, so that might help. Nope. It's hitting the top part of middle stump, so he'll have to be on his way. India lose a review too. Really poor choice of shot, I think;KL Rahul lbw b Agar 5 (11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 45.45;;

24.2;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run a bit of flight and he skips out, driven straight to short extra-cover;
24.1;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run nice length close to off stump, may have been the wrong'un. Good stride out to defend into the off side;

22.4;W;Zampa to Iyer, OUT gone! Iyer was looking to force the pace there, trying to reverse some of the momentum Australia have built with these quiet overs. Full and quickish, on the stumps, and Iyer looks to make room to drive through - or maybe over - the covers. Ends up a little more leg-side of the ball than he wants, and the ball turns and he slices it into backward point's hands;Shreyas Iyer c Labuschagne b Zampa 19 (21b 2x4 0x6) SR: 90.47;;

19.1;?;Green to Kohli, no run short, and again the bounce is steep, over Kohli's right shoulder. Beats him for pace on the hook;
19.1;2nb;Green to Iyer, (no ball) 1 run short outside off, rises steeply above shoulder height, and Iyer jumps to ride the bounce and steer to third man;

15.5;1;Agar to Iyer, 1 run full and wide, he square drives powerfully to deep cover-point;
15.4;W;Agar to Gill, OUT Given lbw! Gill takes his time but he finally reviews. Gill tried to sweep a delivery that pitched on off and slid on, it hit the front pad a fair way down and the umpire gave it out. Nothing on hot spot or RTS in terms of bat involved. Ball tracking says hitting in line and hitting the bails! It's umpire's call. Decision stands but India keep their two reviews;Shubman Gill lbw b Agar 33 (39b 3x4 1x6) SR: 84.61;;

 Innings Start
10.46pm Right then, that's all from us from this ODI series. We hope you've enjoyed it as much as we did. The T20Is will begin soon, and there's a whole lot of other cricket going on around the world right now too (I wonder if this would have seemed possible six months ago), so keep tuning into our coverage, and keep sending in your comments. Until next time, goodbye!
Nilay: "This game was really good from the perspective that we have T20 series now; good middle over wickets, great death bowling, Bumrah getting vack in the froove(excellent for the Tests too), and also Pandya Power. The series would be good one to look forward for."
Varun Gande: "The curse of the Jadeja fifty is finally broken: India had previously never won an ODI when Jadeja passed 50."
Pizza: "Unpopular opinion but, the toss needs to be scrapped. In a series where both teams consistently scored 300+, and both teams winning every time they won the toss, it's hard to pinpoint who is the better team. Either that, or we need more matches, like a 5-match ODI series to be able to tell " -- I don't think the toss makes this much of a difference normally, so this feels like one of those anomalous series that crop up from time to time.
Aaron Finch: "We fought really well today, just fell a little short. Obviously great partnership between Hardik and Jadeja, we might have been in a good position if we'd nabbed one of them early. I thought Cameron Green came in and made an impact with ball and bat, and showed he belongs at the international level. Ashton Agar played well too, so it was good to get them in and get some information on them. Makes the 50 overs go a little quicker [with two spinners] and the impact they've had is quite important too. That's been our recipe in T20 for a while now. It's nice when guys in the top order have really good contributions, and then Maxy can come in and do his thing in the back end. I thought Alex Carey, Moises, these guys did well too. Hopefully [Starc] is back for the T20s. Just a niggly thing with the back."
Virat Kohli: "It's particularly pleasing that we were under the pump for the first half of our innings, and second half of Australia's, and we fought back both times. One guy making his debut, Shubman coming back, that brought us some freshness. I think the pitch was much better in terms of helping the bowlers, so obviously the confidence levels go up. We were able to put Australia under pressure because of that fact as well. Playing international cricket for 13-14 years, you should be able to come back like we did. I would have liked to go on for a bit longer, but we had a great partnership between Hardik and Jadeja. It was exactly what the team needed to get that boost, even though we've lost the series. We played with heart and desire, and that's what you need to do in Australia."
Steven Smith, Player of the Series: "The pitch did a bit more with the new ball. Both quicks bowled really well up front from both teams, so probably a little bit different to the SCG. Hopefully a day off [tomorrow] and then come over here just before the [first T20I], that would be ideal."
Hardik Pandya is the Player of the Match. "It's fantastic. Been working really hard to make sure I play for my country, so I'm really happy to be playing this series. Natarajan is quite a story, quite an inspiration with the background he's come from. You need to be on your toes to compete against Australia. I feel that you always have that extra edge in you when you play against Australia, you want to face up to that challenge."
"I'm fine if Jadeja keeps that role," he adds, when Shane Warne asks him if he's taken away the Rockstar mantle. "I'm a father now."
Dhaval Shah: "Now that we have won this match, I would like to still point out a major setback we have in our batting line-up and batting approach. I feel we need players like Pant and Pandya to match the approach by teams like England and Australia. Pandya has proved today as well. But Pant is as important in the batting line-up. He should be developed and groomed and given a longer run."
Arun: "Can we just point out that just a little bit of life in the pitch made the game so more interesting"
Prasanna S: "Not to take any credit away from Australia but the win equation is = number of tosses won and team batting first. Had India won one of the tosses, it could have gone either way, they managed 300+ in all the games."
Prasad: "It's inaccurate and unfair to say Thakur did a Plunkett impression. Not being jingoistic or anything, but more than player be an exponent of something. Cross-seam bowlers should be thought of as a subset, much like the holding midfielder subset." -- Yup, yup. It was just a comment on how effectively he used the weapon.
10.28pm A dead rubber, but they're often really entertaining. Today's game had so much packed into it, and in the end, the most significant bit of the action was an outstanding sixth-wicket partnership between Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja, which hauled India past 300. There was just enough in this pitch to interest the bowlers, contrary to the ground's ODI history, and India made good use of it to put up their most convincing bowling display of the series. Shardul Thakur did his best Liam Plunkett impression with his cross-seam smarts, and Jasprit Bumrah bowled excellently and could have had a lot more wickets on another day. An encouraging debut for T Natarajan as well, despite getting carted around briefly by Glenn Maxwell.
Maxwell could, and possibly should, have won this game for Australia, but he made a significant contribution for the third successive innings, and he's put that horror IPL far, far behind him. I thought Agar and Zampa bowled really well for Australia too.
49.3;W;Bumrah to Zampa, OUT big appeal for lbw, given. Zampa shuffles across and Bumrah bowls it full and straight. He misses the flick, and it looked pretty plumb, given especially how deep he was in his crease, but Zampa has reviewed anyway. No edge on it. Both feet inside the crease, and it's smashing into leg stump, so India have wrapped up a victory that will bring them quite a bit of comfort, after five successive ODI losses, and seven in a row across formats.;Adam Zampa lbw b Bumrah 4 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;
49.2;?;Bumrah to Zampa, no run slower ball, short and wide outside off. Digs into the pitch and turns like an offbreak. Swings too early into the pull, and then the ball turns and rolls down to Rahul;
49.1;1;Bumrah to Hazlewood, 1 run leg-stump yorker, almost. Very low full-toss, and he makes room and stabs it towards backward point;
48.6;1;Thakur to Hazlewood, 1 run length ball outside off, slapped to deep point;
48.5;1;Thakur to Zampa, 1 run low full-toss on leg stump, knuckleball too. Zampa makes room, adjusts for the lack of pace, and jabs it past the bowler, down towards long-off;
48.4;1;Thakur to Hazlewood, 1 run shot. Full again, on leg stump, clears his front leg and swipes it down to long-on;
48.3;2;Thakur to Hazlewood, 2 runs in the blockhole on off stump, makes room and drives to the left of Kohli at deep point;
48.2;1;Thakur to Zampa, 1 run full outside off, carved to deep point;
48.1;?;Thakur to Zampa, no run yorker outside off, and Zampa looks to reverse-ramp and fails to make contact;
47.6;1;Natarajan to Zampa, 1 run full on off stump, clipped to deep square leg;
47.5;1;Natarajan to Hazlewood, 1 run in the blockhole, angling into leg stump. Makes room and squeezes it out to backward point;
47.4;?;Natarajan to Hazlewood, no run bouncer, over middle and off. Looks to make room and ramp it over the keeper, makes no contact;
47.3;1;Natarajan to Zampa, 1 run shortish, slanting across the right-hander. Jabbed into the point region;
47.2;1;Natarajan to Hazlewood, 1 run in the blockhole on off stump, clipped into the midwicket region;
47.1;W;Natarajan to Agar, OUT and he gets the last recognised batsman! Boundaries were needed, and this ball - more or less in the slot, off-stumpish - had to be attacked. Made room to go over cover, but he simply couldn't find the elevation, and the fielder pouches it with both hands in front of his chest;Ashton Agar c Kuldeep Yadav b Natarajan 28 (28b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100;
46.6;W;Thakur to Abbott, OUT slower bouncer, and Thakur has the breakthrough. Third wicket for him. Gets up just around shoulder height, angling in and cramping Abbott for room, and he plays a half-hearted pull, only managing to lob it to the keeper off his glove. India's quicks have really pulled this back in the last three overs;Sean Abbott c ?Rahul b Thakur 4 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 44.44;
46.5;?;Thakur to Abbott, no run leg-stump yorker, misses the flick and prompts an lbw appeal. Probably sliding down leg;
46.4;1;Thakur to Agar, 1 run shortish, slanting away from the left-hander, slashed to third man;
46.3;1;Thakur to Abbott, 1 run slower ball on off stump, clipped to long-on;
46.2;1;Thakur to Agar, 1 run looks for the wide yorker, ends up bowling a wide, reasonably high full-toss. Steered down to third man;
46.1;1;Thakur to Abbott, 1 run slower length ball on off stump, clipped towards deep midwicket;
45.6;2;Natarajan to Agar, 2 runs good ball. Agar looks to make room and carve through the off side. Natarajan's low full-toss doesn't give him the length to work with, and he ends up dragging it down towards long-on. Just four off the over, so an excellent comeback, albeit with Maxwell out of the picture;
45.5;1;Natarajan to Abbott, 1 run full on leg stump, driven to long-on. Natarajan may have got a foot to it to slow it down, after which he slipped and landed awkwardly, almost twisting his right ankle. He's fine, though;
45.4;?;Natarajan to Abbott, no run length ball on off stump. No feet from Abbott, just pushes at it and slices it towards backward point;
45.3;?;Natarajan to Abbott, no run nearly a yorker again, pitches just outside leg, beats the flick and hits him on the pad;
45.2;?;Natarajan to Abbott, no run in the blockhole, clipped straight back to the bowler;
45.1;1;Natarajan to Agar, 1 run low full-toss on off stump, jabbed down the ground to long-off;
44.6;1;Bumrah to Agar, 1 run in the blockhole close to off stump, stabbed into the point region with an open face;
44.5;?;Bumrah to Agar, no run shortish, close to off stump. Hops to ride the bounce and defend it;
44.4;1;Bumrah to Abbott, 1 run fullish on off stump, steps across and clips it to deep backward square leg;
44.3;W;Bumrah to Maxwell, OUT bam, the bails go flying all over the place. That elastic right arm goes beyond the vertical and whangs it full and fast, at the base of the stumps. Maxwell looks to make room and carve it through the covers, working against the angle. He misses, and Bumrah - who's bowled so well with no luck all this while - hits. A crucial, crucial blow;Glenn Maxwell b Bumrah 59 (38b 3x4 4x6) SR: 155.26;;
44.3;1w;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to follow up with the leg-stump yorker, and he misses his mark by inches. Maxwell looked to step across and help it fine, and couldn't put bat to it;
44.3;1w;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide slower bouncer again, over off stump, and Maxwell thinks of playing the ramp to third man, then decides to leave it. It's called wide anyway;
44.2;1;Bumrah to Agar, 1 run short outside off, slapped to deep point;
44.1;1;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run slower bouncer outside off, Maxwell tennis-forehands it down the ground to long-on;
43.6;1;Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run length ball outside off, opens his bat face and steers to deep point;
43.6;1w;Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to go wide and outside Maxwell's hitting arc, slanting it away from him from over the wicket. It's hard to control the line while doing that, and Maxwell shoulders arms as the ball crosses the tramline;
43.5;1;Natarajan to Agar, 1 run goes for the leg-stump yorker now, and Agar makes himself room and drives to long-off;
43.4;4;Natarajan to Agar, FOUR runs shortish outside off, and now Agar joins in the fun. Not bowling to his field, is Natarajan. Cuts it to the left of backward point, and the sweeper is well in front of square, so no way is he getting to that;
43.3;1;Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run goes a bit wider with the yorker, and Maxwell collapses his back knee to get down low and steer it to deep backward point;
43.2;4;Natarajan to Maxwell, FOUR runs low full-toss on off stump, and Maxwell's eased it for four, just a push between mid-off and extra-cover;
43.1;6;Natarajan to Maxwell, SIX runs goes for the yorker, and Maxwell was expecting that, sitting quite deep in his crease on off stump. Simply brings those wrists into play and whips it over the midwicket boundary to bring up another superlative half-century;
42.6;1;Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run full on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket;
42.5;1;Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run tossed up on off stump, clipped to long-on;
42.4;1;Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run fuller and flatter, whipped to long-on;
42.3;6;Kuldeep to Maxwell, SIX runs what. A. Shot. Maxwell hits more reverse-sweeps for six than pretty much everyone else, and this time he had to manufacture even more power given that Kuldeep dangled it up slow, and it also landed a little shorter than you might think is ideal for that shot. No worries, says Maxwell, I'll just whack that into the second tier, in front of square;
42.2;1;Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run tossed up close to off stump, whipped down to long-on;
42.1;2;Kuldeep to Agar, 2 runs shortish outside off, slapped to deep point;
41.6;?;Bumrah to Maxwell, no run slower bouncer over off stump, and Maxwell picked it late. Was looking to hook, initially, then he pulled out and semi-ducked to get himself under it;
41.5;1;Bumrah to Agar, 1 run looks for the yorker, ends up bowling a low full-toss on off stump, clipped towards midwicket, who moves quickly to his right to stop it but lets the ball get away from him slightly;
41.4;?;Bumrah to Agar, no run slower ball, fullish on leg stump. Clipped to midwicket;
41.3;1;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run full-toss, about thigh-high, on the stumps. Steps across and whips it to fine leg;
41.2;?;Bumrah to Maxwell, no run low full-toss close to off stump. Punched back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat. Was probably aiming to go through cover;
41.2;1w;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide big wide down the leg side. Wanted to angle it into his feet and deny him room;
41.1;1;Bumrah to Agar, 1 run on the pads, nudged into the square leg region;
40.6;1;Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run back of a length fairly wide of off stump. Agar doesn't pick the wrong'un. He was shaping to slap it through point, maybe, and ends up playing a hurried flick to long-on;
40.5;1;Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run tossed up on leg stump, Maxwell brings out the reverse-sweep but can't beat deep point;
40.4;?;Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run full on off stump, driven to short cover;

40.1;1;Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run shortish outside off, slapped to deep point;
39.6;4;Natarajan to Maxwell, FOUR runs back of a length outside off, and Maxwell puts it away. Lets it come on and jabs it between backward point and short third man. A difficult field to bowl to against a set batsman;
39.5;1;Natarajan to Agar, 1 run length ball on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket;
39.4;4;Natarajan to Agar, FOUR runs there's the Natarajan yorker. Homing in on Agar's front toe, and he looks to jam down on it and gets the tiniest of inside edges that sends the ball scooting past leg stump for four;
39.3;3;Natarajan to Maxwell, 3 runs fullish, angling into off stump from round the wicket. Opens his bat face and steers it a long way to the left of the cover sweeper. Excellent placement;

37.5;?;Jadeja to Agar, no run full on middle stump, clipped back to the bowler;
37.4;W;Jadeja to Carey, OUT gone, is he? That run wasn't on at all. They've gone up to the third umpire, but you'd think there's no need. Carey looked to sweep one pitching just outside leg, and missed, and the ball rolled into the square leg region. Carey sets off quickly, and he's sent back by Maxwell, but too late to beat the underarm throw to Rahul. Kohli was the fielder sprinting in from midwicket;Alex Carey run out (Kohli/?Rahul) 38 (42b 4x4 0x6) SR: 90.47;

36.3;3;Thakur to Carey, 3 runs back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to the left of deep square leg, where Kuldeep looks up too early and fluffs his pick-up. Has to run back and ensure he doesn't concede a boundary;
36.2;1;Thakur to Maxwell, 1 run length ball on middle stump, shows the full face to push down to long-on;
36.1;1lb;Thakur to Carey, 1 leg bye length ball, looks to work it into the leg side and misses. Aborted lbw appeal because it pitched outside leg;
35.6;?;Jadeja to Maxwell, no run and again, beats him with sharp turn from that wide line. Maxwell goes hard at the attempted flat-bat drive and misses;
35.5;?;Jadeja to Maxwell, no run that's the line. Slower, wide line outside off, makes Maxwell reach out to drive and the ball turns to beat the outside edge;
35.4;6;Jadeja to Maxwell, SIX runs back of a length on off stump, and Maxwell's hit this one out of the park too. Quick feet to get on the back foot with hips open, and even quicker hands to pull it waay over midwicket. It's landed on the stadium roof and rolled off the premises altogether;
35.3;6;Jadeja to Maxwell, SIX runs bang. The open stance allows him easier access to this sort of line. Length ball, angling into middle stump or so, and he gets forward, head over the ball, and absolutely shovels it over the midwicket boundary with super quick hands;
35.2;1;Jadeja to Carey, 1 run length ball on middle stump, brings out the reverse-sweep in front of deep square leg;
35.1;1;Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run nicely played. That's fired in fairly full on middle and leg, and he makes himself room for an inside-out chip to the right of deep cover;
34.6;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run length ball on off stump, defended into the covers;
34.5;4;Bumrah to Carey, FOUR runs short, gets it to climb towards Carey's shoulder, but he's controlled his pull beautifully, swivels and simply helps it to the right of the long leg fielder, ensuring he keeps it down;
34.4;1;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length outside off, punched to deep point;
34.4;1w;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide short, angling down leg. Looks to pull and misses. Wanted to bowl the bouncer at his front shoulder, I guess, and missed his line marginally;

32.5;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run good length zipping in, hits the back thigh guard;

32.3;1;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run 137kph, short ball, only gets up chest high, he takes his eyes of it but pulls to fine leg without trouble;
32.3;1w;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide 138kph angled down leg and it's called wide! They appealed for caught behind. It certainly looked like it came off the thigh guard;
32.2;1;Bumrah to Carey, 1 run 137kph, back of a length wide of off, he gets a thick inside edge that runs past leg stump! A touch fortunate there Carey;
32.1;1;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run 132kph, back of a length on off, he stays leg side and defends to cover-point for a single;

20.5;4;Thakur to Finch, FOUR runs pulled forward of square! Iyer gets there on the rope at full stretch to his left but it rolls off his hand into the rope. Too short from Thakur, chest high and Finch was all over it slapping it forward of square;

16.4;2;Kuldeep to Finch, 2 runs down the track now and the ball lands just short of where he wants it, but he goes through with his big shot anyway. Doesn't middle it, and it lands a few feet short of the rope as long-on sprints to his left;
16.3;4;Kuldeep to Finch, FOUR runs quickish again, and Finch quickly picks the line, which is outside leg, and uses the pace to sweep it firmly to the right of the deep backward square leg fielder;
16.2;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run down the track and he goes too early. Kuldeep spots him and bowls it shorter and quicker. Ends up deliberately padding it away. Was in no danger of hitting the stumps from left-arm over, of course;

15.6;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run sweeps again, but can't beat the man at backward square leg;

14.6;1;Kuldeep to Henriques, 1 run length ball, pitching on off stump and spinning further away. Waits on the back foot, watches it turn, and then punches to long-off. Clearly hanging back and looking to play it off the pitch, is Henriques. Kuldeep will want to find ways to bring him forward;

13.1;?;Thakur to Henriques, no run back of a length close to off stump, stabbed to the left of backward point, where Jadeja makes his customary diving save. Henriques took off for a single and then had to turn around hurriedly and throw himself into the crease. Direct hit may have been interesting. As it happens, he's called for a change of pads. Not sure what's gone wrong with his current pair;
12.6;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run beaten on the flick, not much of an lbw appeal because this was spinning down leg. A bit of flight and dip, and the ball beat the inside edge. Oh, hang on, India have reviewed! Kuldeep has bowled a better length through this over than he did in his first over, and Finch, who's got a big stride forward, simply fails to get to the pitch as he looks to flick. Turns sharply to hit his front pad, and it's turned too sharply. Missing leg stump is the verdict of ball-tracking;
12.5;1;Kuldeep to Henriques, 1 run back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to deep backward square leg;

11.3;4;Thakur to Henriques, FOUR runs angling down leg again, but no shuffle from Henriques. Just clips it away neatly to the fine leg boundary;
11.2;W;Thakur to Smith, OUT got him! No 62-ball hundred today for Smith. Not the most aesthetically pleasing dismissal, but Thakur won't care. Back of a length, angling down leg, and Smith, who's shuffled a long way across as he always does, looks to glance it fine but only manages to tickle it to the keeper. Tons of bowlers have tried getting him out like that, or with a leg gully in place, and they've usually failed;Steven Smith c ?Rahul b Thakur 7 (15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 46.66;

10.3;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run down the track but he can't get to the pitch of this loopy one just outside leg stump. Looks to flick and the ball hits his front pad;
10.2;3;Kuldeep to Smith, 3 runs short, turns down leg, and Smith plays the old Tendulkar paddle sweep (pretty much a straight drive behind the wicket) past the keeper;
10.1;?;Kuldeep to Smith, no run tossed up slow on off stump, skips out and clips with the turn to short midwicket;
9.6;1;Thakur to Smith, 1 run fullish, angling into middle and off. Lets it come and clips to the right of midwicket;
9.5;1;Thakur to Finch, 1 run length ball close to off stump, gets forward for a push to the left of short extra;
9.4;?;Thakur to Finch, no run looks to step out again, and Thakur gets this one to nip back in slightly to beat the flick. Half-hearted appeal, the ball was probably heading down leg;
9.3;?;Thakur to Finch, no run down the track again, Thakur shortens his length slightly and Finch flat-bats to extra-cover;
9.2;?;Thakur to Finch, no run length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler;
9.1;4;Thakur to Finch, FOUR runs go on, just throw your bat at everything. Nothing's going to go to hand anyway. Down the track to a length ball that nips away off the pitch, and he drives with bat far out in front of his body. Thick edge, flies in the air to the right of backward point;
8.6;?;Bumrah to Smith, no run length ball outside off, left alone;
8.5;1;Bumrah to Finch, 1 run what a charmed life Finch is leading. Length ball angling into off stump, and this one bounces out of nowhere. Straightens slightly too. Looks to work it with the angle, and the ball pops up in the air, off the leading edge, but into no-man's land to the right of square leg;
8.4;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers;
8.3;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball, fourth-stump channel. Finch looks to get forward but his weight isn't fully forward as he looks to punch this down the ground. Ends up inside-edging into his pad;
8.2;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run back of a length outside off, jabbed into the point region;
8.1;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run dropped again. This is a much more difficult catch. Fullish, angling into off stump and straightening slightly. Pushes at it with firm hands, and it pops back to Bumrah at around chest height, to his left. Sticks his hand out, but the ball doesn't stick;
