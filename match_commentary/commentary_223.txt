Data
4.22pm South Africa recovered well from 5 for 81 to finish with 242. But I still reckon they are about 100 runs short. Australia's seamers have been sensational on a nice wicket for fast bowling. SA have some good bowlers of their own.
63.4;W;Starc to Steyn, OUT and cleaned im up. Where has that been for the last few overs? Full, straight and clean through. Steyn backs away and misses a superb delivery. May have moved away just a touch or Steyn may have played inside the line. Either way, the middle and leg stumps are hit and South Africa's innings is over.;Dale Steyn b Starc 4 (12m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100;
63.3;?;Starc to Steyn, no run short delivery on middle, 140 kph. Steyn hurriedly gets away from the line.;
63.2;?;Starc to Steyn, no run shortish and wide outside off, rubbish. Steyn misses his cut. Would have got a boundary if got bat on that;
63.1;1;Starc to Rabada, 1 run oh what a shot. Short delivery outside off, Rabada nails his pull to deep square leg. Superb shot;
62.6;1;Hazlewood to Rabada, 1 run full and straight, inside-edged to deep square leg;
62.5;4;Hazlewood to Rabada, FOUR runs four more. Short and wide outside off, Rabada hangs his bat out outside off and gets a thick outside edge which flies to the right of gully. To third man for four;

62.3;?;Hazlewood to Rabada, no run another bouncer, this is good because is surprises Rabada slightly. He is late on the pull and misses;
62.2;?;Hazlewood to Rabada, no run full and straight, solidly behind the line is Rabada;
62.1;?;Hazlewood to Rabada, no run good length outside off, moving away. Rabada goes after it but misses. Good stroke, even though he is beaten. No one at cover;

61.5;1;Starc to Rabada, 1 run another short delivery, aimed at the ribs, pulled awkwardly to deep square leg;
61.4;?;Starc to Rabada, no run just short of gully. Rabada did not have much of a clue about that. Back of a length on middle, Rabada tries to avoid that but can't. Takes the shoulder of the bat and lobs towards gully;
61.3;?;Starc to Rabada, no run short delivery outside off, Rabada leaves;
61.2;?;Starc to Rabada, no run and again. Another bouncer on middle and leg, ducks again;

60.6;W;Hazlewood to de Kock, OUT and gone! De Kock's scintillating innings ends. Short delivery on middle and leg, hustling de Kock for pace who clears his front leg and tries to pull. He is too late on that and can only flat-bat a mis-timed swat into the reverse-cupped hands of midwicket. That is a fine, fine knock from de Kock. Superb resurrection .;Quinton de Kock c Marsh b Hazlewood 84 (146m 101b 11x4 1x6) SR: 83.16;
60.5;4b;Hazlewood to de Kock, 4 byes over the keeper for four. Not a good delivery, way over the head, called wide. De Kock leaves. Nevill leaps but can only parry it away.;

59.6;W;Lyon to Maharaj, OUT and taken! Maharaj gets to the ball and chips his heave to Warner at long-on. Nice loop on off, Maharaj runs down, doesn't quite get to the pitch of the ball and hits it in the air with the spin. Warner steadies himself and takes a good reverse-cupped catch a few feet inside the boundary;Keshav Maharaj c Warner b Lyon 16 (33m 19b 1x4 1x6) SR: 84.21;
59.5;1;Lyon to de Kock, 1 run tossed up outside off, de Kock gets forward and square drives towards deep point. Khawaja prevent s the second by hurrying to the ball, picking up and returning a decent throw. Good fielding;

57.4;?;Lyon to de Kock, no run full on off and middle, defended. Superb innings this from QdK;

56.5;?;Starc to Maharaj, no run full on off, defended nicely;
56.4;6;Starc to Maharaj, SIX runs what was that? Cross-batted sweep-heave to long-on for six. Fullish delivery outside off, Maharaj may have been anticipating a short ball and been in position. He didn't adjust his shot and went through with it, somehow it goes to long-on. Somehow it goes for six.;
56.3;?;Starc to Maharaj, no run full and wide outside off, 143 kph. Left alone by Maharaj;
56.2;1;Starc to de Kock, 1 run down the leg and de Kock nails his sweep/pull to fine leg. Very quick on the cross-bat shot;
56.2;1w;Starc to de Kock, 1 wide a very high bouncer and a wide called. No way de Kock could have got bat on that;
56.1;4;Starc to de Kock, FOUR runs shot. Overly full on leg, de Kock drills his drive back to Starc who sticks his left hand out, he doesn't get a hand on it. Beats him and goes for four to mid-on.;
55.6;2;Hazlewood to Maharaj, 2 runs nicely played. Good length delivery outside off, Maharaj gets back and pushes the ball through cover for a couple. Good, attacking cricket from SA;
55.5;1;Hazlewood to de Kock, 1 run good length on off, de Kock works the ball towards square leg for one;
55.4;?;Hazlewood to de Kock, no run full length on off, de Kock chooses to pull a delivery that is nowhere near short enough to pull. No, says umpire Dar. Too high especially on this pitch. Smith chooses to review. De Kock misses his swat, and is struck on the thigh, maybe outside the line too. Umpire's call on impact, missing the stumps altogether. Easy decision, poor review.;

54.4;3;Starc to Maharaj, 3 runs times it this time, driven through cover for three. Nicely played;
54.3;?;Starc to Maharaj, no run out with a direct hit. Terrible call from Maharah. Full outside off, Maharaj pushes towards cover. Lyon runs in from point and picks up cleanly. By this time, Maharaj has called de Kock down and sent him back. Lyon misses the stumps at the non-strikers end;

52.3;W;Starc to Philander, OUT poor shot. Back of a length outside off, Philander stays in his crease and looks to pull through midwicket but he has to drag it from well outside off. He can't. Gets a thick inside edge which rattles the stumps. Poor shot selection. That will be tea too;Vernon Philander b Starc 10 (34m 32b 1x4 0x6) SR: 31.25;
52.2;1;Starc to de Kock, 1 run another bouncer on off, pulled down to fine leg. Wanted to pull that for six. Easy in the Highveld, not so much against Starc at the WACA;
52.1;?;Starc to de Kock, no run short delivery on off, de Kock ducks;
51.6;?;Lyon to Philander, no run whoa, almost gets the run-out. Absolutely no need for that now. Tossed up on leg, worked to short fine leg. De Kock wants one, Philander comes down, they both decline. De Kock dives full length but the throw to the non-strikers end is inaccurate. Warner the fielder, out with a direct hit;

50.3;?;Starc to de Kock, no run lovely bouncer, 143 kph, on off. De Kock sways out of the line. Excellent restraint. A side de Kock has to show if he wants to cement a Test spot;
50.2;?;Starc to de Kock, no run is there some glove? No, says umpire Llong. Steven Smith opts to review. A leg side-ish delivery, de Kock misses his flick, but does he gets some bat on that? Definitely hits the thigh on the way to the keeper. Nothing on Hotspot, nothing on Snicko. That is a good call from the umpire;
50.1;?;Starc to de Kock, no run short delivery outside off, de Kock wants to just guide that over s;lips but bails out because a fly slip is in place;

49.1;?;Lyon to Philander, no run tossed up on off, drift. Plenty of it. Pushed back;

48.3;1;Starc to Philander, 1 run full and straight, worked towards backward square leg for a run.;

47.6;1;Lyon to Philander, 1 run gets some drift on that one, flight outside off, a thick outside edge skews down towards third man.;
47.5;?;Lyon to Philander, no run flat outside off, Philander stays back and pushes this back;

47.1;?;Lyon to Philander, no run worked to midwicket;
46.6;?;Starc to de Kock, no run hits him on the helmet grille. Excellent over from Starc, all aggression. Pitches this shorter, more zip from this WACA pitch. De Kock takes his eyes off the ball and is struck on the neck/below part of his helmet. Starc has a word with de Kock;
46.5;?;Starc to de Kock, no run bouncer outside off, 144 kph. De Kock sways out of the line;
46.4;?;Starc to de Kock, no run troubles him again. Another one aimed at the ribs, awkwardly fended away;

43.5;1;Lyon to Philander, 1 run tossed up on middle and leg, pushed to a deep mid-on;
43.4;W;Lyon to Bavuma, OUT taken! What a catch from Marsh at short leg. Lyon changes his length up, goes flat and short on leg. Bavuma goes back in his crease, looking to turn the ball to fine leg, but the ball takes the inside edge onto the pad. Lobs up but is wide of Marsh. He dives to his right, gets low and plucks it out inches off the ground. Superb reflexes, he was standing slightly deeper than usual, which may have given him a fraction of a second longer;Temba Bavuma c SE Marsh b Lyon 51 (137m 86b 7x4 0x6) SR: 59.3;
43.3;?;Lyon to Bavuma, no run runs down again, meets the ball as it pitches and drives back;

42.5;?;Siddle to Bavuma, no run good length just outside off, Bavuma leaves;

42.3;1;Siddle to Bavuma, 1 run ooh, not worth the run to Warner. Full outside off, Bavuma drives to mid-off and sets off. Makes it with a full-length dive. Would have been safe even with a direct hit;

41.5;?;Marsh to de Kock, no run good length outside off, a skewed punch to gully;

40.1;?;Hazlewood to de Kock, no run full outside off, driven to cover. On the bounce;
39.6;4;Marsh to Bavuma, FOUR runs oh lovely shot, back of a length on middle. Sits up for Bavuma who swats the ball over midwicket with a flat-batted pull of disdain. Capitalising on his hardwork, exceptional batting;
39.5;?;Marsh to Bavuma, no run full and straight, squirted to cover;
39.4;4;Marsh to Bavuma, FOUR runs finds the gap this time. Races away for four. A tad too full outside off, slapped away beautifully through cover. Let the ball come onto the bat;

Faf sees an opportunity to score some runs, tries to forehand a slap through cover but gets a thick outside edge. Flies away to Voges; right at first slip, who gets both his hands on a shoulder-height catch. That could have easily burst through, exceptional catch.;Faf du Plessis c Voges b Starc 37 (90m 74b 5x4 0x6) SR: 50;

19.2;?;Siddle to du Plessis, no run good length outside off, solidly pushed to cover;
19.1;?;Siddle to du Plessis, no run oh. Unplayable. Good length on off, Faf can do nothing but play the line. The ball deviates away sharply and beats the bat. May have hit a crack or was a legcutter. Either way, Faf couldn't do a thing;

Ben: "The benefit of the doubt doesn't go to the batsman, it goes to the status quo. There is nothing in the rules about benefit of the doubt, it is all down to the umpire's decision. If the umpire says out or not out, that decision carries weight until decisively overturned and vice versa. Benefit of the doubt to the batsman is something invented by commentators." What did I do?
 Innings Start
2.48pm Who'd have thought? After Steyn went off, Philander, Rabada and Maharaj worked in tandem, almost as if the injury lifted them to perform better, to bowl Australia out for 244. 139 for 10 today. Just a two-run deficit for SA then.
70.2;W;Philander to Lyon, OUT edged and gone! Australia are all out. Good length outside off, the ball moves away late and takes the outside edge. Carries low to third slip's left to finish off Australia's innings. Hung his bat out and the away swing took the outside edge.;Nathan Lyon c Elgar b Philander 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
70.2;1nb;Philander to Lyon, (no ball) full outside off, gets his front foot to the pith slightly late. Philander oversteps;
70.1;W;Philander to Hazlewood, OUT good length outside off, Hazlewwod stays back, lets the ball come onto him and then guides the ball to gully. Philander strikes again. Hazlewood exposed all his stumps, but the ball was slightly wide, he gave himself some room, played away from the body and provided Duminy a chance for some practice. Reverse-cupped catch in front of his neck;Josh Hazlewood c Duminy b Philander 4 (9m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80;
69.6;1;Maharaj to Hazlewood, 1 run what kind of a shot was that? Tossed up on off, Hazlewood just lobs the ball into the off side, chips it over mid-off. May have wanted to go over mid-on but did not put anything into it. A couple anyway;
69.5;1;Maharaj to Siddle, 1 run shortish on middle and leg, punched to mid-on for a quick single. The scores are now level;
69.4;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run tossed up on leg, Siddle runs down and jams a drive into his boot;
69.3;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run tossed up on off, pushed out into the off side;
69.2;3;Maharaj to Hazlewood, 3 runs a tad wide and cut down to backward point. Philander tracks it down and prevents four. Good chase;
69.1;?;Maharaj to Hazlewood, no run flat delivery outside off, pushed back to the bowler;
68.6;?;Rabada to Siddle, no run nice end. Full and swinging back in at 141 kph, pushed to mid-on with the angle;
68.5;?;Rabada to Siddle, no run 143 kph, good length outside off, played out into the off side;
68.4;2;Rabada to Siddle, 2 runs full outside off, pushed towards cover for a couple. Good batting from Siddle, reduced the deficit to hardly anything now;
68.3;4;Rabada to Siddle, FOUR runs short delivery on middle and leg. No square leg in place so Siddle pulls effectively through that region. Doesn't bother keeping it down;
68.2;?;Rabada to Siddle, no run good length outside off, 140 kph. Played into the off side with an angled bat;
68.1;?;Rabada to Siddle, no run full on off and middle, worked to mid-on;
67.6;?;Maharaj to Hazlewood, no run short and wide to start, Hazlewood scythes his cut to point;
67.5;W;Maharaj to Nevill, OUT caught at slip! Great work from Amla, to realise the inside edge onto pad was coming right at him. Nevill came down the track again, but the length wasn't quite right. He realises he has to defend, but the WACA lends the ball a little more bounce, ricochets off the pad to first slip's right. Amla moves sharply, dives and takes it with both hands. Did he nick it though? Australia don't have any reviews left. Looks like bat hit pad, not ball. Blame Shaun Marsh for his terrible review.;Peter Nevill c Amla b Maharaj 23 (66m 53b 2x4 1x6) SR: 43.39;
67.4;?;Maharaj to Nevill, no run fires it down leg again, Nevill tries to glance it away, can't get bat on it;
67.3;?;Maharaj to Nevill, no run nudges it, gently, towards midwicket. Maharaj pulls his length back, worried about behind hit again;
67.2;6;Maharaj to Nevill, SIX runs beautifully done. He comes down the track - without giving the bowler any inkling of it - turns a length ball on leg stump into a half-volley and launches it over long-on.;
67.1;?;Maharaj to Nevill, no run goes back to block a good length ball on off stump;
66.6;?;Rabada to Siddle, no run back of a length and outside off, defends into the covers;
66.5;?;Rabada to Siddle, no run banged in short and angled down leg, Siddle has read the length better, or maybe he was still expecting that kind of delivery, ducks;
66.4;?;Rabada to Siddle, no run appeals for a leg before as Siddle attempts to duck into a back of a length ball. He was thinking about the bouncer. He was in no position to meet the ball. Ended up basically taking evasive action. Impact seems seems to be on the arm guard. HotSpot and Snicko confirm it. No bat involved, no glove either. Ball-tracking says it would miss the stumps. Llong's not-out call to be upheld;
66.3;1;Rabada to Nevill, 1 run moves back and across to work a shortish delivery off his hips to deep square leg;
66.2;?;Rabada to Nevill, no run good length on off stump, Nevill defends;
66.1;4;Rabada to Nevill, FOUR runs vacant point region, and that means Nevill can flash hard outside off. It's back of a length, wide for him to throw his hands at. Punchy batting;
65.6;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run drifts in on middle and leg, Siddle defends tentatively, worried by said drift. Inside edge to short leg;
65.5;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run drags him to block a flighted delivery outside off stump;
65.4;4;Maharaj to Siddle, FOUR runs that's better. Stays put in the crease, takes the overpitched ball on off stump and launches it to long-on;
65.3;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run and now he comes down the track, premeditated it. Maharaj pulls his length back. Could only block;
65.2;4;Maharaj to Siddle, FOUR runs so close as he cuts from the stump - when the ball was on a good length and heading towards off stump. Could easily have been bowled, but he's got enough of an outside edge to the third man boundary;
65.1;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run flighted on middle and off stump, defended;
64.6;?;Rabada to Nevill, no run ends the over with a bouncer on middle and leg, Nevill ducks it;
64.5;?;Rabada to Nevill, no run another really full, really wide delivery and this time Nevill avoids it. Good work. He's the best of the rest for Australia now. Has to stick around;
64.4;?;Rabada to Nevill, no run flirts with a teaser wide outside off at 140 kph, lucky not to nick it. Nevill's front foot didn't get forward, or far enough across for the shot. Pace from Rabada;
64.3;3;Rabada to Siddle, 3 runs continues looking for the inswinging yorker, but Siddle is able to whip his toes out of the way, and then whip the ball past the right of mid-on;
64.2;?;Rabada to Siddle, no run 143 kph, pins Siddle on the pads, with an inswinger, but it would have slid past leg stump with the angle. Simply too quick;
64.1;1;Rabada to Nevill, 1 run looks for the yorker, just outside off, Nevill steers it with the open face through point;
63.6;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run tossed up outside off, blocked;
63.5;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run flat down leg, sliding down. Siddle misses the straighter delivery. Big appeal, easy decision for umpire Dar;
63.4;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run jumps down the track, gets to the pitch and drives to mid-on;
63.3;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run flat outside off, skewed towards backward point;
63.2;?;Maharaj to Siddle, no run flat on middle, skids on. Thick inside edge onto the pad;
63.1;1;Maharaj to Nevill, 1 run tossed up, low full toss. Drilled down to long-off for a run;
62.6;1;Rabada to Nevill, 1 run full on middle and leg, 139 kph, a thick inside edge down to fine leg for one;
62.5;?;Rabada to Nevill, no run fullish length on off, a solid block;
62.4;4;Rabada to Nevill, FOUR runs thick outside edge and races away through gully. Well bowled. After using the hard length, he goes full and wide outside off, Nevill drives and a thick outside edge skews into the gap;
62.3;?;Rabada to Nevill, no run a bit leg side-ish and worked to square leg;
62.2;?;Rabada to Nevill, no run good length on off, 141 kph. Nips back in. Nevill is beaten ion the inside edge, lobs towards gully off the thigh pad;
62.1;?;Rabada to Nevill, no run lovely bouncer on middle, Nevill gets underneath that;
61.6;W;Maharaj to Starc, OUT one more. Faf takes an easy enough catch at midwicket. Slowed up on off and middle, not overpitched but full. Draws Starc forward. Even with his massive stride, he can't get to the pitch, looks to drive through the off side with hard hands. The ball skews off the inside half and carries to Faf at short midwicket, who dives low to his left.;Mitchell Starc c du Plessis b Maharaj 0 (2m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
61.5;?;Maharaj to Starc, no run well bowled, slow outside off, Starc strides forward and pushes to cover;
61.4;?;Maharaj to Starc, no run flat down leg, a nothing delivery. Starc goes back and misses his flick. Struck on the pads;
61.3;?;Maharaj to Starc, no run 79 ks, worked with the spin to midwicket;
61.2;?;Maharaj to Starc, no run tossed up outside off, goes on with the arm and beats the bat. Skiddy;
61.1;1;Maharaj to Nevill, 1 run not the greatest throw. Tossed up on off, Nevill comes down and drives to mid-off, looks for one. Starc is on his heels but goes through. A better throw may have had Starc in trouble;
60.6;W;Rabada to Voges, OUT leading edge and Rabada takes the catch. Another one for SA. What a fightback this is. Full delivery on off, brings this one back in with the angle. Voges plonks his front foot forward and is undone by that movement. As a result, he has to get that bat out in front of his pad to make contact with the ball. All he does upon contact is pop a catch back to Rabada, who sets up for a tough catch but takes an easy reverse-cupped catch to his right;Adam Voges c & b Rabada 27 (75m 60b 4x4 0x6) SR: 45;
60.5;?;Rabada to Voges, no run full outside off, 141 kph. Dabbed into the off side, towards point;
60.4;2;Rabada to Voges, 2 runs well played. A back of a length outside off, he opens the face and guides the ball through point for a couple.;

59.5;?;Maharaj to Nevill, no run flat on off, a hint of turn. Voges goes back and defends;
59.4;1;Maharaj to Voges, 1 run flat down leg, worked towards fine leg. Square leg has to run across to cut it off, brings up Australia's 200;
59.3;?;Maharaj to Voges, no run tossed up outside off, driven out to cover;
59.2;?;Maharaj to Voges, no run flatter on middle and leg, defended;
59.1;4;Maharaj to Voges, FOUR runs that will break the streak of dots. Voges runs to the pitch and clips the ball through midwicket, the key was to get to the pitch, did that;
58.6;?;Rabada to Nevill, no run overpitched on off, driven back with a straight bat. Hit back to the bowler;
58.5;?;Rabada to Nevill, no run back of a length, hustling pace from Rabada. Nevill avoids that;

56.4;?;Rabada to Voges, no run 138 kph, good length on off, kept out. Nicely over the bounce;
56.3;4;Rabada to Voges, FOUR runs that will be four. Short and wide, Voges sees an opening and chops his cut to backward point, into the ground and over gully;
56.2;?;Rabada to Voges, no run 137 kph, fullish length outside off, a hint of away movement for Rabada, a good solid block;

52.6;?;Philander to Voges, no run worked to square leg;
52.5;4;Philander to Voges, FOUR runs edged for four. Not a chance, but this is some spell from Philander. A fuller than good length outside off, shapes away after pitching. Draws Voges forward, draws a thick outside edge. Soft hands from Voges. Right of de Kock, front of Amla, in between the two. Goes for four.;

52.3;?;Philander to Voges, no run 131 kph, overpitched outside off, left alone;

50.1;W;Philander to Marsh, OUT Marsh goes and he immediately trudges off. Nothing he can do anyway. Philander strikes. Absolutely plumb. Dead in front. Philander has been nagging away, extracting just enough lateral movement both ways. Pitches this one on or just outside off and gets it to nip back in. Marsh drives with hard hands, the ball goes through the big gap between bat and pad to strike him on the back leg in front of off. No doubt about that one, just reward for Philander;Mitchell Marsh lbw b Philander 0 (17m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

46.5;W;Philander to Marsh, OUT very close and given! Philander strikes. Marsh is out. Thinks of reviewing and does so. A poor review for me. Full delivery on off, gets that to jag back in in typical Philander fashion. Just a bit of nip, a bit of swing and the ball beats Marsh's flick. No bat. All reds on HawkEye. Australia lose all reviews and Marsh. A good innings from Marsh, but a perfect example of how not to use a review, especially if it's your last. That will be lunch too;Shaun Marsh lbw b Philander 63 (206m 148b 7x4 0x6) SR: 42.56;

42.6;1nb;Rabada to Marsh, (no ball) that was very close too, but he oversteps. A full, inswinging delivery on leg. Marsh falls over his front pad, easily sliding down leg. Good call from umpire Llong too, clearly overstepped;

41.3;W;Maharaj to Smith, OUT given! Smith reviews. Umpire Dar has raised the finger. Flat delivery on off and middle, Smith runs down to the pitch and misses his nudge. Strikes him in front of off and middle. He was a long long way down there. No bat. Umpire's call on impact so Smith will have to go. That decision took everyone by surprise. Maharaj's maiden wicket is not a bad one. Clearly not a bad decision if it isn't overturned on DRS. But we rarely ever see those given. Smith was 2.8 metres down the pitch at point of impact;Steven Smith lbw b Maharaj 0 (4m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

Khawaja is very very late on it, the ball goes through his bat which is still on the way down and uproots off stump. Pumps the air in rapturous joy;Usman Khawaja b Rabada 4 (21m 17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.52;

Fuller than a good length, quite the ideal length, on this surface. Warner wanted to just push the ball through the gap at point to get one. Instead, the ball leaves him juuust enough to take the outside edge of his 45-degree angled bat. Taken by Amla at slip to his left in front of his chest.
