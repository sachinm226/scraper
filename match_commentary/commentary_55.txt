Data
5.00pm Rishabh Pant gets a standing ovation as he walks back, for this has been an innings that could mark his coming of age. Lent excellent support to Pujara early on by playing on the bowlers' patience, and once he fell, took over the mantle and batted sensibly with Jadeja. In between, there were the odd flashes of desperation in the 90s, but once he tided over those, it was a knock of pure magic. Jadeja too showcased his much-improved batting with yet another creditable batting display, all of which has all but sealed a series win for India. It appears as if there's no way out for Australia from here. Will they have the resolve to dig in, show some fight and save this game? India will have 10 overs to bowl tonight. Join Hemant on the other side.

166.5;4;Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR runs full toss on the pads, whipped behind square to beat fine leg. 200 of the partnership comes up, he's batting now like he would in his colony against young kids.

166.4;?;Hazlewood to Pant, no run looks to flip his blade and reverse ramp him over the keeper, beaten;
166.3;4;Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR runs pulled imperiously in front of square, no one at deep midwicket and Pant raises his 150. This is the second third highest score for an India keeper, behind Dhoni's 224 Nayan Mongia made 152* in the first-ever Border Gavaskar Test at Kotla in 1996;
166.2;?;Hazlewood to Pant, no run slower length ball outside leg, looks to whip it square but misses. On the bounce to the keeper;
166.1;4;Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR runs sees this in his half and belts this up and over mid-off. Inches close to the 150. This was too full, Pant gave it an almighty whack;

163.6;4;Cummins to Jadeja, FOUR runs takes him on with the pull and connects magnificently. Hit this off the absolute middle. This is ferocious from Jadeja, India bring up 600 and Jadeja moves into the 80s. Right, he can't ask for a better chance than this to score a century, will be his 2nd in Tests;
163.5;4;Cummins to Jadeja, FOUR runs belted back over the bowler's head. Cleared his front leg and just walloped him with a touch of arrogance. He bowled at 136kph, the right speed and tonic for Jadeja to give it a whack;
163.4;4;Cummins to Jadeja, FOUR runs hooks and hits it very, very well. No chance for deep backward square leg. One bounce to the ropes. There are two men back at the pull and Jadeja bisected them;

161.5;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run eased with soft hands into the off side;
161.4;4;Starc to Jadeja, FOUR runs sees this nice and full, friendly pace and Jadeja shows the full face of the bat to lace this back past the bowler, no chance for mid-off. Easy pickings, with all due respect, this is a tired Starc bowling freebies;

160.3;?;Hazlewood to Pant, no run looks to play, then leaves at the last moment as this zips through to Paine;
160.2;?;Hazlewood to Pant, no run big appeal for lbw as he gets this to bend back in a long way from middle. This one kept a touch low as well, but Pant may have got a thin inside edge on this. Let's see. Replays confirm there was no bat, pitched in line so this was plumb . Sadly no reviews left. Okay, so now with Hawkeye, it says the call would've stayed with the umpire as the ball was just clipping the stumps.;
160.1;1lb;Hazlewood to Jadeja, 1 leg bye tickled fine, down to the man at long leg.;

142.5;4lb;Starc to Pant, 4 leg byes slips this down leg and Pant tickles it fine off the pad to beat Paine, no chance for fine leg. These are easy runs, an air of resignation about Australia's body language and it's just allowing India a chance to pile on the runs. Tired delivery from Starc;
142.4;4;Starc to Pant, FOUR runs gorgeous drive on the up! Just a hint of width, pure hand-eye coordination as he leant into it to use the pace and lace this through cover and point.

141.1;?;Labuschagne to Pant, no run slips this down leg, misses as he looks to tickle fine;
140.6;6;Cummins to Jadeja, SIX runs there's short leg, there's short backward square leg, so everything points to a bouncer, but Jadeja is all too smart to know what's coming is a full delivery. Clears his front leg and gives this a proper flat-batted whack that clears long-on. That had a trace of disdain to it.;
140.5;1;Cummins to Pant, 1 run looks to drive, but squirts this off a thick inside edge to short midwicket for a quick single;

138.6;?;Cummins to Jadeja, no run fuller again, Jadeja was once again on the back foot and misses the flick, an appeal for lbw denied. Pitched outside leg I think;

138.4;?;Cummins to Jadeja, no run a bouncer this time, but down the leg side. Jadeja was looking to pull it away but decides against in the end;

137.1;?;Lyon to Pant, no run fuller around off, comes forward and blocks;
136.6;1;Cummins to Pant, 1 run short again and this time Pant goes for the pull, towards square leg for one more;

130.6;4;Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR runs helps along to the fine leg boundary. Wasn't a full blooded pull even though he swiveled nicely, may have been mindful of a top-edge, looks like he bailed out of a hook but still got the desired result. Takes him one short of a third Test fifty;
130.5;?;Hazlewood to Pant, no run full and slanting away, left alone. There was an invitation to drive;

129.6;W;Lyon to Pujara, OUT so he won't get a double century. This is beautiful bowling from Lyon, threw it up, drew him forward, got it to dip and straighten a hint. Pujara was looking to whip this into the leg side but this one didn't spin as much and ended up lobbing back to Lyon, who took a good, low catch.

126.3;4;Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR runs lovely flick of the wrists! Picks this from outside off, pierces the gap inside the ring, no chance for the square leg fielder running around towards deep midwicket. Mid-on gave it chase as well, but he ended up only burning calories;

Labuschagne now
 Innings Start
3.25 pm Mohammed Shami has the new ball. He'll target Usman Khawaja from round the stumps. Two slips in
Alrighty then. Thirty-five overs left in the day. Marcus Harris was seen fiddling with his batting gear even as the two fast bowlers were having fun out in the middle. He's going to come out to the middle soon and perhaps see if he can better his first-innings 79 - which is still Australia's highest score in this series. Usman Khawaja will be his partner. Played a rather poor shot in the first innings - or suckered into one by Kuldeep's dip. It will be a challenge again. Australia still trail by 322 runs and India can't be any more upbeat. Not once Virat Kohli goes through his pep talk.
Avi: "I will be proud to say my kids...I was watched Australia follow on in Australia by Indian team Kudos to our bowlers that to after 28 years!!!!"
3.15pm Took around an hour and a half for India to wrap up the last four wickets after weather allowed play on day four. Australia are still trailing by 322 and India have enforced the follow-on. This is the first time since 1988 Australia have been asked to follow-on at home. Thanks to Al for that nugget, who is back to take over the commentary duties.
104.5;W;Kuldeep to Hazlewood, OUT that's five-for for Kuldeep, done with the wrong'un. Length ball, pitching just outside off and spinning back to beat the forward defence, rapped on the pad and up goes the finger. Hazlewood decides to review it. Impact is in the line, no bat involved.

90.5;W;Kuldeep to Lyon, OUT traps him! It's a full toss. Lyon plays all around it. The sweep shot doesn't connect and Lyon knows he's plumb. This is the orthodox legbreak.

Yes, says Ian Gould.;Nathan Lyon lbw b Kuldeep Yadav 0 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

89.4;W;Bumrah to Handscomb, OUT drags it on! Handscomb swipes at the air. Bumrah screams with joy. Australia fading away. This is that nagging line, on and around the off stump, trapping the batsman in his crease. It might have kept low a touch too. Certainly has him playing a little later than he should have and the inside edge knocks over the stumps. Joint-highest wicket-taker for the series;Peter Handscomb b Bumrah 37 (111b 5x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;

88.4;4;Kuldeep to Handscomb, FOUR runs this is too short and on this slow pitch, Handscomb has all the time he needs to rock back and whip it through midwicket. It does turn, perhaps a little more than he expects, but he's able to adjust because he's watching the ball so closely;
88.3;?;Kuldeep to Handscomb, no run steps out of his crease but Kuldeep makes it dip, and sharply at that. With short leg and leg slip waiting, Handscomb has to be careful to keep it down;
88.2;4;Kuldeep to Handscomb, FOUR runs reads the flight on this early, lunges forward, head over the ball, hands on top of it as he sweeps behind square leg. Solid shot. And that forces India to put a man back to prevent the shot;

87.6;?;Bumrah to Starc, no run short of a length and outside off, no shot;
87.5;?;Bumrah to Starc, no run bouncer, angled into the left-hander, searching for his ribs. Starc ducks out of danger;
87.4;?;Bumrah to Starc, no run goes round the wicket and immediately looks more of a threat. The ball is homing in on the stumps - and Starc's pads - pitched up and menacing. A straight bat comes down just in time;
87.3;2;Bumrah to Starc, 2 runs waits a fraction of a second more on this short ball at his hips and puts it away behind square leg;
87.2;?;Bumrah to Starc, no run falls short of Bumrah as he moves to his left in his followthrough. The back of a length delivery holds up just a touch - enough to secure a bit of leading edge from Starc as he tries to flick the ball off his thighs;
87.1;?;Bumrah to Starc, no run pitches it up outside off, Starc drives to mid-off;
86.6;?;Shami to Handscomb, no run well, there we go. That's normal. The short ball coming up above stump height and being defended with no trouble;
86.5;?;Shami to Handscomb, no run keeps low again! Shami's banging it into the pitch and it's responding to all his wiles. Handscomb is jumping back in his crease, expecting it to come up around his hips, but instead it sneaks down towards his shins. Just about makes contact;

Srinivas : ""All of a sudden Indian bowing looking weak without Ishanth Sharma""
Rohit Sood: "I distinctly remember the 4th Test in the 2003-2004 Series, also played in Sydney. That match was also high scoring and looked like it was set or a draw, but India was flirting with victory on the last day. A couple of lbw decisions, and there would have been a result. True, the run rates were higher then, but anything is still possible here."
Cheteshwar Pujara: "Hopefully after this Test match, I'll sleep well. When I bat, I try to keep my mind blank. Batting for me, is like meditation. If you have thoughts in the middle, you can't concentrate. So when I'm at the non-striker's, I don't think anything. Fortunately I've been able to score big runs in domestic cricket, and whenever you do that, you develop the habit of concentrating. I first started playing cricket at the age of 8. My father, a railway employee, coached me since then. He bowled at me, and he has played first-class cricket at home. But the kind of bowlers I was facing when young, the habit of facing good fast-bowlers takes away your fear. Message to kids: important the way you practice. You can't get out in your nets, and if you make a habit of playing loose shots in the nets, then you'll create bad habits. Like to thank the physio Patrick Farhart, he has spent long evenings with us. When I pulled my hamstring in the first evening, he was always there to treat me. I spoke to my wife and father yesterday, and I FaceTimed my young daughter. Dad congratulated me. Some people were saying I missed a double-hundred, but he said 193 is great. My family was with me when we toured England, but my daughter's sleep cycle was getting affected, so they're home. This is the best pitch to bat on, off all four grounds. There's been a bit of variable bounce, but the pitch hasn't deteriorated much. I wouldn't mind batting again, but hopefully we'll be able to get them out."
12.56pm Thanks, Hemant. Still 14 minutes to go for the second session. While we wait, have you seen Australia's ODI squad for the games against India? Nathan Lyon is back, but D'Arcy Short is missing, and that has put Australia's selection policies under the microscope.
Aaron Gocs: "Pujara looks like he has done enough for player of the series. Unless Bumrah can take 10 wickets" -- I concur.
