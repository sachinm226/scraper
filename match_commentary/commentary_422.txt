Data

0.1;?;Johnson to Dimuth, no run starts off wide outside off, too wide in fact that Karunaratne decides not to chase that;

Bright and sunny. The players are out. Good toss to win, say Mark Taylor and Bill Lawry. Johnson has the new ball.
GK: "I'm meant to be off to the races now, but I've made my not-so-cricket-loving family hang back so i can see the first ball of the Test. The Boxing Day Test always makes up for those presents your family forget to buy."
10.20: Ten minutes to go..
Shaun: "Which Mitchel Johnson will turn up today? Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde? Sprayer or Terminator?"
Gareth, explains the rotation: "@bj. It's due to the much larger stress which bowling up at 145kph puts on your body. All the breaks downs have been bowlers, so Clarke gets a little more exception."
Matt: "Channel 9 have Peter Siddle on the microphone as the players walk out on the field, discussing how playing at the MCG is a boyhood dream. Walking close behind Siddle is 12th Man Mitchell Starc, bet he's enjoying listening to that conversation... ". Can't be too easy for poor Starc, who's probably itching to go out there and bowl. He was smiling yesterday though.
Toss: Sri Lanka have won the toss and they will bat first.
Just the one change for Sri Lanka. Nuwan Kulasekara misses out as he's injured. Dhammika Prasad takes his place.
For Australia, it was already decided that Bird and Johnson would replace Hilfenhaus and Starc. No place for Usman Khawaja though.
BJ on Australia's puzzling rotation policy: "This Aussie team selection just seems like a massive contradiction to me. They've rotated Starc out (y'know, the same guy who's taken a 6-for and 5-for in the last two tests) in the off chance that he gets injured with the Ashes coming up, and yet given Clarke until this morning to prove his fitness. I realise Clarke is the captain, and one of the best batsmen going around the world at this point in time, but what if he aggravates his injury in this match? Who's gonna look stupid then?"
We've seen some fragile England seam attacks in the past, but this current Australia one, exciting no doubt, is the most fragile I have seen.
Going back in time for a bit about Sri Lanka and the MCG. Massive SL contingent living in Melbourne. This should be a treat for them. The last time Sri Lanka played a Test in Melbourne, this happened. Nevertheless, that controversy and the fall-out didn't deter these guys from calling Melbourne 'home'.
9.45am: It's a very happy Boxing Day to everyone joining us for this Test. The action moves to the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Can't believe it's been 17 years since Sri Lanka last played a Test there, and it's also the first time for the likes of Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara. Well at least they got to experience lesser-known venues like Darwin and Cairns.
The first bit of news is that Michael Clarke is playing. Jackson Bird gets his Baggy Green cap. No doubts about his selection.
Lachlan: "Woken up at 4 AM in the morning here in India. Can't wait for a Sri Lanka fightback, just like Durban 2011."
 Innings Start
11.10am: Fine innings from Johnson. He deserved a century. Lyon played a poor shot but can't blame Bird too much, as it was a good ball that got him.
Paul: "This is the first time Angelo Mathews taking more than 1 wicket in an innings in Test matches. He seems a better bowler in ODIs and T20s but his Test bowling is not up to the mark. If you point out he is injured often, Shane Watson and Freddie Flintoff got injured too but at least they looked capable of taking 3-4 wickets in an innings."
Hamish: "Last time Mitch was stranded in the 90's he came out 2 Tests later and bashed a ton. Let's hope he does this in the next test, definitely deserves another opportunity now! More of an all-rounder than Watto at the moment. Can stay on the park too."
134.4;W;Eranga to Bird, OUT no century for Johnson! He will be stranded on 92, Bird was bowled through the gate, full delivery nipping in slightly and it breached Bird's defenses, hits the middle stump;Jackson Bird b Eranga 0 (15m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

 Innings Start
Presentation: Mitchell Johnson is the Man of the Match: "I was seeing the ball well out there and really enjoying my batting. I just focused on playing each ball on its merits. My bowling is coming together as well and the short ball is going well. The time that I've had out of the game has been really good for me, and now that I'm back playing, I'm just trying to be as consistent as possible."
Mahela: "This is the most disappointing day of the tour for us. Winning the toss and batting first you expect to put a big total on the board, but we lost wickets up front and were behind from day one. We had chances to get back in the game in the field as well and didn't take them."
Unfortunately we cannot get you Clarke's quotes. Of course, we will have videos of the press conferences over the next couple of hours. There's lots yet to read about this match from our team at MCG.
Kasun Anuradha picks his replacements: "Only positive came through this defeat is we could see young men playing the next test. Perera,Chandimal and hopefully Lahiru or Angelo Perera will play."
That's it from us here. Painful Friday morning for Sri Lankan supporters. Hopefully the new year will bring better luck. Thanks for your company. Cheers!
End of match: Australia have been clinical in this Test and hats off to them. Shrugged off the series loss against SA and they are all smiling again. The fast bowler rotation didn't bite them in the back with Johnson taking 6 and nearly scoring a century. Watson made runs too and Bird had an impressive debut. When Johnson's hurting them, he's deadlier than ever.
SL have at least three injured men who may not take part at the SCG. This reminds us of the 1975 World Cup when Jeff Thomson sent five Sri Lankans to hospital. What's worse is that even Sangakkara is injured. Wholesale changes for the next Test.
I think Sri Lanka's best chance of winning is if they can somehow simulate Galle at the SCG - model fort ramparts and ocean noises in the background. Can't think of anything else.
24.2;W;Siddle to Eranga, OUT and it's all over! The injured men won't come out to bat. Australia have claimed the series with one dead rubber to play.

0.3;W;Johnson to Dimuth, 1 run, OUT appeal for a run-out and DM's in trouble! Johnson can't do anything wrong at the moment! Terrible mixup here, Karunaratne had pushed it to the off side and there was confusion in the calling, they take the first run and turn for the second and change their minds, Karunaratne had to hurry back to the crease at the non-striker's end and Warner threw the ball from cover to Johnson who threw himself towards the stumps, ala Jonty;Dimuth Karunaratne run out (Warner/Johnson) 1 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
0.2;?;Johnson to Dimuth, no run leaves the left-hander, slight movement before reaching the keeper;

11.20: The players are coming out. Deficit of 304. The length of this Test will depend on how Sri Lanka fight from here. It's still a bit overcast and the lights are on.
