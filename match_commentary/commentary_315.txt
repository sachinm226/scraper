Data
Super finish from Australia, who at one stage looked like they mightn't make 220. Hughes guided the innings brilliantly with an unbeaten 138. The pitch is a slow one, so this won't be an easy run chase.
Grant: "Perfectly paced innings from Hughes. He's shown a lot of maturity today." Hard to argue with that - though he did have some luck when the ball hit the stumps and didn't dislodge the bails. He wasn't hitting the ball particularly well at the start of his innings, but got everything purring nicely at the end.
Join us in a bit for Sri Lanka's innings. They've been patchy with the bat in this series, so it could be an interesting finish.

46.6;W;Malinga to Maxwell, OUT another slower ball, an full.

43.6;W;Perera to Hussey, OUT Perera has conjured another wicket - a run out this time. Hussey hit that straight into the pitch and took off for a run that simply wasn't there, because the ball had only made it as far as the bowler. Hussey turned to return to his crease, but Perera was on target with the throw and Hussey was miles out. Decent knock there from Hussey.

 Innings Start
This series is shared, but there's more to come from the tour, when the first of two Twenty20s kicks off on the 26th at the SCG. Join us then for more commentary.
Looks like we can't bring the presentation to you today, but thanks for being with us. If I can hazard a guess I'd say Phil Hughes will win the man of the match, and Nuwan Kulasekara is the player of the series, but Hughes has an outside shot of taking that out too. Those would by my two picks anyway.
Dylan: "If you had to blame a period of Sri Lanka inning for the defeat, blame the 10 over block, the 17th to 26th over. 18 runs for 2 wickets in this section stalled their innings and caused unnecessary pressure to build. An extra 25 runs here would have helped."
So Australia have leveled it up. Mahela may feel he chose wrongly at the toss, given how difficult the pitch became for scoring in the second innings. Not the ideal send-off for him as captain, but he has been a terrific leader for Sri Lanka and he's got the team to a better place than he found it.
48.3;W;McKay to Malinga, OUT slower again, and gone. Malinga pokes at that one and it lobs off the bat and into the hands of short third man, who takes a good low catch.;Lasith Malinga c Johnson b McKay 2 (10m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40;

20.4;W;Doherty to Chandimal, OUT timber! Chandimal had no idea about that one. Pitched on off stump and straightened, and the batsman was nowhere near it. Went on to hit middle and off. The situation is quickly getting dire for the visitors.;Dinesh Chandimal b Doherty 6 (21m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 31.57;

17.3;W;Henriques to Dilshan, OUT Henriques strikes! Dislhan edges an innocuous delivery behind, and leaves Sri Lanka in trouble. He hasn't looked himself at all in this innings and has taken 48 balls for 19. Pressure on the young middle order now, and Australia will feel they are on top now, the way the pitch is playing.;Tillakaratne Dilshan c ?Wade b Henriques 19 (79m 48b 0x4 0x6) SR: 39.58;

14.4;?;Doherty to Dilshan, no run fired into off stump, hit to mid off;
14.3;W;Doherty to Thirimanne, OUT poor option from Thirimanne, and Sri Lanka are throwing away a decent start. He came down the pitch and tried to loft that over midwicket, only he hit it too straight and David Hussey at long on ran around to swallow it. It was the result of some good pressure, but he will feel that that shot wasn't called for, so early in his innings;Lahiru Thirimanne c Hussey b Doherty 1 (10m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10;

12.1;W;Doherty to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT that was somewhat out of the blue. Seems to have stuck in the pitch more than Mahela expected.
