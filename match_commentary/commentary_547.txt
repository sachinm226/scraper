Data
On a sluggish track, South Africa paced the innings really well. Early on, the batsman were going a tad early through the shot but slowly they settled down. Kallis and AB, with contrasting approaches, gave the innings momentum. Kallis stayed adjacent to the line and punched through the off side where as AB shuffled to the off and worked through the on side. And then the lower order got into the act to push them to 289. It's expected to do more under lights during the chase. We have to wait and watch. Join us in a short while
Chris: "geeves is a specialist bowler who still went for well over 6 an over.
bracken has proven himself as a state player and the best odi bowler in the world and he was taken for 20 in an over by albie and boucher in blistering form. hopes is a batting all rounder thus, he needs to make some runs when it is hes turn or it will be a bad game. geeves is a good state player at best, dirk nannes is a better bowler at state level and so is clint mckay. geeves wont add to his 2 australian cap."
Sean: "Well I'm following it from NYC, but why is everyone all over Greeves? He wasn't even the most expensive, that honor goes to Hopes. Also, even Bracken, the so called specialist went for almost 6 an over. Give the guy a break!"
Adrian: "Get up in California to watch this?? Why do the selectors keep frustrating the Australian public with a line a players not cut out for internationals. Geeves? add him to the long list from the last 18 months that should be there. Hildtich's time is up.

 Innings Start
The players shake hands with each other and walk off. The crowd slowly start to clear away. Australia got off to a slow start in the chase with their openers Haddin and Clarke suffocated by some tight bowling from Steyn and Parnell. Then the spinners took over on this dry track and Australia lost their way further. Ferguson and Hopes revived the innings in the lower middle-order but they were left with too much to do.
Ponting: It was (too many to chase in the end). de villiers and kallis played well and kept wickets in the hand for the end. That's what we didn't have. We got to lift our games ...
Man of the Match: Kallis: "We felt the wicket was quite slow. We were looking for 250 260 initially but when we give platform to guys like Albie, they can push it futher. The new guys coming in are contributing and it's nice. There is a world cup coming up and there is still lot of cricket left in this body."
Smith: "We have learned to back our spinners and they have stepped up. Today we played the game clinically well. AB and Jacques showed they were prepared to do hard work and played very skilfully,. The wicket was slow throughout; we just wanted to get to the end with wickets in hand. It was a professional evening and very happy for the guys. 2 -1 up now, we would like to be clinical and finish on Monday. I have said to the guys that lets finish the season on a high."
That's it from us. Thanks for logging on. Good bye and good luck.
