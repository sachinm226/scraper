4:38pm Three slips and a gully as Starc prepares to run in at Elgar...
4:28pm South Africa look happy as Kagiso Rabada leads them off the pitch. They would've taken 243 at the start of the day, but is it a bit too much after reducing Australia to 182 for 8? Frustrating, certainly, but they won't have too many complaints. A world-class spell from Vernon Philander kept South Africa in the game all morning, before a world-class spell from Rabada scythed through the visitors' line-up. He took his eighth five-wicket haul in 28 Tests. Some player. Stick around for the response, we should have close to an hour of cricket left. The heavy roller has been used.
71.3;W;Ngidi to Paine, OUT breaches the defence. That's the end of Tim Paine's resistance. Regulation length ball, pitching outside off and headed for the top of off. Paine looks to block on the front foot but he's left the gate open;Tim Paine b Ngidi 36 (99m 68b 5x4 0x6) SR: 52.94;

67.5;4;Ngidi to Paine, FOUR runs swivel-pulled away for four. 135 kph, short down leg. Paine picks the length and the gap behind square. Very vital runs.;

67.3;?;Ngidi to Paine, no run slightly short and Paine picks the length and pulls to deep square leg. Looks to hit that in front of square but not good enough timing.;

67.1;?;Ngidi to Paine, no run back of a length around off, defended back.;

63.5;W;Ngidi to Lyon, OUT that's the one. The ball that swings back in to nip in between bat and pad. Full and straight, swinging back in. Lyon cannot account for that movement, there is a huge gap between bat and pad. The ball ricochets into the stumps via the pad.;Nathan Lyon b Ngidi 17 (27m 20b 4x4 0x6) SR: 85;
63.4;?;Ngidi to Lyon, no run full and straight, pushed to mid-on, 136 kph;

62.1;?;Maharaj to Paine, no run nice and slow, on middle, Paine blocks.;

57.6;?;Rabada to Lyon, no run back of a length outside off, 140 kph, lets the ball go past.;
57.5;W;Rabada to Starc, OUT five-for for Rabada. A word to Starc as he goes past. That's a jaffa of a delivery. On a length on off, Starc's feet are nowhere, but his bat comes down at an awkward angle, looking to flick, the ball moves away, beats the bat and clips the top of off stump!;Mitchell Starc b Rabada 8 (18m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 72.72;
57.4;4;Rabada to Starc, FOUR runs nicely hit. Too full and Starc drives through mid-off. That's the way to play, try and score as many as they can rather than occupy the crease.;
57.3;?;Rabada to Starc, no run a full delivery outside off, 138 kph, too much movement for a No. 9. The ball beats the bat comfortably;

55.3;?;Rabada to Paine, no run good leave from T-Paine. Good length in the fourth-stump channel. Paine lets that one go;

55.1;?;Rabada to Starc, no run a low full toss on off, pushed to mid-on. Was looking for that inswinging yorker, not a bad option.;
54.6;?;Philander to Paine, no run full on middle and leg, the ball moves back in. Another massive appeal, no says the umpire Gaffaney. SSA want the review, and he makes the T-sign for the review. So Faf reviews. Is it clipping leg? Is it missing leg? Just clipping the side of leg stump says HawkEye, so SA don't lose their review.;
54.5;?;Philander to Paine, no run full and straight, defended back.;
54.4;2;Philander to Paine, 2 runs that's better, full and wide outside off, driven away to deep cover for a couple.;

54.1;?;Philander to Paine, no run full outside off, left alone by Paine.;
53.6;W;Rabada to Cummins, OUT edged and gone first ball! Rabada on a hat-trick! Cummins must have been told multiple times in the dressing room to watch for the full, straight one. So he is crouching low, waiting for the ball to come to him but it doesn't. Instead, it pitches, moves away and takes the outside edge. Sensational bowling from KG.;Pat Cummins c ?de Kock b Rabada 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
53.5;W;Rabada to Marsh, OUT inside edge and it's another wicket! De Kock completes a low catch. Rabada is making it happen! Reverse swing on this, hooping in at a length from outside off.

53.4;4;Rabada to Marsh, FOUR runs outside edge as this straightens in the corridor. Length ball and he's on the back foot;
53.3;?;Rabada to Marsh, no run inswinging yorker just outside off. Jams this into the pitch and feels that in the bottom hand;
53.2;W;Rabada to Marsh, OUT Shaun Marsh reviews an lbw now. Rabada brings one in fiercely from around the wicket and he's caught off guard. Looks to flick and misses. He's right in front of middle stump during impact. Only the angle can save him...it won't. That's hitting the top of leg. Umpire's call.;Shaun Marsh lbw b Rabada 24 (76m 52b 4x4 0x6) SR: 46.15;
53.1;4;Rabada to Marsh, FOUR runs full and wide outside off, feet rooted in the crease as he looks to drive away from the body. Hits it aerially but it's wide of cover;

52.5;?;Maharaj to Paine, no run good length on off stump, pushed back to the bowler on the front foot;

52.1;?;Maharaj to Marsh, no run tossed up on middle stump, steps out and flicks to mid-on;
51.6;W;Rabada to Smith, OUT got him! Or has he? Smith reviews. He was struck right in front of the stumps and he appeared to be walking before the umpire gave it out...before deciding to stick around. It's a poor review too, he's plumb in front. Length ball angled in at middle stump. He shuffles and unlike his usual self, misses this on the inside edge. Back leg, right in front of middle stump. Rabada is in his face screaming "yes!" multiple times. Big, big wicket. Has Rabada made contact with Smith there? Looks like their shoulders have bumped, but neither of them were moving deliberately for it;Steven Smith lbw b Rabada 25 (93m 58b 3x4 0x6) SR: 43.1;
51.5;?;Rabada to Smith, no run full outside off, punched to mid-off from the back foot;

51.1;1;Rabada to Smith, 1 run short of a length on leg stump. Dabbed behind square leg off the back foot;
50.6;?;Maharaj to Marsh, no run length outside off, steps out and pads into the off side;
50.5;?;Maharaj to Marsh, no run South Africa have reviewed an lbw decision. Marsh has stepped out and been struck on the pads after looking to flick. It appears he was outside off...it is. That's a quite woeful review. He was beaten in flight and that was hitting the stumps for sure, but he was well down the pitch and well outside the line;
50.4;1;Maharaj to Smith, 1 run Maharaj is excited about this direct hit! It's been sent upstairs. Smith nudges this into the leg side with soft hands and they take a tight run. Square leg swoops down on it and throws quickly. Smith has grounded his bat and just made his ground;

49.5;?;Rabada to Marsh, no run short of a length on off stump, defended off the back foot;
49.4;4;Rabada to Marsh, FOUR runs oh yes. It's time for some aesthetics. Short of a length and pushed across off stump. Marsh shuffles, transfers the weight onto the back foot and kisses it goodbye before sending it on it's way with a square drive on the rise;
49.3;?;Rabada to Marsh, no run length and outside off, left alone;
49.2;?;Rabada to Marsh, no run short of a length, pitching on off stump and it comes in as he leaves, away from the angle;

48.1;?;Maharaj to Marsh, no run good length just outside off, defended on the front foot;
47.6;?;Rabada to Smith, no run short of a length and lifting up into his mid-riff. Unable to tackle this, cops it on the body;

47.4;?;Rabada to Marsh, no run short of a length just outside off, defended off the back foot;
47.3;?;Rabada to Marsh, no run good length on off stump, defended from the crease;

46.1;1;Maharaj to Smith, 1 run short of a length and turning away from off stump. Punched to sweeper cover off the back foot;
45.6;4;Elgar to Marsh, FOUR runs tossed up slowly again and Marsh skips down the pitch to meet it on the full. Whips it to the midwicket boundary;

42.6;4;Ngidi to Smith, FOUR runs whipped to square leg, no fuss. Full ball speared in at off stump. He shuffles, allows it to come on late and picks it from about an inch in front of his back leg. Routine stuff;

41.2;?;Philander to Marsh, no run very tidy, zoning in on off stump. That's how you earn respect of batsmen if you're mid 120s, around off, blocked;

40.6;2;Ngidi to Smith, 2 runs back of a length around off, Smith gets across and shovels the ball into the gap at square leg for two. A manufactured stroke.;

39.6;1;Maharaj to Smith, 1 run too full there for Maharaj, full is fine if it's quicker. Too much time for Smith to get forward and push to long-on.;
39.5;?;Maharaj to Smith, no run slow outside off, Smith gets forward to smother the ball back.;
39.4;1;Maharaj to Marsh, 1 run on the pads, worked away towards de Bruyn at square leg. He lets the ball go through.;
39.3;?;Maharaj to Marsh, no run overpitched outside off, smothered back.;
39.2;?;Maharaj to Marsh, no run flat outside off, 80 kph, goes through, nudged away into the leg side.;
39.1;1;Maharaj to Smith, 1 run that's a poor ball, short and wide, scythed away to deep point for one.;
38.6;?;Ngidi to Marsh, no run a maiden, 131 kph, on a length outside off, left alone by Marsh.;
38.5;?;Ngidi to Marsh, no run good length and wide outside off, 129 kph, another leave;
38.4;?;Ngidi to Marsh, no run dug in, the bouncer down leg, Marsh thinks of pulling, bails out of the stroke late. Good change in length.;
38.3;?;Ngidi to Marsh, no run full and wide, angled away again, another nice leave.;
38.2;?;Ngidi to Marsh, no run back of a length on middle and leg, defended away towards mid-on;
38.1;?;Ngidi to Marsh, no run fantastic bowling, full delivery outside off, the ball holds its line. Marsh lifts his hands to let that one go;
37.6;?;Maharaj to Smith, no run slow outside off, 79 kph, defended;
37.5;2;Maharaj to Smith, 2 runs clipped away again, but bad timing, on the pads, nudged through midwicket. Amla labours after the ball;
37.4;?;Maharaj to Smith, no run better line, full outside off, 83 kph, defended;
37.3;4;Maharaj to Smith, FOUR runs a low full toss on the pads and Smith clips him away through midwicket with ease.;
37.2;?;Maharaj to Smith, no run nice and slow, but too full, defended;
37.1;?;Maharaj to Smith, no run flat around off, slow too. 84 kph, right behind the line is Smith;

36.3;?;Ngidi to Marsh, no run full, angled away, left alone;
36.2;W;Ngidi to Warner, OUT gone through Warner! 132 kph. A fantastic move from Faf. A full delivery on middle and leg, this one does not move. Warner plays for some, goes through his defense, beating him on the inside edge to hit the top of middle and off. A fine knock from Warner, but SA now have an opening.;David Warner b Ngidi 63 (156m 100b 9x4 0x6) SR: 63;
36.1;2;Ngidi to Warner, 2 runs short and wide outside off, slapped away to deep cover for two. That's a poor ball, he has to find his best soon to follow up a top spell from Vern.;
35.6;?;Maharaj to Smith, no run shortish outside off, 87 kph, punched to cover from the back foot.;
35.5;1;Maharaj to Warner, 1 run comes down and shovels a flick to wide long-on. Rabada, as good an athlete as any in this team, stops two.;
35.4;?;Maharaj to Warner, no run very full around middle, 84 kph, smothered;
35.3;?;Maharaj to Warner, no run quick and straight, the leg side line seems to be working to Warner. Defended.;

35.1;?;Maharaj to Warner, no run flat and quick, on middle and leg, pushed back;

34.5;?;Philander to Smith, no run full around off, defended to mid-on;
34.4;?;Philander to Smith, no run a huuuge appeal. A full delivery outside off, it comes back in prodigiously. Smith lets the ball go, it clips the side of the front pad as Smith offers no shot. HawkEye shows the ball is missing off stump.;
34.3;?;Philander to Smith, no run a length delivery around off, Smith tries to work the ball to square leg but the ball moves away, off the leading edge.;
34.2;?;Philander to Smith, no run good length around off, defended away to mid-on;
34.1;?;Philander to Smith, no run full and swinging away, left alone. This is a good strategy, let him leave and then you either stay there or bring it back in, like Dale Steyn to Steven Smith at this ground two years ago.;
33.6;?;Maharaj to Warner, no run strays down leg, worked away to short fine leg. Wondering why Warner isn't interested in sweeping just yet, with fine leg up. A fingerspinner wouldn't get much bounce too, negating the top edge.;
33.5;4;Maharaj to Warner, FOUR runs he's had enough of plodding about against Maharaj. Comes charging down and launches a lofted drive over mid-off. Shot.;
33.4;?;Maharaj to Warner, no run flat around middle and leg, 89 kph, defended back.;
33.3;?;Maharaj to Warner, no run comes charging down and drives to cover;

32.5;?;Philander to Smith, no run full and wide, moving further away, left alone. Not as exuberant a leave this time;
32.4;?;Philander to Smith, no run full outside off, the ball moving away. The Smith swat-leave.;
32.3;3;Philander to Warner, 3 runs 124 kph, back of a length outside off, punched from the back foot towards cover. The tall Ngidi gets down to his right, and half-stops it. Warner comes back for three.;

31.6;?;Maharaj to Smith, no run flat outside off, Smith goes right back and defends;

31.3;?;Maharaj to Warner, no run flat around off, pretty quick too, defended back.;
31.2;?;Maharaj to Warner, no run runs down to the pitch and drives to cover.;

30.6;1;Philander to Warner, 1 run a tad wider outside off, slashed to deep point;
30.5;1;Philander to Smith, 1 run full on off and middle, Smith walks right across, exposing all his stumps. Worked down to fine leg. Some oohs and aahs, settle down, he's in complete control, like he has been for the last 700 days.;
30.4;W;Philander to Khawaja, OUT edged and gone! And again, it's the replica of the previous delivery. Full outside off, he could have let that one go, but Philander is getting some inward movement. So Khawaja has to cover his off stump. He pushes at the ball, hoping the ball would move back. But it does not. The last ball followed the same modus operandi to beat the bat, this ball catches the outside edge. Amazing bowling from the Big Vern.;Usman Khawaja c ?de Kock b Philander 4 (14m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 26.66;
30.3;?;Philander to Khawaja, no run holds its line! On a length outside off, 126 kph. Khawaja is careful of not leaving his off stump vulnerable so he plants his bat in line but the ball does not move. Beaten.;
30.2;?;Philander to Khawaja, no run full and wide outside off, 128 kph, left alone;
30.1;?;Philander to Khawaja, no run extracting a hint of lateral movement! On a length, around middle and leg, clipped to square leg.;
29.6;?;Maharaj to Warner, no run another tidy over, 84 kph, clipped away to midwicket.;
29.5;?;Maharaj to Warner, no run short and drifting down leg, nudged to short fine leg, 80 kph;
29.4;1;Maharaj to Khawaja, 1 run another fine stop from Faf. Overpitched outside off, driven away to Faf's right at mid-off. He has saved six runs since lunch.;

28.5;?;Philander to Warner, no run 128 kph, full outside off, defended into the off side.;
28.4;?;Philander to Warner, no run full around off, 132 kph, no movement there. Warner is behind the line to defend;
28.3;?;Philander to Warner, no run inside-edged into the pad. 127 kph, full and straight, the ball moving back in, thick edge;
28.2;?;Philander to Warner, no run full on middle and leg, 130 kph, nudged away to square leg. They won't want to give him room;
28.1;1lb;Philander to Khawaja, 1 leg bye drifts on the pads, 128 kph, down leg, off the pad to square leg. A leg bye.;

27.4;?;Maharaj to Khawaja, no run dropped! It doesn't stick! Slow outside off, flicked away to short leg. Doesn't even hit the hands, off the body. Markram the man.;

27.2;?;Maharaj to Khawaja, no run flat outside off, slides on, left alone;
27.1;1;Maharaj to Warner, 1 run lovely stop Faf. Overpitched outside off, drilled to cover. Past Amla. Faf runs across from mid-off to his right.;
26.6;?;Philander to Khawaja, no run another tidy end, full outside off. 125 kph, no stroke from Khawaja.;
26.5;?;Philander to Khawaja, no run full outside off, left alone;
26.4;W;Philander to Bancroft, OUT got him! If you sense vulnerability, you bring Vernon back! Bancroft over the last 20 minutes has been chasing deliveries outside off. Resisted thrice this over, but this one is fuller and moving away very late outside off. Draws him in, gets a thick edge and the keeper leaps to his right to take it;Cameron Bancroft c ?de Kock b Philander 38 (117m 91b 6x4 0x6) SR: 41.75;

25.6;1;Maharaj to Bancroft, 1 run full on leg stump, driven to mid-on;
25.5;4;Maharaj to Bancroft, FOUR runs classy. Length on middle stump, steps out to meet it at the pitch and clips it wide of mid-on with the angle;
25.4;?;Maharaj to Bancroft, no run full on leg stump, flicked to midwicket;
25.3;?;Maharaj to Bancroft, no run good length outside off, defended on the front foot;

24.5;4lb;Rabada to Bancroft, 4 leg byes inside edge and onto the back pad as this nips back in from outside off. He's looking to drive on the up. Shout for lbw is turned down as this trickles through the slip cordon after landing in front of Quinton de Kock's dive to the right;
24.4;1;Rabada to Warner, 1 run full on off stump, leans in and punches on the front foot. Mid-off dives to his left to stop this, but can't hold on cleanly. That's fifty for Warner;
24.3;4;Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs overpitched on off stump, lunges forward in a rush and drills this between mid-off and non-striker;
24.2;?;Rabada to Warner, no run beaten as he jabs at this on the front foot. It slants away from the corridor and past the outside edge;
24.1;4;Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs shifts his weight back and hammers this wide of square leg. It's aerial because he's through the shot early. Short ball on off stump and he doesn't swivel too much to hit it;

Akash Singhal: "South Africa don't have a fifth bowler in their team. With Australia having passed the most favorable time for the bowlers without any damage, this could turn out to be a nightmare for South Africa over the next 4-5 sessions."
 Innings Start
11.55am Great to see Starc walk up and shake hands with De Villiers in acknowledgment of that splendid century. This was a session as entertaining as absorbing. Philander held his shape and kept the bowlers at bay early on. Then, Keshav Maharaj provided some T20 style entertainment. Once he fell, AB went into overdrive to play some magnificent strokes - the short-arm jab off Hazlewood for six over deep midwicket - a standout for me. All this means South Africa have managed to open up some breathing space, a 136-run lead that could've easily been no more than 30 or 40 if the lower order collapsed this morning.
Dan Brettig from PE: "So far this series de Villiers has made 197 runs at a strike rate of 71.89 without being dismissed by a bowler."
118.4;W;Starc to de Villiers, 1 run, OUT squirts this into the cover region and chances a second. Smith is superb to run in from deep cover, pick the ball up and fire a direct hit at the bowler's end. Ngidi had no chance. That's the end of that. AB walks off to a huge round of applause, South Africa have a big lead. He walks off unbeaten on 126. What a session of Test cricket we've had. That's lunch on day three;Lungi Ngidi run out (Smith) 5 (15m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 71.42;
118.3;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run short outside of, AB wanted to ramp this over slip but couldn't;
118.2;4;Starc to de Villiers, FOUR runs backs away and carves this into the cover boundary. Sensational. Picked his spot to perfection. Opened up the off side, cleared the frontfoot and whacked it away;
118.1;2;Starc to de Villiers, 2 runs drilled over the bowler's head, Warner comes around and slides in a long-off before firing a throw. AB was willing Lungi on to get back and he just about manages to.;
117.6;?;Hazlewood to Ngidi, no run right behind the line of this full delivery as he defends. Huge round of applause from the crowd;
117.5;1b;Hazlewood to de Villiers, 1 bye surely deliberate again? Fires this full and way down leg. AB can't do anything about it, Paine half-stops it. They scamper a bye. Should've been called wide, me thinks;
117.4;1;Hazlewood to Ngidi, 1 run shapes to help this down leg but somehow just gets some glove on it, wasn't far from Paine but AB decides to scamper the run. The throw is fired at the bowler's end where Warner fails to gather this cleanly and whip the bails off, because he was on the move.;
117.3;?;Hazlewood to Ngidi, no run lobs off the shoulder to gully. Rip roaring bouncer this from Hazlewood. Ngidi doesn't show any pain but this must hurt. Smack into the right shoulder as he looked to duck under that;
117.2;?;Hazlewood to Ngidi, no run solid thump down the ground but straight to mid-off;
117.1;4;Hazlewood to Ngidi, FOUR runs shapes to drive and gets a thick inside edge that squirts away past midwicket. Useful runs;
116.6;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run another full ball that is deliberately bowled down leg, AB swings and misses.;
116.5;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run full but down leg, AB looks swing this behind square but misses;
116.4;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run reaches out and cuts this short delivery to deep point, refuses the single;
116.3;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run slashes this slightly full delivery outside off to deep point;
116.2;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run yorker-length delivery honing in towards the off stump, dug out by AB;
116.1;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run dabs this incoming length delivery into the off side;
115.6;?;Hazlewood to Ngidi, no run somehow manages to avoid this short ball as he ducks under it;
115.5;?;Hazlewood to Ngidi, no run shows the full face of the bat and defends this full-length delivery;
115.4;W;Hazlewood to Maharaj, OUT that's the end of Maharaj's cameo. Shapes to pull but this wasn't as short as he expected. Through with the swing as the ball crashed into the bails.;Keshav Maharaj b Hazlewood 30 (38m 24b 3x4 2x6) SR: 125;
115.3;?;Hazlewood to Maharaj, no run scorcher of a drive but an excellent stop by Bancroft at cover;
115.2;?;Hazlewood to Maharaj, no run right besides the line of this length ball as he defends.;
115.1;?;Hazlewood to Maharaj, no run floats this full on off stump, defended from the crease;
114.6;1;Starc to Maharaj, 1 run another rip-roaring yorker on the stumps, this time from around the wicket. Maharaj just about manages to get his bat down in time to keep that out;
114.5;?;Starc to Maharaj, no run right into the blockhole on leg stump, kept out by Maharaj somehow. He was off balance;
114.4;4;Starc to Maharaj, FOUR runs slashed away over point. Picked the bones out of this. The half-century stand is up too! Even AB enjoyed that cut.;
114.3;4;Starc to Maharaj, FOUR runs nails this short ball that he fetches from outside off to the deep midwicket fence. Enterprising batting that looks really fun when it comes off.;
114.2;4;Starc to Maharaj, FOUR runs delightful off-drive. This was floated full, Maharaj was quick to pounce on it. Intended to bowl a yorker, turned out to be a half-volley;
114.1;?;Starc to Maharaj, no run angles a short ball into the stumps from around the wicket, Maharaj looks to duck but ends up having a swipe at it, beaten.;
113.6;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run massive shout for lbw as AB is struck on the pad attempting a reverse paddle. Given not out, Australia review immediately. Was it turning too much? Would it have missed leg? Plenty of questions. This ball was nicely tossed up but lands on middle and leg, misses AB's paddle and hits him just below the knee roll. Hang on, there's a very very small spike, possibly off the glove. So they didn't even look at ball tracking. Onfield decision of not out stays. Australia have exhausted their reviews;
113.5;1;Lyon to Maharaj, 1 run back and across as he turns this shortish delivery to square leg;
113.4;?;Lyon to Maharaj, no run cut away but can't pick the gap, straight to backward point;
113.3;1;Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run lunges forward and turns this wide of midwicket;
113.2;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run turns this to short fine, refuses the run though;
113.1;4;Lyon to de Villiers, FOUR runs short on middle, he moves to the leg side to make some room and gives this a proper whack. Walloped to the deep point fence;
112.6;1;Starc to de Villiers, 1 run too much width outside off, he runs it down to third man;
112.5;2;Starc to de Villiers, 2 runs picked away towards Lyon, who dives around to stop that full-blooded flick at deep midwicket;
112.4;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run crunching cover drive, but they don't take the run again. Down to sweeper cover;
112.3;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run right on top of the bounce as he bunts this short of length delivery to the bowler;
112.2;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run lovely balance as he flicks this leg-stump half-volley to deep midwicket, refuses the single;
112.1;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run squeezes this drive to cover;
111.6;6;Lyon to Maharaj, SIX runs another heave and he's nailed this. Saw the flight and couldn't hold back as he stepped out and launched this over wide long-on. Timed this sensationally, onto the roof. The ball bounces back into the stands.;
111.5;?;Lyon to Maharaj, no run lunges forward and defends to the leg side with soft hands;
111.4;?;Lyon to Maharaj, no run on the shorter side, he goes back and across and turns this into the leg side;
111.3;?;Lyon to Maharaj, no run looks to whip this behind but is beaten by the turn;
111.2;1;Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run slow turn from leg stump, tucked behind square for an easy single;
111.1;1;Lyon to Maharaj, 1 run punched into the gap at cover, AB back on strike. Easily done;
110.6;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run right behind the line of this length ball in defense;
110.5;6;Cummins to de Villiers, SIX runs disdainfully pulled in front of square to clear deep midwicket. Took a step outside off, but AB created the length by going deep back into the crease and put this away magically.;
110.4;2;Cummins to de Villiers, 2 runs walks across the stumps and whips this length ball into the gap at deep midwicket. Excellent running;
110.3;2;Cummins to de Villiers, 2 runs hops back and punches this length delivery into the gap at deep extra cover, Mitch Marsh comes around to stop that;
110.2;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run tries to run it down but misses;
110.1;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run squirts this drive to deep point. AB refuses the single;
109.6;6;Lyon to Maharaj, SIX runs brain freeze from Maharaj, has it cost him? AB can't believe what he's just seen. This was nicely tossed up by Lyon, Maharaj is lured into this big, big heave with the spin. Didn't get to the pitch of the ball so didn't get the timing and power he would've liked. This would have still carried all the way if not for Khawaja's awareness. He kept his eyes on the ball, but may have miscalculated where the ropes were. As he caught the ball, his backfoot was in contact with the turf behind the ropes just before he lobbed the ball back up to catch it inside the field of play. Let-off technically. Maharaj and SA will heave a sigh of relief;
109.5;?;Lyon to Maharaj, no run lunges forward to turn this past midwicket but the ball beats the inside edge to lob off the pad towards the bowler;
109.4;2;Lyon to Maharaj, 2 runs makes room and punches this length ball into the cover region;
109.3;?;Lyon to Maharaj, no run steps out to whip this away but this lobs off the pad to short leg;
109.2;?;Lyon to Maharaj, no run turns this with the spin to short midwicket;
109.1;4b;Lyon to Maharaj, 4 byes bounce from the rough but this is too short. It just shoots up to beat the batsman and keeper, four byes.;
108.6;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run goes across and shows the full face of the bat in defence;
108.6;1w;Cummins to de Villiers, 1 wide shapes to pull but gets out of the way in the end. Paine does well to leap like a goalkeeper and stop that.;
108.5;4;Cummins to de Villiers, FOUR runs arches back and helps this short ball over the slips. What a way to bring up a hundred, his 22nd in Tests and his first since January, 2015. This is his first century in 13 Tests and he realises the value of it. Super, super knock;
108.4;1;Cummins to Maharaj, 1 run full on off, he squirts this push into the off side to get off the mark;
108.3;W;Cummins to Philander, OUT this time, Bancroft makes no mistake at short leg. Cummins hits the deck hard, gets good bounce. Philander plays in front of the body as he's caught on the crease, came off the splice again but lobbed at a comfortable height. Right at the stroke of the drinks interval;Vernon Philander c Bancroft b Cummins 36 (104m 85b 5x4 0x6) SR: 42.35;
108.2;?;Cummins to Philander, no run gets half a stride in as he squirts this length ball into the off side;
108.1;?;Cummins to Philander, no run dropped at short leg by Bancroft. This came off the splice of the bat as he looked to turn this gently. He did well to move to his left but couldn't get low enough.;
107.6;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run shapes to play an expansive drive but he's deceived in flight, ends up pushing hard to mid-off;
107.5;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run goes back and across as he tucks this straight into the short leg fielder on the bounce;
107.4;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run right to the pitch of the ball as he defends this tossed up delivery on middle;
107.3;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run not much turn, this just drifts away, AB lunges forward, covers the line and blocks;
107.2;1;Lyon to Philander, 1 run right on top of the bounce as he turns this wide of short leg;
107.1;?;Lyon to Philander, no run stretches forward and defends this tossed up delivery that drifts in a long way;
106.6;1;Cummins to Philander, 1 run drives to get a thick inside edge down to deep midwicket;
106.5;?;Cummins to Philander, no run shows the full face of the bat in defence of this length ball on the stumps;
106.4;?;Cummins to Philander, no run gets half-forward and jabs this length ball into the off side;
106.3;?;Cummins to Philander, no run big appeal again. Too much bounce? Smith ponders a review and decides against it. Philander plays all around this length ball angling in and is hit on top of the knee roll. This would've gone over?. Hawkeye suggests it would've clipped, so would've been umpire's call at best. So Australia wouldn't have lost a review even had they taken one.;
106.2;?;Cummins to Philander, no run plays outside the line of this delivery that angles in to hit him high on the thigh pad.;
106.1;?;Cummins to Philander, no run short ball but way over Philander's head, avoided easily;
105.6;1;Lyon to Philander, 1 run short, sitting up nicely and he pulls this to deep square leg;
105.5;1;Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run too short, AB makes room and cuts to Starc at deep point;
105.4;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run drifts away across the batsman, AB drives firmly but straight to cover;
105.3;1;Lyon to Philander, 1 run sharp turn but from way outside off, Philander waits for the turn and then tucks this to square leg;
105.2;1;Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run right on top of the bounce as he wrists this towards square leg;
105.1;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run bounce from the rough, spins back in to hit AB on the inside thigh as he looks to turn this to the leg side;
104.6;?;Cummins to Philander, no run shapes to play an on-drive, toe-ends it to short mid-on.;
104.5;?;Cummins to Philander, no run thick edge, but does well to take his bottom hand off the grip, lands short of second slip.;

99.5;4;Starc to Philander, FOUR runs this is gorgeous! You'd pay good money to watch a cover drive like that. Right to the pitch of the ball, nice-high elbow as he presses forward to essay a delightful drive. This was asking to be hit and he did;

69.6;?;Hazlewood to de Villiers, no run back of a length outside off, 133 kph, pushed to cover from the back foot. A maiden.;
69.5;?;Hazlewood to de Villiers, no run good leave. It's the other one, the ball that moves away after pitching. Left alone;

69.1;?;Hazlewood to de Villiers, no run back of a length outside off, 134 kph, defended back from the crease;
68.6;?;Starc to du Plessis, no run goes short, down leg, not well directed. Easily negotiated.;
68.5;?;Starc to du Plessis, no run full outside off, driven to mid-on, 143 kph;
68.4;?;Starc to du Plessis, no run full and wide outside off, left alone.;

68.2;1;Starc to de Villiers, 1 run a fullish delivery outside off, tapped away towards gully. The ball goes through Khawaja for a run, 143 kph. Don't think Starc will mind that, he's had success against Faf already this series.;
68.1;4;Starc to de Villiers, FOUR runs driven through cover. And the crowd goes wild. Full and wide, AB leans into a drive, finds a big gap.;
67.6;W;Hazlewood to Elgar, OUT edged and gone! That was too good. This has been a terrific spell of reverse swing bowling. A full delivery outside off, Elgar prods, the ball moves away like an offbreak, takes the outside edge and goes through to Paine. A very gritty 57, but Australia are right back in this one.;Dean Elgar c ?Paine b Hazlewood 57 (306m 197b 6x4 0x6) SR: 28.93;

66.5;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run strays down leg, 141 kph, de Villiers misses a flick.;
66.4;W;Starc to Amla, OUT gone through Amla! A full delivery outside off, the ball has been reversing and this one does too! If Amla can't lay bat on it, it's going to be a tough time for the rest of South Africa. The point of release is wide of the crease, it looks destined for middle from that angle, but the ball straightens ever so late, beats the outside edge and uproots off stump! What a delivery. Too good even for Amla.;Hashim Amla b Starc 56 (203m 148b 6x4 0x6) SR: 37.83;
66.3;2;Starc to Amla, 2 runs on the pads, flicked away through midwicket for a couple. A dangerous shot with the ball reversing, but he's been there awhile.;

62.1;?;Cummins to Amla, no run good length with shape away. Left alone;
61.6;?;Marsh to Elgar, no run beaten as he looks for yet another expansive drive against Marsh. Overpitched and moving away late outside off, the feet didn't bring him close to the ball;
61.5;?;Marsh to Elgar, no run good length at off stump and it spits up at him as he looks to defend on the front foot. Rams the inside shoulder of the bat and squeezes into the leg side;

60.1;?;Cummins to Elgar, no run short ball pitches outside leg and goes further down. Left alone;

Matt: "Only 2 overs from Marsh? What's the point of having an all rounder if you don't bowl him?Once again poor captaincy from Smith." --- He was ill and off the field for a long time.
