7.27 pm: David Warner is so unknown the MCG scoreboard operators didn't even have a photo of him when they showed the teams. But then, neither did they have one of Luke Ronchi, because the two men are not Cricket Australia contracted. How will we be able to tell them apart? asks Brydon Coverdale from the MCG.
Taylor, Hayden, Langer, Gilchrist, Marsh, and now Warner ... all left-hand openers.
Toss, 7.05 pm: Ricky Ponting's won it, and Australia will bat. Teams in a moment ...
South Africa have two debutants in their XI - Vaughn van Jaarsveld and Lonwabo Tsostobe. They should be fun names to spell (hurrah for cut, copy, paste!). Herschelle Gibbs also returns to the squad ... Hashim Amla, Neil McKenzie and Morne Morkel have been rested.
South Africa: 1 Herschelle Gibbs, 2 Jacques Kallis, 3 AB de Villiers, 4 JP Duminy, 5 Vaughn van Jaarsveld, 6 Mark Boucher (wk), 7 Albie Morkel, 8 Johan Botha (capt), 9 Dale Steyn, 10 Makhaya Ntini, 11 Lonwabo Tsostobe.
Australia have also rested Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson. David Warner will make his debut, it won't be long before we see him in action because he's supposed to open the innings. He hasn't even played a first-class game yet ...
Australia: 1 Shaun Marsh, 2 David Warner, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Hussey, 5 David Hussey, 6 Cameron White, 7 James Hopes, 8 Luke Ronchi (wk), 9 Nathan Bracken, 10 Ben Hilfenhaus, 11 Shaun Tait.
There are a few minutes to kill before the start. We've got some wallpapers of Australian and South African players for you to download.
6.58 pm: Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the first Twenty20 international between Australia and South Africa at the MCG. A crowd of about 70,000 is expected but there aren't that many yet. It'll fill in in the next hour or so, so if you're in the vicinity of the MCG, head on down. Or you could follow it here ... Binoy George will be scoring the game and I'm George Binoy, your commentator for the next few hours. Cheers!
Twenty20's thrill is so different from Test cricket - and what a series we've witnessed - but who doesn't like a four-runs-off-one-ball finish? Last year's Twenty20 thrash between Australia and India was a massive anti-climax, let's hope this one is a better contest.
We'e moments away from the toss, and about half an hour away from the start. You could start a discussion on Cricinfo's Facebook page in the mean time.
 Innings Start
10.42 pm: Australia have won the first Twenty20 by 52 runs. The victory was set up by bolter David Warner's audacious 89 off 43 balls. He hit seven fours, half a dozen sixes and led Australia to 182.
South Africa's chase was wrecked after Gibbs fell in Bracken's first over and Tait knocked the wind out of de Villiers. Duminy played a superb innings but he had little support from the other batsmen.
No prizes for guessing that David Warner is the Man of the Match. Remember he hasn't even played a first-class game. "It's unreal," he says. "It feels a lot different from Bondi (beach). I was a bit nervous."
The second Twenty20 game is on January 13 in Brisbane. Do join us for that one. Until then, this is George Binoy signing off. Cheers!
