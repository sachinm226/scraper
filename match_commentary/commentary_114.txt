5.10pm So, Australia amass 310 for 8, which might have been a big total ten years ago, but right at this moment of time, it feels a touch underwhelming. But credit where it is due to Australia. Two centuries have given them a fighting chance, and an ODI ground record too. Back in 40 for the resumption
Chas Stewart: "Who's the joker who thought Willey wasn't a death bowler. Two overs, eight runs, four wickets. Enough said." I don't think he's a death bowler either, to be fair. But he came to the party well today.
A very England-at-the-2015-World-Cup total. How did that pan out? Oh ...
49.6;2;Willey to Jhye Richardson, 2 runs thumped to cover, and that's the end of Australia's spirited innings;
49.5;1;Willey to Lyon, 1 run cracked airily out to cover, where Morgan pounces with one hand, which briefly discombobulates Richardson. But he gets back safely;
49.4;?;Willey to Lyon, no run length ball, fizzes through a wild swing;
49.3;2;Willey to Lyon, 2 runs slammed high in the air, who wants this? Willey wants this! He sprints out to midwicket, but can't quite reach it to complete his five-for;
49.2;W;Willey to Paine, OUT round the wicket, angled into the pads, and Willey strikes again! Another slog across the line, but was he struck outside the line? Paine can't be bothered to review... but that was umpire's call ... very marginal!;Tim Paine lbw b Willey 3 (5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60;
49.1;1;Willey to Jhye Richardson, 1 run smeared along the ground to long-on, lining up the outswing and connecting well enough;
48.6;1;Wood to Jhye Richardson, 1 run rolls the fingers on another attempted yorker, chopped out to backward point;
48.5;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run crunched out to deep cover;
48.5;1w;Wood to Paine, 1 wide wider line, speared down the leg side this time;
48.4;?;Wood to Paine, no run well bowled again, a pinpoint yorker, nothing for Paine to do but dig it out;
48.3;1;Wood to Jhye Richardson, 1 run attacking the stumps on a full length, clipped hard to long-on;
48.2;?;Wood to Jhye Richardson, no run an under-edged smear, Buttler does well to drop a glove on it;
48.1;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run attempted yorker, tailing into the pads, chiselled round the corner to bring up the 300;
47.6;?;Willey to Jhye Richardson, no run yorker, well dug out. That was a lively over;
47.5;W;Willey to Neser, OUT edged, gone, and it's three in the over! Who says Willey isn't a death bowler? Neser makes room outside leg, feathers his off-side slap and Australia are subsiding rapidly;Michael Neser c ?Buttler b Willey 2 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
47.4;2;Willey to Neser, 2 runs thumped out to deep midwicket;
47.3;1;Willey to Paine, 1 run cracked to mid-off to survive the hat-trick ball;
47.2;W;Willey to Marsh, OUT stunning from Roy on the long-on boundary! Another massive wind-up, it dips late on the boundary's edge, where Roy clings on, running towards the rope. He has the presence of mind to pick out Craig Overton ten metres away, running round from midwicket, his team-mate accepts the side-handed lob, and that is Willey on a hat-trick!;Shaun Marsh c Overton b Willey 101 (92b 5x4 4x6) SR: 109.78;
47.1;W;Willey to Carey, OUT low full toss, swinging into the toes, and Carey holes out to deep midwicket! He nailed it, to be fair, but straight to the man.;Alex Carey c Overton b Willey 6 (5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 120;
46.6;6;Rashid to Marsh, SIX runs smashed high over the leg side, and up comes Shaun Marsh's second hundred of the series! Absolutely brilliant acceleration in the later stages of his innings, and it's a 91-ball hundred, which is useful in any context;
46.5;2;Rashid to Marsh, 2 runs thumped out to the deep;
46.4;4;Rashid to Marsh, FOUR runs hooned through the covers, this is a terrific turn of pace from the hobbling Marsh. Cracking it on the up to ruin Rashid's figures;

46.2;4;Rashid to Marsh, FOUR runs shorter, wider, pushed out of the front of the hand, and just helped behind square;

40.1;1;Ali to Agar, 1 run round the wicket, back of a length, chopped out to deep cover;
39.6;1;Wood to Agar, 1 run stabbed through third man to get off the mark;
39.5;W;Wood to Stoinis, OUT bowled him! That is a beauty from Wood, shaping in, just a hint of reverse maybe, skidding through Stoinis's half-cocked defences. Had he got forward he might have had more chance ... of lbw;Marcus Stoinis b Wood 1 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
39.4;1;Wood to Marsh, 1 run flipped to the leg side;
39.3;?;Wood to Marsh, no run solidly onto the front foot, and walloped to mid-off. There's been a lot of that today, technically correct drives straight to the fielder. Oodles of respect for the bowling;
39.2;1;Wood to Stoinis, 1 run outside off, a thick outside edge, through to third man;
39.1;W;Wood to Finch, OUT oh, pinned him in front! Finch is plumb lbw playing across the line, Wood has the breakthrough out of nothing! It was all very placid out there, and now Finch has missed a straight one;Aaron Finch lbw b Wood 100 (106b 6x4 3x6) SR: 94.33;

7.5;4;Willey to Head, FOUR runs another lovely drive, clean through extra cover with a big stride and a full face;
7.4;1;Willey to Finch, 1 run back of a length once again, on a middle and leg line, Finch tries to work it square but can't connect properly;

7.2;?;Willey to Finch, no run tapped to the leg side, gathered at short midwicket;
7.1;?;Willey to Finch, no run defended off the back foot, gathered in the followthrough;

6.4;?;Wood to Head, no run banged in short, Head ducks;
6.3;?;Wood to Head, no run flicked to leg, looking for the single, but Buttler swoops;
6.2;4;Wood to Head, FOUR runs sweetly on-driven! Just a touch over-pitched from Wood, right under the eyeline and launched back through the bowler's grasp;
6.1;?;Wood to Head, no run back of a length, Wood falls over in his followthrough, but he's delivered the ball nicely into the channel. Poked to point;
5.6;?;Willey to Finch, no run tucked to the leg side;
5.5;?;Willey to Finch, no run back of a length, glided out to point where it is gathered on the run to prevent the single;
5.4;4;Willey to Finch, FOUR runs crunching drive! This is better intent from Australia, striding out to meet the ball and flogging it clean through the covers;
5.3;1;Willey to Head, 1 run chiselled in the air, out to deep midwicket;
5.2;4;Willey to Head, FOUR runs fenced into the gap clean down the ground, that's superb timing! Met the ball on the top of the bounce and eased it through long-on;

4.6;?;Wood to Finch, no run full and straight, no way through there, pushed to cover;

2.3;?;Wood to Finch, no run tight to the off stump, pushed into the covers;

1.5;3;Willey to Finch, 3 runs lovely strike, meeting the full length with a compact drive, perfectly bissecting the two cover fielders;

1.3;?;Willey to Head, no run curling away from the left-hander, two slips in place as Head leans forward to defend;
1.2;1lb;Willey to Finch, 1 leg bye curling into the pads, a bit of an ambitious single but Buttler's shy from behind the stumps is about as hopeless as you'll ever see in international cricket;
1.1;?;Willey to Finch, no run back of a length, and sure enough, this one tails back a touch and cracks Finch high on the pads;
0.6;?;Wood to Head, no run tapped into the leg side, that's a good recovery from that first-ball four;

0.2;?;Wood to Finch, no run wider line, 86mph, might have been given as wide but for a toe-ended thump to point;
0.1;4;Wood to Finch, FOUR runs short, and dismissively hoicked through backward square leg! Decent pace, but that was nailed!;

1.59pm Right, let's play some cricket! Mark Wood to take the new ball
1.54pm MW: "@Malvino, all is not lost on your brilliant maths-ing. Turning it around, 635 in 50 overs gives a run rate of 12.7. So whatever score Australia make divided by 12.7 is how many overs England will need to chase it down for victory."
1.49pm Tim Paine won the toss to lift Australian spirits... has the mood change made it all the way to Samara? I think it might have, you know...
And talking of all things pig-bladdered, my trusty sidekick Alan Gardner has jumped the shark outrageously in this piece of bandwagon-jumping cross-platform box-ticking. Would Messi or Ronaldo make a better cricketer? Go on, feed the clickbait ...
Jamie Dow: "Alex Carey ... er .... nope! Who is he?" Well, quite
1.46pm Rivlud: "Who would you guys make favourites for the World Cup 2019 in England? I feel England may have peaked just under a year early, everyone thought England would win the Champions Trophy but they were poor against Pakistan. I think India have both the attack and batting line-up to win it next year!" My money's on Australia... they are the Pakistan de nos jours...
1.44pm "That's a crying shame," wails Malvino. "I've been crunching some numbers to try to work out what England's score would have been if they had batted first: Based on their innings so far this series, 218 to 342 = 124 increase, followed by 342 to 481 = 139 increase. There's a difference of 15 in the increase there, so add another 15 to 139, then add that to 481 and MATHS decrees that England would have made 635."
Well, I'm never one to let some good maths-ing go to waste. Especially when the decision at the toss condemns it to the realms of the hypothetical.
Jacob: "Is it just me or do I get the sense that Australia are trying to prevent the embarrassment of another massive England total? After all, Morgan wanted to bowl. Go Aussies!! " Yes. I strongly suspect this to be the case...
1.39pm Tiggsy has something he wants to get off his chest: "I like him, but selections like Overton's today is what's wrong with recent thinking. Just because they 'saw something they liked' in the Ashes and 'think he's a competitor' doesn't mean he's a good List A player. If anything the Ashes showed he just lacks that something extra that makes an international level player. There are loads of bowlers on the circuit with much better List A stats than Overton and more deserving of a shot."
I would argue that both Overton and Tom Curran were found out in the Ashes. But Curran in particular has been a revelation as a death bowler in ODIs. Similarly, Overton's willingness to bang out a length could be handy in the middle overs. Let's give him a whirl before we judge him too harshly...
1.30pm Heads is the call, Australia bat!
"Looks pretty good, a little dry underneath," says Tim Paine, who has brought Nathan Lyon into his side for the first time this series. "Today's a new game, we've got to come out with a positive mindset."
Eoin Morgan would have bowled first anyway. "Earning the right to win a game like we did the other day took a lot of hard work from the batters," he says. He expects conditions to be different, but it'll be Australia's turn to have first hit today.
Maxwell's injury is his right shoulder - some suspicion he damaged it while fielding on the boundary in the last game. Australia have gone for the extra bowler, with D'Arcy Short paying the price of the team's failure at Trent Bridge. Finch returns to the top, Alex Carey comes in at No.5, and the allrounder Michael Neser returns to the team.
England 1 Jason Roy, 2 Jonny Bairstow, 3 Alex Hales, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan (capt), 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 David Willey, 9 Craig Overton, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Mark Wood
Australia 1 Aaron Finch, 2 Travis Head, 3 Shaun Marsh, 4 Marcus Stoinis, 5 Alex Carey, 6 Tim Paine (capt & wk), 7 Ashton Agar, 8 Michael Neser, 9 Jhye Richardson, 10 Nathan Lyon, 11 Billy Stanlake.
1.28pm Right, time for the toss. Let's get this gallumphing great show on the road. Nasser Hussain is out in the middle at Chester-le-Street. A decent surface with a good covering.
1.27pm Glenn Maxwell is thought to be out with injury, which is a major blow to Australia's hopes. Michael Neser may get a recall, with Andrew Tye probably heading off to lick his wounds...
dez: "The Overtons are great cricketers but they're not really white ball players... Would have given Sam Curran a shot if T Curran & Ball are unavailable."
Liam: "Sir Ian Botham fell while fishing. England soccer team coach Gareth Southgate fell while jogging 10k... What is happening! " Exercise is bad for you
1.20pm "Botham fell when fishing and hurt his hip," says George, because we know it's what you were all wanting to know. Sounds fishy to me
Rhys : "Overton? Really? Sporting a list a average of 33? Hardly a replacement for plunkett" Got to start somewhere
1.15pm So, as hinted earlier by George, Craig Overton is set to make his ODI debut today. He is about to receive his cap from Sir Ian Botham, who is incongruously hobbling around on crutches today... a proud moment. Plunkett is the man to miss out today.
Tom Curran, meanwhile, is heading back to London to continue his rehab, but is expected to be fine for the T20s against India.
1.06pm Awww maaate ... look away now if you're of an Antipodean disposition....
Joseph Wilson: "Quite windy up here today, may be a factor."
1pm "It's a sell-out crowd," says George. "Lovely day. Ball has lower back niggle. Curran has side strain. Again a niggle." Impressive effort from England's back-up selections to go lame without playing a part in the carnage so far.
12.55pm So, Australia are down and out in the cricket already, trailling 3-0 with only pride to salvage. Happily for the most sports-ing nation of them all, their footballers still have hope in the World Cup ... for now at least. They are about to kick off against Denmark in their own must-win encounter... follow it live at ESPN.com.
12.52pm It's been a frankly ludicrous week of record-smashing... I mean, how can Alex Hales smash 147 from 92 balls, and still be fearful of his place in the team.
And how can New Zealand's Suzie Bates lead a ransacking of the Women's T20 record total, only for that record to be pulverised by England's women only hours later?
It's madness, that's what it is.
12,50pm George is back with what sounds like pretty definite team news. "Plunkett rested. Overton in. Tom Curran has side strain. Not official but pretty confident.
Wood plays. *points at face; circles finger*..."
12.45pm Hello and welcome to the morning after the night before. England and Australia have decamped to the northern reaches of Chester-le-Street to see what comes next in this most record-smashing of white-ball weeks.
Because, as Andrew McGlashan asked in his preview yesterday, what does come after 481 for 6?
Here's George Dobell, our eyes and ears on the ground, with some early news. "Ben Stokes is bowling on edge of square. Gentle - well, as gentle as anything he does - but encouraging." He's not expected to play any part in this series, but he's always been one to defy medical opinion.
 Innings Start
9.20pm: Right, thanks for sticking your head in again, we've had fun in the sun up towards the wall. England roll on, 4-0 up with one to play: George's report will tell the story, then why not pop over to ESPN FC for the latest from the World Cup? That's it from us for tonight, join us again for more slam-bam exploits from Old Trafford on Sunday. Bye!
9.10pm: Presentations time, Mike Atherton is joined by Australia captain Tim Paine: "Yeah, thought we were 30-40 short, Shaun and Aaron batted really well but we didn't quite finish off. [Enough to challenge?] Thought we were in the game for a patch, didn't quite execute up front and Jonny and Jason jumped all over it. [Another tough dy - dropped Hales] I'm trying to enjoy it, when it rains it pours, you've got to catch those but it just bobbled out. We came here with an inexperienced side and while it's not an excuse, we're up against the best side in the world and they're red hot at the moment. We've got to keep learning and take things out of the game, this will hold them in good stead."
England captain Eoin Morgan: "Thought we played pretty solid cricket, lost the toss and our objective was to chase something that was within our grasp. We struggled to take wickets but managed to control the run rate, which is nice when the batting line-up we have is firing. [300 easy for you now?] It depends on conditions, feedback was that the wicket was good, Jos' evaluation, 'Was it a good score, a chaseable score?', and certainly at halfway we thought it was within our grasp. [Overton debut] He impressed, his opportunity came today, he his straps, which was awesome. There might be an opportunity in the next game. [Aiming for 5-0] We like playing at Old Trafford, the challenge is to finish it off."
Jason Roy is Man of the Match: "I'm feeling like I'm in a good training routine, just want to get out there and do my job. Just trying to control my innings, pace my innings, so I can set some good foundations. Unfortunately I didn't kick on today. [Relay catch to remove Marsh] Was just hoping I would catch it and for Overs to dig me out. The big fellow did well."
9pm: England stroll home with 32 balls to spare, completing their second-highest chase in ODIs with barely a flutter of nerves to go 4-0 up in the series. That was almost as brutal as the other day, dismissively seeing Australia's hard-fought 310-8 and raising them so high they had to fold. Jason Roy made his second hundred in three innings, Jonny Bairstow just 79 off 66 today, and then Jos Buttler trashed any lingering hopes Tim Paine might have had of his bowlers pulling something out of the fire. Australia's top three all produced good innings on paper... but from 225-1 they somehow managed to produce a total that was barely par. Their tough trot goes on.

9.1;?;Agar to Roy, no run pushed through, beats the outside edge and Paine whips off the bails... they are going to check upstairs, Roy did shift his back foot fractionally but I don't think it was in the air at the time. No, Dharmasena's happy he was in;

5.1;4;Lyon to Bairstow, FOUR runs pushed through, bit of turn but the ball sits up nicely on off stump and Bairstow carves it through point for four;
4.6;?;Neser to Roy, no run fourth-stump line, driven on the up to extra cover;
4.5;2;Neser to Roy, 2 runs too straight, this is flicked off the legs wide of short fine and Stanlake has to lumber into gear to prevent a boundary;
4.4;?;Neser to Roy, no run short but taking the pace off, Roy is through his pull shot early and gets a bottom edge wide of the Paine, who gets across;

2.5;?;Neser to Bairstow, no run turned into the midwicket area;
2.4;?;Neser to Bairstow, no run slams into the back leg, Neser goes up... but Michael Gough shakes his head! Maybe nipping down the leg side? Ah, perhaps some inside edge on it, too;

1.5;?;Stanlake to Roy, no run good length on off, defended this time;

0.1;4;Neser to Roy, FOUR runs short and on the hip, Roy clips it firmly away, past the dive of short fine leg for four off the first ball! Well, I suppose Finch did the same;

Here come Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow, not exactly fresh off the back of 481 - having spent a few sweaty hours in the field - but raring to go, I'm sure. Michael Neser will open the bowling
Hello again. We'll be cracking on with the run chase at CLS soon enough... This is the approach I expect England to take. Once upon a time, 300 was pretty much the final frontier for chasing - England managed it twice between 1971 and 2014 - but times have changed. Won't be long before we have a strong idea of whether Australia have come in underdone
