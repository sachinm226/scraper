The England team are in a huddle on the field
The Australians are all out of the dressing-room and coming down to congratulate Lee and McGrath

This is Anand Vasu, your commentator, saying what a pleasure it has been bringing you the commentary.
We shall hang on a bit more to bring you some of the post-match comments from the captains
The presentation ceremony is just beginning
As usual the first thing is medallions for all the match officials
Michael Vaughan of England comes up first to have a chat "It's great that we're playing good cricket. This game had everything. Hundreds, wickets, everything. But I would really like to congratulate my team. In the last three weeks we have shown great c
'A few tired bodies in our unit,' says Vaughan. 'Lot's of work for everyone in the last two weeks. A bit of a rest now before the next Test.'
'Ponting played a fantastic knock. He held their innings together,' adds Vaughan. 'Congratulations to Ricky. He played brilliantly.'
Ricky Ponting is the Man of the Match for his epic match saving 160
'Yet again that was an amazing game of cricket,' says Ponting. 'We were outplayed for the first four days. We dug in deep on the last day. Towards the end of the day I thought I might've cocked things up. But Lee and McGrath hung on well.'
'we are training hard enough and preparing hard enough,' says Ponting 'but you need to do it out in the middle when it counts. We played some good cricket today. Now we have some time off and can get away from the cricket for a couple of days.'
And with that we come to the end of our coverage of this Test match.
It has been a real pleasure bring this game to you. We hope you enjoyed being with us.
Till the next Test, this is Anand Vasu, your commentator, saying cheers and goodnight, tipping his hat off to England, Australia, and not least the hero of the day, Ricky Ponting!
