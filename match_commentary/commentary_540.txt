Good disciplined show from South Africa to bowl out Australia for 209. How will their batsmen go about their task? Remember, they have new openers. Join us in a short while for the reply.
71.6;W;Steyn to McGain, OUT 209 all out. Full and straight outside off, McGain is caught at the crease and hangs his bat out and stabs it to third slip.;Bryce McGain c de Villiers b Steyn 2 (22m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;

71.4;?;Steyn to McGain, no run short and wide outside off, McGain thinks about having a dab but decides against it;
71.3;W;Steyn to Johnson, OUT Mitch is gone, going for a six. It was a length delivery and a tad slower as well and Johnson got under the ball more than he wanted and got elevation instead of distance. Prince ran to his left from long-on to hold on to the ball. Nine down.;Mitchell Johnson c Prince b Steyn 35 (73m 54b 6x4 0x6) SR: 64.81;

70.6;?;Harris to McGain, no run leans forward to defend;
70.5;1;Harris to Johnson, 1 run dropped by Imraan Khan at deep midwicket. What a mess. Harris had dragged back the length after seeing Johnson advance and it was swung straight to Imraan who didn't judge it all all. He seemed to be going back instead of taking couple of steps forward. He realised his mistake and rushed forward. Too late. Clang!;

68.3;4;Harris to Johnson, FOUR runs Johnson opens his shoulders. Flighted outside off and Johnson swings it over wide midwicket. Here we go. Will he keep going after Harris? Will Harris get him?;

68.1;?;Harris to Johnson, no run leans forward to defend down the pitch;
67.6;?;Ntini to McGain, no run edged again but falls short of second slip. Similar delivery and another jab but this one rolls away to AB;
67.5;W;Ntini to Siddle, OUT Ntini takes out Siddle. He straightens a length delivery outside off and Siddle lunges forward to stab it to left of second slip where AB swallows it. Out for a duck. Eight for 190.;Peter Siddle c de Villiers b Ntini 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
67.4;?;Ntini to Siddle, no run in the outside off stump channel and left alone;
67.3;W;Ntini to McDonald, OUT Ntini's patience has paid off. McDonald walked across outside off again. Ntini kept it full and even further outside off.

66.1;1;Harris to McDonald, 1 run flighted on the leg stump line, turned towards wide midwicket region;

63.5;?;Ntini to McDonald, no run;
63.4;?;Ntini to McDonald, no run ends up outside off and Ntini fires in a bouncer and McDonald ducks;
63.3;?;Ntini to McDonald, no run moves towards off stump, again exposing the stumps, almost daring Ntini to bowl it on middle and leg, flicked from off to midwicket;

62.1;?;Harris to McDonald, no run on the off stump line, defended to the off side;
61.6;?;Ntini to Johnson, no run again close to the off stump and Johnson shoulders arms .. again seemed a tad close to leave; hope he knows his off stump well;

59.5;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run It's a yorker and crashes into the pad before Johnson can get the bat down from that high back lift. Steyn turns around to appeal but it was missing leg stump.;
59.4;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run short in length, cutting across from the leg stump line, pushed back to the bowler. Johnson then suggests that he should have pulled that one. Hmm... let's see what happens next ball. Will it be a yorker? or a bouncer?;

59.2;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run suddenly, this over, the back lift has got higher and pushed this one to the on side. Perhaps, Steyn will fire in a fuller one now;

55.4;2;Steyn to McDonald, 2 runs short in length, clipped off the pad past square leg;
55.3;?;Steyn to McDonald, no run Ouch. It has crashed into the helmet. It was a snorter, coming in at McDonald who takes his eyes off the ball and just ducks his head and the ball hit him flush in the middle of the helmet.;
55.2;?;Steyn to McDonald, no run in the channel outside off stump, McDonald has nothing to do with it;
55.1;?;Steyn to McDonald, no run lifting delivery outside off stump and McDonald pulls his bat away from the line of the ball;
54.6;?;Harris to Johnson, no run on the off stump line, full, pushed to silly point;
54.5;?;Harris to Johnson, no run flighted outside off, doesn't turn in much and Johnson lets it go past the off stump;
54.4;W;Harris to Haddin, OUT Trapped in front but Haddin, after checking with the non-striker, has gone for the review. It landed on the middle stump line, skidded through quickly to rap him on the pad in front of middle and leg. That's dead duck. No inside edge and the height looks ok as well. Bucknor got it right. Haddin got his bat almost sideways from the off side, rather than from behind the ball, suggesting he didn't pick the arm-ball. He was looking so good in the last session but has been plucked out early in the last .;Brad Haddin lbw b Harris 42 (101m 67b 8x4 0x6) SR: 62.68;

53.5;?;Steyn to McDonald, no run fuller but outside off stump, checking to see if McDonald has a brain freeze but everything is working there and he lets it go through to the keeper;
53.4;?;Steyn to McDonald, no run on the front foot, defending to the on side;
53.3;1;Steyn to Haddin, 1 run another probing delivery, fuller and Haddin is late in getting his bat in front but manages to push the ball to the on side;
53.2;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run loud shout for lbw but t'was too high. It cut in from outside off, Haddin was on the hop back and failed to connect with his defensive waft;
53.1;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run gets back to push it to the off side;
52.6;?;Harris to McDonald, no run leads forward to play an unconvincing push to the off side.;
52.5;?;Harris to McDonald, no run another bat and pad but this one goes through silly mid-on. Again, it drifted in, McDonald was driving outside the line and it bobbed off the pad but went in front of the wicket;
52.4;?;Harris to McDonald, no run pushed through to mid-on;
52.3;?;Harris to McDonald, no run leans forward to defend to the on side;
52.2;?;Harris to McDonald, no run edged but not to the hands. It drifts in to beat the forward defensive poke and bobs away off bat and pad to right of Amla at short-leg who couldn't get a hand to it. It wasn't that far from him and there was a inside edge. Amla was slow to react. Where is David Boon, he would have swallowed that;
52.1;?;Harris to McDonald, no run gets well forward to defend to the off side;

51.3;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run cutting in towards middle, pushed towards mid-on, sets off for a run, McDonald responds but Haddin pulls out of the run.;
51.2;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run full pitched and driven superbly straight but oh boy too straight .. it cannons off the stumps at the other end.;
51.1;1lb;Steyn to McDonald, 1 leg bye runs off the thigh pad to the on side;
50.6;?;Harris to Haddin, no run full, almost yorker length, dug out to the on side;
50.5;W;Harris to Katich, OUT Kato is gone. The readers have woofed him out I think. What an uncharacteristic shot. It was on a length outside off stump, Katich dragged it from there, attempting a sweep shot but could only top edge it to close on the leg side and Imraan Khan takes his first Test catch. Remember he had dropped Katich at point in Ntini's opening spell.;Simon Katich c Khan b Harris 55 (229m 160b 7x4 0x6) SR: 34.37;
50.4;?;Harris to Katich, no run floated full outside off stump, driven hard but Duminy makes a diving stop to his left;

49.3;?;Kallis to Haddin, no run on a length, around the middle and off stump line, pushed past the bowler to mid-on;
49.2;?;Kallis to Haddin, no run;

44.1;1;Harris to Katich, 1 run slip and short leg watch as Katich reaches his fifty with a little drive towards mid-off. He was in some trouble early on against Ntini but has hung around to graft another important fifty;
43.6;4;Morkel to Haddin, FOUR runs ah, close! Haddin chases a full, wide, swinging delivery and just spoons in in the air behind backward point to raise the 50-run stand, a loose shot but he survives;
43.5;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run another full one in the blockhole and Haddin digs it out in time;
43.4;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run gets tall and punches a good-looking shot off the back foot but Amla at cover times his dive to his right superbly and denies Haddin runs, good stuff there;

43.2;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run on the pads again and this time turned to midwicket;

41.4;?;Morkel to Katich, no run Boucher crouches to catch the ball in front of him as he shuffles to his left side!;
41.3;?;Morkel to Katich, no run back to regular programming. Boucher collects.;
41.2;?;Morkel to Katich, no run hmm looks he also ran out of patience on this occasion . He went for the cut outside off, it was not so short and he couldn't connect;

 Innings Start
So South Africa all out for 651. They lead by 442. A mountain to climb. AB indulged himself, Albie had fun and even Harris threw his bat around. Much fun for the crowd. That's tea as well. Join us in a while for the final session.
Andrew Coan: "More records: this is SA's third highest test score(only 682/6 v Eng and 658/9 v WI both 2003 ahead of them); 12 sixes is the most by SA in an innings (previous best 10, best ever 17 by Aus hayden 380 v Zim); 61 is most extras ever shipped by Aus (by a distance - 52 their previous 'best')- the record for all teams is 76 "
Cliff: "further to Brendan's comments regarding test #1661, in test #408 (Australia V's West Indies) five of the West Indian bowlers where hit for over 100 runs, plus their 6th bowler was hit for 99 (Garfield Sobers)."

 Innings Start
What an innings from Mitch. Whaddaplayaaaa! However, despite that glamorous knock, Harris has handed Australia a rare innings defeat. Last time they folded up by an innings was on March 21st 1998 in Calcutta. Thanks Tobes for doing the commentary from tea. It must have been great fun.
The game was lost on day 1 when Australia folded up for a below-par 209. The pitch remained batting friendly throughout and South Africa bossed around with the bat and the ball till Mitch came on to play an entertaining knock.
Kallis: "It's [captaincy] a tough job but it was made easier by guys giving advice around. The guys played well from the start. It was a fantastic stuff from Harris.
On 3-3 in the six Tests between these two sides: "It's probably a fair reflection on how cricket has gone.
Harris is the Man of the Match : First five-wicket haul from a South African spinner in South Africa in 44 years: "I have played good cricket and enjoyed it really well. It was a good Test wicket' nice to see some turn in the end and I have thoroughly enjoyed playing against these guys [Australia] who I have admired a lot.
Johnson is the Man of the series: "I have enjoyed it. Lot of credit has to go team; our bowling attack stuck together and I fed off it. Thanks to the support stuff. It's a bit disappointing to lose here today. I enjoy my batting and hope there is more hundreds in the future.
on 3-3 in the six Tests:" I think it's a fair reflection".
Ponting: "It has been a fantastic series of cricket as the series in Australia was. We came back and rectified, at least in the first two Tests. Full credit to South Africa for playing as well as they did here. Our batting was not up to it in the first innings. Full credit to both the teams; the standard of cricket was very attractive. There is no doubt that with one-day series and 20-20, both teams will put up a good show. These are two very good cricket sides and will be for no of years to come. As a result of the last two months the rivalry is getting bigger and bigger. I have a fair bit of cricket left in me as i hope the senior South Africans. I have enjoyed the contest. "
This was Steve Bucknor's last Test. That's it from us. On behalf of Kip, our scorer, and Tobian Clayton, who did the text commentary post-tea today and had all the fun with the grand Mitch show, this is Sriram Veera signing off.

Sanjay: "Since you have brought the bunny out. Clarke, Ponting, and Hussey have been the worst performers on this tour. I thought both tests were won due to the batting of North and Hughes and bowling of Siddle and Johnson. Ponting has been performing poorly since the India tour and Hussey is going back in his average faster than he was going up. "
