Rajith: "Srilanka's batting order MUST be changed. Sanga and Mahela must go one step down and youngster like Chandimal should batted at no. 3 position. If Jeewan Mendis not playing Samaraweera can fill his place. Because he is a good off spinner. Regarding Chamara.... Very sorry I must say."
arnab: "Those stats are revealing, Australia has quite a good ODI side despite the retirements partly due to the nature of the format and the replacements (watson for gilly, bowlers aplenty for mcgrath) really what cost Australia the WC was the lack of replacements for Symonds and Hogg, that's what stops them from being excellent rather than merely quite good as they are now."
Australia are struggling? They certainly aren't in one-dayers. In the last two years, they have won 46 of their 65 games, a win-loss ratio of 3.06. The closest are South Africa, with a win-loss ratio of 2.
This is the fourth-lowest total in a completed first innings in a full game at the Premadasa, and the second-lowest for Sri Lanka. Sums up their performance. They were playing with a long tail today, and Chamara Silva as well, who clearly hasn't got any confidence going. 0, 6, 7, 1, 0, 0 read the scores of the last six batsmen. Once Kumar fell, the rest followed in a heap.
With Silva out of touch, they had five batsmen. Two fell to wild shots, the third found the fielder on his first aggressive shot and the fourth charged blindly as soon as he came in. Too much left for the fifth to do, even if he is of the class of Mahela Jayawardene
On another note, Sri Lanka's capitulation has covered up Australia's woeful over-rate. They had more than 11 overs to bowl with barely 25 minutes left
ryan: "You are struggling with the bat, and havent been able to get enough runs on the board so what do you do.. drop a batsman? Ridiculous logic, about as poor as thinking you can go into an ODI in the subcontinent without a frontline spinner @ MrPrez and co :P"
ricky: "instant effect of the argus review."

38.3;W;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT Binga! Accurate bouncer, Jayawardene looks for the flick-pull, gets a top edge, and Lee runs towards square leg to complete the catch. Huge wicket, Jayawardene could still have hurt Australia;Mahela Jayawardene c & b Lee 53 (149m 102b 4x4 0x6) SR: 51.96;

37.5;W;Doherty to Prasanna, OUT is that another one, Prasanna goes for the review as umpire Hill gives him out leg before, it was the tossed up ball that carried straight in, he pushed outside the line and was struck on the pad, that would have hit middle and off, and Sri Lanka have lost the review, best figures for Xavier Doherty;Seekkuge Prasanna lbw b Doherty 0 (7m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

3.1;?;Bollinger to Dilshan, no run the ball is coming on nicely, but Dilshan's push finds short extra cover as he gets forward to a length ball going across;

2.5;?;Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run some width outside off but tharanga finds Ponting this time with the cut;
2.4;1;Lee to Dilshan, 1 run well played, but Ponting at backward point rolls back the years with a dive to his left and a one-handed stop, Dilshan had used Lee's pace very well to open the face and push through the line, that was travelling;
2.3;?;Lee to Dilshan, no run Dilshan looking for the swat-punch through extra cover, Lee bowls a slower one back of a length, and Dilshan cannot get any timing on the shot;
2.2;1;Lee to Upul Tharanga, 1 run plays late, well done, allows the length ball to come in with the angle, and drops it towards midwicket;
2.1;1;Lee to Dilshan, 1 run shortish and he latches on to the pull right away, keeps it along the ground through square leg too, rolling his wrists over the ball;
1.6;?;Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, no run bit of away shape for Dougie, but this time Tharanga leaves outside off;
1.5;4;Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, FOUR runs tharanga gets going with an inside edge, oh well, what's new you say, throws his bat from the crease at one close to off stump, but it goes fine on the leg side past the keeper;
1.4;?;Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, no run now he goes outside off stump, Dougie, and gets lots of bounce as it moves away from back of a length, Tharanga tried to go on the toes and cut but the bounce beat him;
1.3;?;Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, no run Dougie gets the angle going, in the left-hander from short of a length, and he takes it on the body as he misses the work on the leg side;
1.2;1;Bollinger to Dilshan, 1 run more bounce as he goes back of a length, Dilshan pushes purposefully in front of cover with an open face and they take the first run of the game;

0.4;?;Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run Lee puts more effort in a shortish one, hits Tharanga hard on the bat as he pushes towards cover;
0.3;?;Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run goes back of a length now, so three different lengths in three deliveries from Lee, Tharanga keeps it down on the leg side and Lee rushes forward to field;
0.2;?;Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run more pace on this one now from Lee, 134.7 kph, much fuller too, Tharanga is not particularly to the pitch and pushes carefully to mid off;
0.1;?;Lee to Upul Tharanga, no run going across Tharanga from a length, not much pace first up, and left alone easily;

All set for the start, the Premadasa is abuzz with lots of people as usual. Alright the Australian huddle is done with, and the Sri Lanka openers are in the middle. Brett Lee will run in to two slips and a short fine leg to Tharanga
Growler: "@ MrPrez... agree 100%. We can use Pup and/or D Hussey to bowl spin as a back-up to the pace. We should be picking the 4 best bowlers regardless of style with Watto/Pup/D Hussey providing the extras."
MrPrez: "Why do Australia feel like they must play a spinner? If they don't have a quality one, go in with an extra pace bowler! SA did that and it worked decently, and Clarke can bowl a few if need be. Not ideal of course, but is an average state spinner really better to have than a quality pacer?" Absolutely spot-on
Rajith: "I have a Million Dollar question to ask from the Srilankan selectors. "What Chamara Silva has done better than Dinesh Chandimal to stay in the squad and play 2 games?""
James: "On the argus review, australia have been calling out for a full time selector for years now. perhaps this will give our test side, and number 1 spinner position a bit more stability." The latter really could do with loads of stability, James.
Luke: "For the most part very impressed by the Argus review and hopeful for the future as long as now they've got rid of the wrong people they manage to find the right ones. As Argus himself said, it's all in the execution now."
johann: "Hilditch out, Smith out, Nielsen on the way? who will we blame now if we lose?"
Kangon: "So, Sri Lanka playing with 4 batsmen, one all rounder, 5 bowlers and a Chamara Silva? God bless."
Lots of feedback supporting the move to drop Smith, and push Haddin down the order. What about the Argus review? Sweeping changes, but about time too, you guys reckon?
Blake: "Phew!!! i thought steve smith was gonna become the next cam white, originally brought in as an allrounder and then morphed into a batsman that hardly bowls, leapfrogging better equiped specialist batsman in the process."
Daniel: "Brave decision to play Prassana!! Aus struggled against the pace of malinga,mystery of Mendis and the the variations of Eranga!! now Prasanna."
Ron: "Marsh in for Smith. This move is long overdue. All they need now is Paine to replace Haddin."
Mitch: "Its about time Australia brought in another batsman, with Watto opening the batting and having another allrounder in the lower order, we have been 1 short for considerable amount of time."
James: "about time steven smith was dropped... his lack of performance throughout this series and the odi world cup/england odi series in australia have really called for it."
2.10 pm Russell Arnold says on air that the pitch is dry and hard, all the grass has been taken off. He thinks it will hold up well, and will play well right through the game. Will turn more as the game goes on, get slower as well. He thinks 275 will be a good score
2 pm Sri Lanka have won the toss and will have a bat.
Dilshan: "We have brought in another spinner and the track will help the spinners." Seekkuge Prasanna, the legspinner, straight in from England, and straight in to the side for his debut. He has first-class and List A averages below 20 too . Australia have run into another unknown commodity
Clarke: "Looks pretty dry and will take a bit of spin, will probably be slower than those we have seen in the previous three games. We would have definitely batted first." Shaun Marsh is in at the top of the order, he comes in for Steven Smith, finally Haddin drops down the order, about time I say
Tim Nielsen, the Australia coach, whose position is currently on the line as well after the Argus review: "All we can control is how we play and present ourselves. We cannot control anything else."
1.50 pm And then they woke up, and the world around them had changed. Welcome to Australia's first game after the Argus report which has brought about far-reaching changes in the way the game will be run in the country. Michael Clarke, the captain and now also a selector, will need to have lots of 'adult conversations' with the players and his co-selectors, and has been given a position that makes him far more accountable than ever before. The much-criticised Andrew Hilditch is out for now as Australia hunt for a full-time chief selector.
That said, there is a game to be played with a series on the line. Sri Lanka looked very much the dominant side they usually are at home in the previous game, and will enjoy coming back to their citadel, the R Premadasa Stadium. The last match between these two sides here finished in a washout, in the World Cup 2011. Have a look at Brydon Coverdale's preview while we wait for the start.

Clarke: "Great performance with the ball, Marsh won the game pretty much on his own, he played the two T20s, was training really hard, faced a lot of spin in the hands, and deserved his chance. Doherty was fantastic, Lee took four as well. Another game for Australia [coming up], and we would like to finish 4-1."
Xavier Doherty is the Man of the Match. Doherty: "Obviously coming from Australia, was looking forward to bowl in these conditions, was nice to get some wickets today after getting a bit of tap in the previous game. Just [looking] to focus more on one-day cricket, so far so good."
Dilshan: "We cannot get out for 130, we bowled well, cannot ask bowlers to defend 130 against a strong batting line-up. I think Prasanna has a good future for Sri Lankan cricket. Clarke batted really well."
Kumar Sangakkara gets a memento for playing 300 ODIs
Australia have back-to-back series wins in Sri Lanka, they won here in 2003-04 as well. It was a pretty safe chase till Marsh's dismissal led to two more wickets in the same over from debutant Prasanna. Sri Lanka's thin batting line-up caved in cheaply after Sangakkara fell, and there was no getting back from that.
Ahmed: "I assume this is the first time that 2 brothers got out to the same bowler in same match in same over with some score on board & scoring same number of runs."
ryan: "ah D.Hussey's failure taken in isolation is nothing, but really has he played a substantial innings yet for australia? More tothe point he looks out of depth, bring on Ferguson!"
