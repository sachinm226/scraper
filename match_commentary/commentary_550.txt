Data
Australia have collapsed, squandering an excellent start provided to them by Watson. Ten wickets fell for 66, and like in the early part of the ODI series, the Australian batsmen were virtually clueless against spin, especially Afridi. Gul came back to wrap up the innings, dismissing North, Lee and Hauritz in quick succession to finish with impressive figures of 4 for 8. Pakistan should chase this down, though they'll be wary of the slow pitch, and the comebacks Australia are capable of, which they witnessed first hand in the ODIs. Join us in a bit.

National Anthem time, and everyone's up.
The VIP's are gradually making their way in and the players have lined up on the field. The Sheikh's having a word with the two teams. There's a decent crowd in, and will only grow. The first match of its kind in the UAE, and expectedly, there's a big reception.
There is a delay folks. The game will only start after the Sheikh arrives, so we'll just have to wait it out. An unprecedented stoppage this, as far as I know.
Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the Twenty20 game between Pakistan and Australia being played in Dubai. The news from the middle is that Pakistan have won the toss and opted to field. Younis Khan will not be playing, and Misbah-ul-Haq will step in as captain. Australia have included Brett Lee - he's been out for a while.
Pakistan: Misbah-ul-Haq (capt), Salman Butt, Ahmed Shahzad, Shoaib Malik, Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal (wk), Umar Gul, Fawad Alam, Shoaib Akhtar, Sohail Tanvir, Saeed Ajmal.
Australia: Brad Haddin (capt and wk), Callum Ferguson, Nathan Hauritz, James Hopes, Marcus North, Andrew Symonds, Shane Watson, David Hussey, Brett Lee, Ben Hilfenhaus, Nathan Bracken.
Still a few minutes to go for the start, so read the preview to the game in the meantime.
 Innings Start
A one-sided affair in the end, though it didn't look to be going that way when Watson was going strong in the Australian innings. But the spin of Afridi, and the accuracy of Gul saw to it that the Australians were kept down to a paltry score. Butt started well, but when both openers fell in fairly quick succession things seemed a little shaky for Pakistan. But Akmal was in prime form, and his counter-attack hastened the win, though one musn't forget the calm hand played by their captain Misbah at the other end. Stay tuned for the presentation.
A joint Man-of-the-Match award here, for Gul and Afridi.
Afridi: "I enjoyed my performance, and the pitch gave me good support. I experimented in the nets it the hard-work paid off."
Gul: "I practiced a lot with the old ball. Hopefully we'll win the World Cup after this."
Haddin: "We were outplayed, we weren't on our game. The World Cup is going to be totally different, but we have to improve. We've got a couple of weeks off before the World Cup, so that should do us good."
Misbah: "Afridi and Gul bowled superbly to bring us back in the game. Akmal carried his form superbly into this game after his performance in the last ODI, and we hope he'll carry this form into the World Twenty20. Everyone knows their role and it's going well."
That's all from here folks. Thanks for tuning in, sending us your feedback, and it's been a pleasure bringing you these six matches. Take care, sleep well. Adios!
