Welcome back. Here we go, the huddles are over and we are ready to roll. It'll be Liam Plunkett to take the new ball. Mal Loye will not be taking the field after that blow to the jaw during his innings. Paul Collingwood substitutes.
Well, at long last we have a game on our hands between Australia and England. Ed Joyce, dropped on 6 by Shaun Tait, made his maiden hundred to help England to 292 for 7 as all the Australian bowlers struggled. The rate needed is 5.86 but the pitch looks good and this should be a very interesting chase. Join us 6.35pm (0735GMT) to see how they get on.
49.6;1;McGrath to Plunkett, 1 run yorker, well dug out towards extra cover and a single to end;
49.5;4;McGrath to Plunkett, FOUR runs overpitched and Plunkett smacks it over wide long-on for a one-bounce four;
49.4;2;McGrath to Plunkett, 2 runs driven uppishly to long-off and Bopara runs well to the danger end for a second;
49.3;?;McGrath to Plunkett, no run short and Plunkett looks surprised that it was not called wide. He has a point, but as long as the umpires are consistent it doesn't matter;
49.2;1;McGrath to Bopara, 1 run full toss which Bopara looks to swing to leg, gets a leading edge and the ball hangs in the air before dropping feet in front of White racing in to mid-off;
49.1;?;McGrath to Bopara, no run full, good ball which Bopara can only dig out;
48.6;?;Tait to Plunkett, no run Plunkett aims to run the ball through the slips but misses;
48.5;1;Tait to Bopara, 1 run bumbled into the leg side;
48.4;4;Tait to Bopara, FOUR runs sweet one-day shot, opens the face of the bat and uses Tait's pace to the full as the ball is angled through second slip;
48.3;1;Tait to Plunkett, 1 run bobbled into the off side and a scampered single as Tait fields;
48.2;2;Tait to Plunkett, 2 runs two steps and sliced to third man;
48.1;1;Tait to Bopara, 1 run glanced to long leg;
48.1;1w;Tait to Bopara, 1 wide short and wide down the leg side;
35.6;1;McGrath to Joyce, 1 run short, pulled to deep midwicket;
35.5;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run this time he steps back and finds more room, punching it wide of cover to the man in the deep;
35.4;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run Flintoff cramped as he looks to thwack into the off and he can only push the ball to point;
35.3;1;McGrath to Joyce, 1 run same shot, but this time Joyce finds the gap and ambles a single as third man fields;
35.2;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run steered into the slips and slap bang into the one man there ...he's at third slip;
35.1;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run Joyce back and defends;
34.6;?;White to Flintoff, no run turned straight to Symonds at midwicket;
34.5;?;White to Flintoff, no run steps back and punches to mid-on;
34.4;1;White to Joyce, 1 run swept again, straight to the man in the deep so only ever one;
34.3;2;White to Joyce, 2 runs swept to deep square leg, good tag fielding on the rope from Bracken and Clarke;
34.2;?;White to Joyce, no run again pad, and this time a loud appeal as well. Nothing doing there, though;
34.1;?;White to Joyce, no run Joyce down the track and pads it back;
47.6;W;McGrath to Dalrymple, 1 run, OUT driven to long-on, the two players get in a real mess over the second and both end up at the bowler's end ... Dalrymple goes but surely Bopara should have sacrificed himself;Jamie Dalrymple run out (Clarke/?Gilchrist) 30 (27m 18b 3x4 1x6) SR: 166.66;
47.5;4;McGrath to Dalrymple, FOUR runs full toss and smashed wide of midwicket where it evades the desperate dive of White;
47.4;2;McGrath to Dalrymple, 2 runs McGrath responds with a yorker which Dalrymple hammers down the ground;
47.3;6;McGrath to Dalrymple, SIX runs yet again banged in but this time Dalrymple on it quickly and it goes all the way over midwicket ...it only just carries and it's dropped by the spectator leaning over the fence ...Tait's family enclosure?;
47.2;?;McGrath to Dalrymple, no run short of a length outside off stump, and another swing and miss from Dalrymple;
47.1;?;McGrath to Dalrymple, no run short and Dalrymple swings and misses;
46.6;W;Tait to Nixon, OUT another one banged in, and this time Nixon plays a really nothing semi-pull shot which lobs to extra cover. A short and certainly not sweet stay.;Paul Nixon c Hodge b Tait 4 (3m 2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200;
46.5;4;Tait to Nixon, FOUR runs short, Nixon hooks and gets a top edge over Gilchrist for four;

46.3;?;Tait to Dalrymple, no run Dalrymple moves to leg, swishes and misses. That was 93mph (150kph) which is pretty remarkable at this stage with an old ball;
46.2;W;Tait to Joyce, OUT banged in, Joyce plays a tired pull which he doesn't get hold of and the ball loops to wide midwicket. A great ovation as he walks off. His innings has given England something to bowl at and also ensured that John Buchanan gets his wish of making sure Australia are in a game at last;Ed Joyce c Bracken b Tait 107 (201m 142b 10x4 0x6) SR: 75.35;

33.3;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run;
33.2;1;McGrath to Joyce, 1 run short again;
33.1;W;McGrath to Bell, OUT and the drinks break brings a breakthrough once again! And it's that old shark McGrath who does the job. It was short, Bell went for a big swing, and Gilchrist steadied himself under a big top-edge;Ian Bell c ?Gilchrist b McGrath 51 (96m 60b 4x4 0x6) SR: 85;
32.6;?;White to Joyce, no run;
32.5;?;White to Joyce, no run tighter now, after those loose early deliveries;
32.4;?;White to Joyce, no run;
32.3;1;White to Bell, 1 run excellent rotation of the strike;
32.2;1;White to Joyce, 1 run;
32.1;1;White to Bell, 1 run driven down the ground, and that's Bell's fifty - his first against Australia. Well played;
32.1;1w;White to Bell, 1 wide loose again. Not good bowling;
32.1;3w;White to Bell, 3 wide loose again. Short, rank and leg-sided. Bell misses with his swing, but so does Gilchrist with his take;
31.6;?;Symonds to Joyce, no run down on the sweep again, and good contact as well. Nine off the over;
31.5;?;Symonds to Joyce, no run better line and length. Defended;
31.4;2;Symonds to Joyce, 2 runs clipped off the pads. Good batting;
31.3;2;Symonds to Joyce, 2 runs played through leg again. Some easy pickings at the moment;
31.2;1;Symonds to Bell, 1 run more good scampering brings up the hundred stand. Well played chaps;
31.1;4;Symonds to Bell, FOUR runs shot! Drifts onto the pads, and that's clipped up and over midwicket for another boundary;
30.6;?;White to Joyce, no run good finish, Joyce leaves alone outside off stump;
30.5;?;White to Joyce, no run clipped into the leg-side;
30.4;?;White to Joyce, no run Joyce plays for non-existent spin, and uncomfortably so;
30.3;2lb;White to Joyce, 2 leg byes strays onto leg this time;
30.2;?;White to Joyce, no run "bowled Barry!" says Gilchrist, and he's right;
30.1;?;White to Joyce, no run good start, nice flight, nice line;
29.6;1;Symonds to Joyce, 1 run the end of an eventful over, now here's Cameron White.;
29.5;2;Symonds to Joyce, 2 runs another miss! That was an inside-edge onto the pads, and it bobbled past Gilchrist! Lucky, lucky;
29.4;?;Symonds to Joyce, no run;
29.3;?;Symonds to Joyce, no run deflected behind square;
29.2;?;Symonds to Joyce, no run dropped! In the air to his left, and Symonds grabs with his weaker hand. That was a slower delivery, but he should have got it. And he's cross;
29.1;4;Symonds to Joyce, FOUR runs sweet strike through extra-cover! That was a gentle loosener, but Joyce cracked it almost one-handed on the up!;
28.6;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run another nudge towards the cordon. Steady stuff;
28.5;1;Bracken to Bell, 1 run pushed out to point;
28.4;?;Bracken to Bell, no run driven back down the ground, and that's quick work from Bracken! He fielded in his followthrough and Bell might have been out if his shy had hit;
28.3;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run drawn forward with a defensive push, finds the gap;
28.2;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run a swing and a miss to follow up - that was rash. Down the track and a big hoon over cow corner, but hit nothing but air;
28.1;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run bit loose outside off stump. A dab and a miss;
27.6;?;Clarke to Bell, no run good ball to finish, line and length and maybe even some spin;
27.5;?;Clarke to Bell, no run leg-sided, misses out with a glance;
27.4;1;Clarke to Joyce, 1 run excellent running between these two. Another dab to third man;
27.3;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run;
27.2;3;Clarke to Bell, 3 runs reverse-sweep - or dab, rather, as he did nothing more than deflect the ball. Found the gap through backward square;
27.1;2;Clarke to Bell, 2 runs down on the sweep, and that's a thick inside-edge. Bit streaky, but gets away with it;
26.6;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run takes the pad, and that's the over;
26.5;2;Bracken to Joyce, 2 runs that's a lovely strike. Clip-driven, if you like, through midwicket all along the ground. Just picked up inside the rope;
26.4;1;Bracken to Bell, 1 run leg-side again, and dabbed to midwicket;
26.3;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run steered calmly to third man to bring up a very fine fifty for Ed Joyce. His second in consecutive matches. Well batted;
26.2;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run straighter and angled towards off stump. Defended back down the pitch;
26.1;1lb;Bracken to Bell, 1 leg bye outside leg, takes the thigh pad, but that's another good quick single. Good communication;

25.5;1;Clarke to Joyce, 1 run couple of quick steps down the pitch to pick the gap;
25.4;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run fuller length, and defended;
25.3;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run down on one knee, and drilled over square leg. Not quite timed though, and swept up on the boundary's edge;

25.1;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run turned to midwicket;
24.6;2;Bracken to Bell, 2 runs clipped into the deep to complete the over;
24.5;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run steps across his stumps and turns this to mid-on for another single. Good rotation of the strike;
24.4;1;Bracken to Bell, 1 run;
24.3;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run another quick single into the covers;
24.2;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run turned into the leg-side;

23.5;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run;
23.4;1;Clarke to Joyce, 1 run;
23.3;2;Clarke to Joyce, 2 runs flapped out into the deep. Bit of a top-edge;
23.2;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run;
23.1;?;Clarke to Bell, no run dabbed into the covers, and a scampered single;
22.6;?;Tait to Joyce, no run fuller but slightly off-line. Joyce can't get it away though;
22.5;?;Tait to Joyce, no run;
22.4;1;Tait to Bell, 1 run;
22.4;5w;Tait to Bell, 5 wide tried to follow up with the yorker, but that was sprayed down leg. Nice idea, poorly executed;
22.3;?;Tait to Bell, no run snorter! That was short, quick, straight, and vicious. Bell played it very well to be fair, watching closely and swaying out of line;
22.2;?;Tait to Bell, no run driven firmly but fielded in the followthrough by Tait;
22.1;2;Tait to Bell, 2 runs strays onto the pads, clipped away;
21.6;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run drifted across Joyce, and that was a bit of a loose waft. And he knows it;
21.5;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run good flight, calm defence;
21.4;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run clipped to leg;
21.3;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run paddle-sweep to fine leg. Good measured shot;
21.2;?;Clarke to Bell, no run "nice Pup!" says Gilchrist, good line and length, and flight too;
21.1;1;Clarke to Joyce, 1 run starts with a gentle leg-stump half-volley. Clipped away;
20.6;1;Tait to Joyce, 1 run banged in, swung away. A useful over for England;
20.5;4;Tait to Joyce, FOUR runs that's a lovely strike from a man who's really starting to flourish now! Gave himself heaps of room by retreating to leg, and thwacked that through the covers. Nick Knight would be proud;
20.4;3;Tait to Bell, 3 runs fuller length, and nicely timed down the ground by Bell.;
20.3;1;Tait to Joyce, 1 run short and swung into the leg-side. Cleaned up on the square-leg boundary;
20.2;?;Tait to Joyce, no run outside off, driven without much power;
20.1;?;Tait to Joyce, no run good swinging full length. Maybe not as sharp as his first spell, but rapid nonetheless. Nothing has dropped below 90mph yet (144kph);
19.6;?;Clark to Bell, no run outside off stump, and left alone to finish;
19.5;1;Clark to Joyce, 1 run defended with an angled bat to point. The batsmen rotate the strike again;
19.4;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run bang! Symonds takes out the leg stump at the non-striker's end, but Bell is home for another single;
19.3;1;Clark to Joyce, 1 run slightly squared up, but safe;
19.2;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run another nudge into the gully, and a near-miss on that quick single. Joyce forgot that Clarke is left-handed in the field, and that might have been out if he had hit!;
19.1;?;Clark to Bell, no run good wheels, Stuey, good wheels. Right in the channel again;
18.6;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run attacking intent - down the pitch to meet McGrath, and a leading edge deflects through point;
18.5;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run tighter line, just back of a length. Joyce plays inside the line again;
18.4;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run width, and nudged down to third man;
18.3;1;McGrath to Joyce, 1 run quick single from a nudge into the gully. The shy was way off target though;
18.3;1w;McGrath to Joyce, 1 wide strays down the leg side. Another extra;
18.2;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run fuller, and drawn forward to defend;
18.1;?;McGrath to Bell, no run oooh! Sawn in half by a big nip-backer. Passed through bat and midriff;
17.6;?;Clark to Joyce, no run pushed into the covers to complete another tidy over;
17.5;?;Clark to Joyce, no run straighter, and defended back down the pitch;
17.4;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run width, and slapped past point;
17.3;2;Clark to Bell, 2 runs a fraction short, and Bell swings into a big ambitious pull over midwicket. Goes high, but well in front of the man in the deep. Decent shot;
17.2;?;Clark to Bell, no run line and length, respectfully defended;
17.1;?;Clark to Bell, no run turned to leg, another loud call stops the single;
16.6;4;McGrath to Joyce, FOUR runs lovely strike. McGrath is serving up far too many four-balls by his own high standards. Width again, and cracked past point for another boundary;
16.5;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run tries to turn this to leg, but slightly squared up;
16.4;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run probing stuff, played with an angled bat into the gully;
16.3;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run shorter and straighter - defended off the back foot to point, and a loud "No!";
16.2;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run again, good carry to the keeper from outside off stump. Joyce plays inside the line, as is his wont;
16.1;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run bit of nip again for McGrath - he's liking this track;
15.6;?;Clark to Bell, no run bit of a fish outside off stump that time! It bent away from the bat at the last minute, and Bell was tempted. Still, he lives on;
15.5;?;Clark to Bell, no run dropped in a touch short, and this one is defended into the gully;
15.4;1;Clark to Joyce, 1 run defended into the covers, and a scampered single;
15.3;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run width, and a measured carve through point;
15.2;4;Clark to Bell, FOUR runs lovely strike. Good stride and perfect placement, straight through extra cover;
15.1;?;Clark to Bell, no run good line and length to resume;
14.6;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run outside off, and nudged down to third man;
14.5;?;McGrath to Bell, no run a bit of a squelch as this one nips back to hit Bell amidships. He's not fussed though. Balls of steel;
14.4;?;McGrath to Bell, no run shoulders arms again;
14.3;?;McGrath to Bell, no run width but left alone. Sensible batting;
14.3;1nb;McGrath to Bell, (no ball) better line and length this time. A loud "NO!";
14.2;4;McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs short and wide again! Strangely erratic from McGrath, and Bell - perhaps astonished to get two such rank balls in succession hits this harder and in the air in front of point!;
14.1;4;McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs short and wide and deservedly timed through the covers. Bell didn't try to hit that too hard, just placed it behind point. Well played;
13.6;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run attempted yorker, but easily driven out for a single to mid-on. Bell keeps the strike, which Australia might not mind too much;
13.5;?;Clark to Bell, no run that one fizzed through! Lots of oohs and aahs, but no real alarms for Bell;
13.4;?;Clark to Bell, no run on the money again. Defended into the covers;
13.3;?;Clark to Bell, no run wicket-to-wicket. Turned into the leg-side;
13.2;?;Clark to Bell, no run banged in a bit this time, but outside off again and left alone;
13.1;?;Clark to Bell, no run outside off stump once again. No great pace or movement;
12.6;4;McGrath to Joyce, FOUR runs shorter, and that's an excellent swivel-pull to dent McGrath's ego at the end of the over;
12.5;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run starts outside leg but nips back to take the thigh pad;
12.4;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run slightly wider but still in the channel. Left alone;
12.3;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run fizzes past the bat with a bit of cut and good carry;
12.2;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run straighter and squared up as Joyce attempts to work to leg;
12.1;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run probing line, just back of a length and angling across the left-hander. Defended off the back foot;
11.6;?;Clark to Bell, no run drawn forward and played coolly into the covers. Solid over;
11.5;?;Clark to Bell, no run outside off stump and played on the up to cover;
11.4;?;Clark to Bell, no run just back of a length, defended with a loud "NO!";
11.3;1;Clark to Joyce, 1 run clipped off the pads and another stuttering single. These two won't have batted together very often;
11.2;?;Clark to Joyce, no run good length, and defended with a hint of inside-edge;
11.1;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run off the mark straight away, but a bit of hesitation there! Tickled to leg but safely home;
10.6;W;McGrath to Loye, OUT GOT HIM! McGrath dropped it short, as he was bound to do, and Loye tried to keep things positive by playing the hook. But it was a stroke played with no conviction, and a steepling top-edge ended in the hands of deep square-leg!;Mal Loye c Bracken b McGrath 29 (52m 33b 3x4 1x6) SR: 87.87;
10.5;?;McGrath to Loye, no run thunk! Good grief, down on the sweep, slight top-edge straight into the grille! McGrath looks as non-plussed as a fast bowler should when someone attempts to sweep them;
10.4;?;McGrath to Loye, no run excellent line and length this time, and some big seam movement back towards the stumps. Loye leaves alone with a flourish;
10.3;?;McGrath to Loye, no run straighter, and left alone;
10.3;1w;McGrath to Loye, 1 wide flashy flashy! It's that width again, and Loye just can't quite get it right with that shot. But it's too wide;
10.2;?;McGrath to Loye, no run same again. No pace, no movement, but just there;
10.1;?;McGrath to Loye, no run line and length, as you'd expect. Respectfully defended;
9.6;1;Clark to Loye, 1 run decent over for England;
9.6;1w;Clark to Loye, 1 wide wider, and Loye flinches in his eagerness to have a mow, but managed to restrain himself;
9.5;?;Clark to Loye, no run outside off, left alone;
9.4;3;Clark to Joyce, 3 runs fuller, but well timed through midwicket again. Clipped rather than carved though;
9.3;4;Clark to Joyce, FOUR runs short, and smeared through midwicket - that was a front-foot pull and it was hammered. Good batting;
9.2;?;Clark to Joyce, no run there's the intent. Joyce takes a couple of steps but defends nonetheless. Wasn't quite there for the shot;
9.1;?;Clark to Joyce, no run right on the money first up. Defended, but there's no swing;
8.6;4;Tait to Loye, FOUR runs much better shot, up towards the blockhole but swinging away. He didn't try to smack it, but it went like the proverbial through the covers all the same. When it's coming at you at 97mph, you don't need to have a mow!;
8.5;?;Tait to Loye, no run that's that tempter again, and Loye is drawn into it once again. Beaten by the swing, and just as well for his sake;
8.4;?;Tait to Loye, no run quick! Short and climbing at Loye, who fends this off his nose with a bit of discomfort;
8.3;?;Tait to Loye, no run slightly short, but rapid and Loye can't time his clip through leg;
8.2;1;Tait to Joyce, 1 run good yorker, squeezed out to the gully;
8.1;?;Tait to Joyce, no run 94.9mph that time, but nicely timed even though the direction was lacking. Steered into the gully off the back foot;
7.6;4;Bracken to Loye, FOUR runs no edges this time! That's a fine sweep, fizzes through square leg to complete an expensive over!;
7.5;4;Bracken to Loye, FOUR runs there's the sweep again! But this time it's a wild outside-edge that flies high over the slips. Still, it'll do;
7.4;1lb;Bracken to Joyce, 1 leg bye leg-sided again, clipped into space - in fact, it came off the pad but the intent was there;
7.3;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run shorter but straighter, and turned to leg with no great pace;
7.2;4;Bracken to Joyce, FOUR runs width, and smacked! That's a lovely shot - down the track, on the up, and over the covers;
7.1;1;Bracken to Loye, 1 run leg-side, and turned away for a quick single;
6.6;?;Tait to Joyce, no run right on the spot, swinging back towards off stump, and solidly pushed back up the pitch. Tidy stuff, and brutally quick as well!;
6.5;?;Tait to Joyce, no run swinging again, but a bit short and easily defended into the leg-side;
6.4;?;Tait to Joyce, no run yorker! And a good one too. Hastily dug out by Joyce;
6.3;?;Tait to Joyce, no run 96.1mph now, and that climbs past the left-hander's edge for Gilchrist to take above his head;
6.2;1;Tait to Loye, 1 run shorter, quicker, but defended on the hop into the vacant gully. 97mph that one, and Loye is shaking his finger, as well he might;
6.1;?;Tait to Loye, no run fancy that, it's a wide one, and he chased it!;
5.6;1;Bracken to Loye, 1 run back on a good length, and solidly defended;
5.5;6;Bracken to Loye, SIX runs there he goes! It's that slog-sweep again, and it's a big, big six again! Slight top-edge, but what power! Twelve rows back, I reckon;
5.4;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run fuller length, and pushed to leg;
5.3;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run tighter to the stumps and defended;
5.3;1w;Bracken to Joyce, 1 wide outside off, tight call, but that won't improve Bracken's mood;
5.2;2;Bracken to Joyce, 2 runs dropped! And that was a dolly. Joyce's first attacking move of the match, danced down the track, had a smear, and Tait at deep point fluffed a sitter;
5.1;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run a swish and a miss from Joyce - that was loose. Tempted by a hint of width, but good bounce and movement;
4.6;?;Tait to Loye, no run booming full-toss, Loye flings the bat but the outswing deceives him and he under-edges into the slips.;
4.5;2;Tait to Loye, 2 runs nicely timed through square leg, bit of a half-volley this time but Tait is finding a good rhythm after that erratic first over;
4.4;2;Tait to Loye, 2 runs attempted yorker, 90mph-plus but no movement, and easily squeezed to square leg;
4.3;?;Tait to Loye, no run speared down the leg-side, takes the pad but Gilchrist runs round to field;
4.2;?;Tait to Loye, no run right up to the bat, hint of movement and watchfully defended back up the pitch;
4.1;?;Tait to Loye, no run banged in, takes the glove and dribbles into the covers. Good aggression;
3.6;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run excellent over. Joyce defends into the covers;
3.5;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run straighter, and this time Joyce is forced to defend. Drawn onto the front foot;
3.4;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run outside off stump once again, Joyce shoulders arms once again;
3.3;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run good discipline from Bracken.;
3.2;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run probing, probing. No stroke again as the ball sits in the channel outside off stump;
3.1;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run fizzes through, no stroke offered;
2.6;?;Tait to Loye, no run right up to the bat, and an inside-edge bobbles into the crease as Loye drives again. Better over;
2.5;?;Tait to Loye, no run good pace again, Loye drawn into the drive, but controls his aggression;
2.5;1w;Tait to Loye, 1 wide 95mph, but misdirected, and slips past Loye's ribs for another extra;
2.4;?;Tait to Loye, no run fuller, outside off, and squirted to gully. Rapid;
2.3;?;Tait to Loye, no run big appeal from Tait, but that looked to be sliding down leg. Loye was well squared up though. Hawkeye disagrees ...;
2.2;2;Tait to Loye, 2 runs starts on middle-and-leg, decent swing again, but easily clipped to midwicket;
2.1;?;Tait to Loye, no run big booming outswing from Tait. Useful pace as well. Loye leaves alone;
1.6;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run curving towards the slips, and edged towards the gully. Safe though;
1.5;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run no stroke offered as the ball fizzes through;
1.4;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run good probing length outside the left-hander's off stump;
1.3;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run tighter, and just back of a length. Joyce plays inside the line again;
1.3;1w;Bracken to Joyce, 1 wide bit of width, but not too much. Strange call, to be honest;
1.2;1;Bracken to Loye, 1 run gets it a fraction wrong this time. Loye flicks to leg to get off the mark;
1.1;?;Bracken to Loye, no run good start, full length, curving in, defended on the front foot;
0.6;2;Tait to Joyce, 2 runs leg-side again, and Joyce tickles the last ball down to fine leg. A woolly first over;
0.6;1w;Tait to Joyce, 1 wide wild again. Arguably less wide than his first ball, but rightly called as Gilchrist takes in front of slip;
0.5;?;Tait to Joyce, no run banged in and bending back into the batsman. Joyce plays inside the line with a perpendicular bat;
0.4;4;Tait to Joyce, FOUR runs strays onto the pads and that's clipped firmly through midwicket to bring up the first boundary of the day. Good shot;
0.3;?;Tait to Joyce, no run wonderful response! Real pace, yorker length and inswinging. Joyce gets his bat down just in time;
0.3;1w;Tait to Joyce, 1 wide oops! That's almost Harmisonesque. Pitched on the white lines and swung towards the slips;
0.2;?;Tait to Joyce, no run better, straighter, and good carry as well;
0.1;?;Tait to Joyce, no run well, that was pretty erratic to start things off, but maybe because it's his first ball, he's been given the benefit of the doubt;

2.10pm The players are out on the field, and Shaun Tait will take the new ball in his first ODI.
2.00pm Andrew Flintoff wins the toss. England will bat.
Australia 1 Adam Gilchrist (capt, wk), 2 Matthew Hayden, 3 Brad Hodge, 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Andrew Symonds, 6 Mike Hussey, 7 Cameron White, 8 Nathan Bracken, 9 Stuart Clark, 10 Glenn McGrath, 11 Shaun Tait.
England 1 Mal Loye, 2 Ed Joyce, 3 Ian Bell, 4 Andrew Strauss, 5 Ravi Bopara, 6 Andrew Flintoff (capt), 7 Jamie Dalrymple, 8 Paul Nixon (wk), 9 Liam Plunkett, 10 Sajid Mahmood, 11 Monty Panesar. The 12th man is Jon Lewis.
So, Ravi Bopara is set to become England's 37th one-day cricketer since the 2005 Ashes, while Sajid Mahmood gets another chance to atone for his ODI beastings of 2006. Chris Tremlett has been quietly ditched, and Paul Collingwood is apparently ill.
1.40pm Good morning, and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the 10th match of the CB Series, between Australia and England at Sydney. I'm Andrew Miller, and I'm grimly fascinated by what we've got in prospect this morning.
Barring miracles (ie a home defeat) this will be the penultimate fixture of an England tour that has just got worse, and worse, and worse. Somehow, even if they did achieve the improbable and reach the finals ahead of New Zealand, you can't imagine they'd be too pleased about hanging around for further humiliation.
But enough of such talk. It's a new day, a new start, and a newish-look Australia team is set to line up against them. Brett Lee is expected to be rested to give Shaun Tait an opportunity to press for World Cup honours, while Ricky Ponting's strained hip means that Brad Hodge is also expected to play.
For England, however, there's yet more injury woe. James Anderson has flown home with back trouble, Michael Vaughan has been ruled out with that dodgy hamstring. Full team news to follow.
 Innings Start
That's it from us today. We've been Andrew Miller and Martin Williamson. Thanks for bearing with us through our technical glitches. Join us then from 0300 GMT on Sunday for the showdown between Australia and New Zealand at Melbourne.
Okay, so Australia had their foot off the pedal and their eyes on bigger contests, but it was still a worthy performance nonetheless. It was set up by Ed Joyce's maiden ODI century, and sealed by some tidy bowling from Liam Plunkett in particular.
Andrew Symonds will not bat, and so England, believe it or not, have achieved the unachievable, and beaten Australia by the hefty margin of 92 runs! That even means a bonus point, to put a teeny bit of pressure on the Kiwis ...
38.5;W;Plunkett to Clark, OUT Bell has sealed it with a run-out! Pushed on to the back foot, Tait was slow to start running, and Bell swooped from cover to ping down the stumps!;Shaun Tait run out (Bell) 11 (6m 10b 1x4 1x6) SR: 110;

37.2;4;Panesar to Tait, FOUR runs mowed down the ground! That was a good old-fashioned tail-end biff!;

33.6;W;Panesar to Bracken, OUT beautiful ball! Tossed right up, much much slower, and Bracken played all round it as the ball crashed into middle and leg. Another one bites the dust, and with Glenn McGrath now at the crease, it's safe to say the game is up. Or is it?;Nathan Bracken b Panesar 21 (34m 26b 3x4 0x6) SR: 80.76;
33.5;?;Panesar to Bracken, no run back on a better line and length. Deadbatted;

32.2;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run bouncer! And that's the one for the over;

26.4;?;Bopara to Bracken, no run sharp and tight, lively stuff;
26.3;?;Bopara to Bracken, no run a big appeal but that was sliding down leg. Good wicket-to-wicket bowling though;

23.6;1;Panesar to Hussey, 1 run tidy stuff from Panesar. Shambolic stuff from ... ahem ... us. But ho hum, what can we do? Sorry about all this;Andrew Symonds retired hurt 39 (64m 35b 4x4 1x6) SR: 111.42;

21.2;1;Panesar to Hussey, 1 run clipped back down the track, wide of a diving Panesar for another single;

20.5;?;Mahmood to Hussey, no run full and swinging onto off stump. Squirted to gully;
20.4;W;Mahmood to Hayden, OUT there's the breakthrough! And it's that man on the drive who does the trick. Lots of width from Mahmood, Hayden went for a big booming drive and it's a smart reflex take from Jamie Dalrymple at short cover! Not the best ball, but the best result as far as England are concerned;Matthew Hayden c Dalrymple b Mahmood 51 (103m 62b 7x4 1x6) SR: 82.25;
20.4;1w;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 wide short and wild down the leg-side. Symonds flexes some more;
20.3;1;Mahmood to Symonds, 1 run something's not right about Symonds' bicep. I think he's tweaked it playing that last carve over point;

20.1;1;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run too much width, and that's carved down to third man;

5.5;2;Mahmood to Hayden, 2 runs and now leg-sided to the left-hander as well. Too short too, and clipped square;
5.4;3;Mahmood to Clarke, 3 runs too straight, and angling onto the legs, clipped very firmly to deep midwicket, where Panesar fields just inside the rope;

4.4;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run carbon copy of the last two balls. Plunkett's using his height well, and Hayden leaves alone;
4.3;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run good probing stuff. There's some nice trampoline bounce for the seamers outside off stump;
4.2;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run back of a length but straighter and swinging back in. Left alone;
4.1;3;Plunkett to Clarke, 3 runs that's gone fine as well, and Monty Panesar produces a sprawling fumbled stop at fine leg to cut off the boundary. There's no faulting his effort;
3.6;4;Mahmood to Hayden, FOUR runs and that's gone too fine for Read at fine leg to cut off. Another boundary and Hayden's first;
3.5;1;Mahmood to Clarke, 1 run strays in line again;
3.4;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run pushed into the covers;
3.3;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run right back and into line;
3.2;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run left alone. Clarke needs to be watchful;
3.1;1;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run drifts onto the legs, and clipped down to fine leg - where the substitute Chris Read fields! Blimey, we'd forgotten he was still here!;
2.6;4;Plunkett to Clarke, FOUR runs excellently timed off the legs. Panesar at fine leg can't cut that off and that's Australia's first boundary of the innings;
2.5;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run sharp pace, nips away late;
2.4;1lb;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 leg bye drifting down leg, and deflects away for a single;
2.3;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run;
2.2;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run good length - slightly fuller;
2.1;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run good pace and sharp nip off the track. Hayden is squared up and hit in the midriff;
1.6;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run good line and length - left alone to finish a successful over;
1.5;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run;
1.4;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run good discipline;
1.3;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run straighter this time. Pushed back down the pitch;
1.3;1w;Mahmood to Clarke, 1 wide oops, wide and wider;
1.2;W;Mahmood to Hodge, OUT GOTTIM! Well, well, what a start from England! Shorter and straighter, Hodge tried to leave alone but it was onto him too quickly and a big inside-edge deflected onto his middle stump!;Brad Hodge b Mahmood 1 (8m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
1.2;1w;Mahmood to Hodge, 1 wide erratic - started outside off and swung further away;
1.1;?;Mahmood to Hodge, no run full in length, bit of movement, clipped square;
0.6;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run good line, shorter in length, Hayden lets it swing by. Excellent first over;
0.5;1;Plunkett to Hodge, 1 run first runs off the bat, pushed into the covers;
0.5;1w;Plunkett to Hodge, 1 wide that's a harsh call. And Nixon behind the stumps mutters his indignation;
0.5;1w;Plunkett to Hodge, 1 wide too much swing that time, and rightly called wide. But this is encouraging for England;
0.4;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run more handy swing, but started wider this time. Feisty first over so far;
0.3;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run ripper! Late boomeranging movement and that hoops round the edge of the bat. No foot movement there;
0.2;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run signs of swing for Plunkett, though this one is shorter in length and outside off;
0.1;W;Plunkett to Gilchrist, OUT what a start! Brilliant, brilliant delivery from Plunkett. Full, fast, inswinging, perfect yorker length, and Gilchrist has no answer whatsoever! Well, well ... England are on a roll!;Adam Gilchrist b Plunkett 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

Here comes Brad Hodge - his last chance to impress before the World Cup? Probably. What a situation to come into
There's an extra catcher at gully
