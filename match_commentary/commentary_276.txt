Data
So England managed to skittle out the tail but the damage was done in the middle order with Steve Smith making a century after Brad Haddin had begun the counterattack. They've helped Australia up to 326 which is a decent score the way this pitch has played, England nipped out 5 for 97 remember. The tourists will have around 25 minutes to bat before stumps tonight, coming up shortly...

75.1;W;Stokes to Harris, OUT length delivery on off stump and Harris tries to play on the up again but slaps it straight to Anderson at short extra cover.

36.5;3;Rankin to Haddin, 3 runs there's the short ball, and Haddin responds with a pull wide of mid-on...not quite out of the middle and it's flicked back just before the rope. Haddin was waiting for that;

34.6;?;Rankin to Haddin, no run left alone outside off, a reasonably full length and Bairstow took it above his head;
34.5;?;Rankin to Haddin, no run that's sharper from Rankin, more effort, 136kph, nips back from short of a length and clatters into Haddin who is jumping in defence;
34.4;?;Rankin to Haddin, no run short of a length outside off, defended to point;
34.3;2;Rankin to Haddin, 2 runs full at off stump, comes forward to drive and the bat skews in his hand which means he loses some timing;

33.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run we have a review! Is there an inside edge into the pad? Bairstow took it sharply, diving to his right. The initial appeal was for lbw as well. Appears to have beaten the inside edge, and takes the back leg through to the keeper. Yes, it was front pad then back thigh pad. He'll be fine, here;
33.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run nipping back of a good length, beats Haddin on the back foot takes him very close to delicate area;

31.5;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run forward and driven to the left of mid-off;
31.4;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run goes for a drive as this nips into him, his feet don't move and it flies off a thick outside edge down to long leg...Anderson offers some advice;

28.1;W;Broad to Bailey, OUT caught at the second attempt! Oh boy, it looked like Cook had spilled it. Bailey's problems continue.

27.6;?;Anderson to Smith, no run now he makes one go the other way, or hold its line, from back of a length...Smith pulls his bat away but think he'd played first and been beaten;
27.5;?;Anderson to Smith, no run nice delivery, shaping back into Smith as he shoulders arms but the carry makes it easier to leave;
27.4;?;Anderson to Smith, no run more seam movement, nips back at Smith and again he's taken high on the back leg;
27.3;?;Anderson to Smith, no run back of a length, allowing the batsman to hang back, defended to the leg side;
27.2;2;Anderson to Smith, 2 runs angled in towards the hip, Smith works it away fine but Pietersen gets around the boundary to cut it off;
27.1;?;Anderson to Smith, no run shoulders arms to a straight delivery but is saved by the extra bounce from a good length which means he's taken high on the leg;
26.6;?;Broad to Bailey, no run shorter, Bailey stays on the back foot and defends to the off side...nervous times for the No. 6;
26.5;?;Broad to Bailey, no run and another! Perhaps even better. Beaten again outside off stump, and extra bounce this time as Bairstow takes it on the rise;
26.4;?;Broad to Bailey, no run that's a beauty! Nips away from a full length at off stump and beats Bailey who is caught in the crease;

25.4;W;Anderson to Watson, OUT fuller delivery and this nips back to strike the pad right in front of off stump absolutely plumb lbw and England strike right on the stroke of lunch. That's their first leg before dismissal of the entire series! Stone dead that, nipped back to take the big front pad and it would have crashed into middle and leg;Shane Watson lbw b Anderson 43 (93m 59b 7x4 0x6) SR: 72.88;
25.3;?;Anderson to Watson, no run full length, Watson shoulders arms and gets struck on the pad, appeal for lbw, not out given and they decline the review, probably wise, indeed it was according to Hawk Eye;

25.1;?;Anderson to Watson, no run forced off the back foot on the bounce to gully's right who dives and saves well;

24.1;?;Stokes to Smith, no run full length wide enough outside off to leave alone;

 Innings Start
3.10pm, tea So once again England fail miserably with the bat and are trailing by a mile on first-innings. Australia take tea in complete control and can come out after the interval looking once again to run England into the dirt and build up a huge lead. Gnasher back with you in 15 mins...
58.5;W;Johnson to Rankin, OUT full and straight and cleans him up the 91mph delivery does the trick. Full, right at the stumps, tails in a little and beats the inside edge, taking the pad and crashing into middle and leg stumps, Johnson does his job;Boyd Rankin b Johnson 13 (22m 22b 2x4 0x6) SR: 59.09;

57.4;?;Lyon to Rankin, no run left alone outside off stump;
57.3;4;Lyon to Rankin, FOUR runs clubbed from just outside off over mid-on and brings the 150 up, reasonable strike that;

52.6;W;Harris to Borthwick, OUT straightens the line and gets Borthwick to drive, a touch loose, he gets a thick outside edge to Smith at third slip, solid catch down low.

51.4;?;Lyon to Broad, no run touch short and cut to short cover off a bottom edge;
51.3;4;Lyon to Broad, FOUR runs goes again, this time on the sweep over midwicket, not quite as nicely timed and it just reaches the rope on a couple of bounces;

49.1;?;Lyon to Borthwick, no run forward with hard hands and almost pops up a catch to short leg;
48.6;W;Siddle to Stokes, OUT leaves a straight one alone and is clean bowled simply a poor piece of judgement and an unusual decision from someone so keen to put bat to ball. Just a terrible leave, middle stump line and it crashes into the top of middle and off stumps, might have come back a little but the initial line was far too straight to consider leaving. A shame for Stokes who had played well;Ben Stokes b Siddle 47 (141m 101b 4x4 0x6) SR: 46.53;

48.1;W;Siddle to Bairstow, OUT length ball, pushed forward at and pops it up to silly mid-on Bairstow falling into the trap. He went hard a length ball to do no more than just knock it up the wicket, pretty unnecessary really, the ball wasn't there to drive but Bairstow has chipped a catch low to the fielder just off the wicket on the leg side. The delivery might just have gone through the top of the surface and bounced a little;Jonny Bairstow c Bailey b Siddle 18 (69m 50b 1x4 0x6) SR: 36;
47.6;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run touch tighter line and blocked up on the off side coming forward;

44.6;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run through to Haddin to end a maiden;

41.5;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run defended on the back foot;
41.4;1;Lyon to Bairstow, 1 run that's drilled back towards Lyon as he comes down the pitch, technically a chance low to his right. In a way, surprised it didn't stick given Australia's series;
41.3;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run left alone;
41.2;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run close! This one jumps at Bairstow, spin and bounce, and takes him in the chest to fly wide of short. Actually no glove involved;
41.1;1lb;Lyon to Stokes, 1 leg bye big appeal for lbw, Stokes was coming forward so maybe outside off stump but Clarke goes for a review. It did drift in from Lyon. Well, it's close. Don't think he hit it. The stride wasn't as big as it looked first up. Yes, it's outside off stump;
40.6;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run short of a length, driven from the back foot to mid-off;
40.5;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run left alone outside off;

39.5;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run nice bounce outside off, left alone;
39.4;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run sweeps again and this time there's no single as it zips to Siddle who is much closer at square leg;
39.3;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run full on middle, blocked;

37.2;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run fuller and brings the drive which finds short cover;

36.4;?;Johnson to Bairstow, no run full outside off, left alone;
36.3;?;Johnson to Bairstow, no run fuller at off stump, defended to mid-off...Bairstow played that from outside leg stump;

35.6;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run stays round the wicket, pushed outside off stump and left alone...a few yelps from the close fielders, all part of adding to the pressure;

34.5;?;Johnson to Bairstow, no run tries to get himself across the crease, the ball is fuller and he leaves alone;
34.4;?;Johnson to Bairstow, no run flashing again, beaten again...no footwork and playing away from his body at a short-of-a-length delivery;
34.3;?;Johnson to Bairstow, no run he's played at this one and been beaten, on a length outside off and he was feeling for it, perhaps expecting swing back into him;

34.1;?;Johnson to Bairstow, no run pushed across full outside off, left alone;

32.3;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run he's crunched the foot of another England batsman...slower-ball yorker, but still causing some pain, strikes Stokes on the full but it's missing leg stump. Stokes hobbling.;
32.2;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run defended firmly into the pitch and Johnson jumps to take it one-handed to the excitement of the crowd...we aren't quite playing one hand, one bounce;
32.1;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run full outside off, 143kph, left alone;
31.6;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run stays round the wicket to the right hander, some bounce again as Bairstow just prods at a defensive shot;
31.5;W;Lyon to Ballance, OUT done it! Terrific delivery from Lyon, spin and bounce around off stump, Ballance lunging forward and it's a thin edge to give Haddin another catch. Classical off-spin bowling.;Gary Ballance c ?Haddin b Lyon 18 (93m 51b 2x4 0x6) SR: 35.29;

28.3;?;Johnson to Ballance, no run short ball and Ballance doesn't read it right and takes a whack right on the helmet, went to duck at the last minute but couldn't and rather bobbed his head into the ball, nasty moment, needs a change of lid;

23.3;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run left alone comfortably outside off;
23.2;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run firm back foot punch to extra cover, better version of the shot that nearly got him out the ball before;
23.1;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run this nips back a little and I think takes the inside edge as Haddin goes to his right to take the catch, muted celebrations from the Australians because they are not sure whether it was an edge or indeed if it carried behind. The umpires are checking upstairs, there's a definite edge but I'm not sure the third umpire can be sure this carried and not out is given;

17.5;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run left alone outside off;
17.4;W;Siddle to Bell, OUT the demise continues! On a length outside off, perhaps just nips away a touch - well, didn't do much - Bell feeling for it without any footwork and a thin edge is snaffled by Haddin;Ian Bell c ?Haddin b Siddle 2 (56m 32b 0x4 0x6) SR: 6.25;
17.3;?;Siddle to Bell, no run full on off stump, Bell not getting much of a stride this time and it runs off the thick outside edge to gully;

12.3;?;Harris to Ballance, no run gets taken on the pad first ball, but it pitched outside leg stump;
12.2;W;Harris to Pietersen, OUT and another! Watson catches this one, but only with another juggle. Pietersen driving at a length delivery, his feet didn't really move, the bottom hand comes off the bat and it goes at chest height to first slip;Kevin Pietersen c Watson b Harris 3 (12m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
12.1;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run not convincing as he drives at a full delivery and it skews off an outside edge to point;
11.6;?;Johnson to Bell, no run full outside off, left alone...a ball of relative calmness;
11.5;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run short of a length, defended into the off side who races for a quick single and has to dive to make sure he beats Warner's throw. That would have been close with a hit. Warner is so quick.;

10.3;?;Harris to Bell, no run full on off stump, gets forward and defends;
10.2;?;Harris to Bell, no run this is close! Huge appeal for lbw, Bell playing across a ball, beaten by some seam movement. And Clarke reviews. Oh, perhaps just sliding down the leg side. Might just be clipping leg. In fact, it's missing completely;
10.1;?;Harris to Bell, no run forward to a full delivery outside off, a little movement away, defended to backward point;
9.6;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run well bowled, full again at middle, 145kph, defended back up the pitch;
9.5;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run gets a full delivery first ball, searching for the swing, Pietersen is a little static in the crease but keeps it out safely enough;
9.4;W;Johnson to Anderson, OUT and that's that for Anderson.

9.3;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run excellent bowling, full outside off, no footwork and he's beaten as he drives;
9.2;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run short and wide, he chases it with a square cut but is beaten for pace;
9.1;4;Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs this is short, at the ribs, Anderson plays and it almost comes off the back of the bat then flies over the slips;
8.6;1;Harris to Anderson, 1 run flicked off his hip, this time it isn't fielded cleanly by Lyon around the corner but Anderson may wish it had been as he's now on strike to Johnson;
8.5;?;Harris to Anderson, no run more steepling bounce outside off, short of a length but not a full-on bouncer and Anderson actually plays it pretty well as he drops his hands at the last moment;
8.4;?;Harris to Anderson, no run fuller on off stump, Anderson understandably hanging back as he defends to the off side;
8.3;?;Harris to Anderson, no run shoots down the leg side;
8.2;?;Harris to Anderson, no run now he fends one just wide of Bailey a short leg, short on leg stump and he's pushing hard and it;
8.1;?;Harris to Anderson, no run that's well played, stands tall and defends a short-of-a-length delivery to point...desperate for a single, who can blame him, but he is sent back;
7.6;?;Johnson to Bell, no run fuller outside off, left alone...lively star from Johnson;
7.5;?;Johnson to Bell, no run short, quick, 147kph, slightly down the leg side and Bell ducks under the line;

7.3;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run angled into the pads, 145kph, flicked off his legs but Lyon makes an excellent stop at leg gully where he caught Carberry last night;
7.2;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run full this time, Anderson rooted to the crease and he drives getting a think inside edge into his pads;
7.1;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run almost strikes first ball, short of a length and it bounces at Anderson who fends it off a leading edge close to the man at short cover;
6.6;?;Harris to Bell, no run a leading edge! Sorry for overload of exclamation marks, but what an over. Full, straightening a touch on Bell who shapes to play to the leg side and ball lands in front of mid-on. Jeepers.;
6.5;?;Harris to Bell, no run finds the middle of the bat, a minor victory for Bell, it's back of a length on off stump and defended;
6.4;?;Harris to Bell, no run now he's beaten! Harris all over England, who look clueless. It's another good delivery, 143kph, and Bell is pushing forward then the ball skids past the outside edge;
6.3;?;Harris to Bell, no run dropped! He should have been two-in-two. Perfect line on off stump, making Bell play and the outside edge his shelled by Watson at first slip!;
6.2;W;Harris to Cook, OUT would you believe it! Cook has just padded up to one which would have taken off stump. Don't think the ball really did that much, it was just straight and held its line. Yet Cook just thrust his pad forward and a few seconds later Aleem Dar's finger went up;Alastair Cook lbw b Harris 7 (28m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 36.84;

5.3;?;Johnson to Cook, no run length delivery on off stump, Cook from the crease nudges it towards point;

3.2;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run good length and beats Carberry outside off, just wobbled enough to beat the outside edge, in fact, there's a mark on Hot Spot! There was no appeal at all;

16.1;?;Stokes to Rogers, no run good length on off stump, Rogers forward playing up on the off side;
15.6;W;Broad to Clarke, OUT now Broad strikes! Loose from Clarke, perhaps thinking about the previous ball which caused some pain. He feels for a short, wider ball and offers a thin edge to the keeper;Michael Clarke c ?Bairstow b Broad 6 (25m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
15.5;?;Broad to Clarke, no run extra bounce from short of a length, Clarke whips his bottom hand off the bat as he defends;

 Innings Start
There goes another Ashes series and Australia have regained the Urn and in some style. A 5-0 hammering, every Test a complete stuffing with England never properly in the contest. Where do we go from here? Well Australia go to South Africa in February and that will surely be a much tougher series. England have some time off before their home season begins in May and Sri Lanka come to the UK. But there is, of course, a five-match one-day series and three T20s to complete this current tour - the teams will be much-changed when the matches get underway next Sunday, January 12, at the MCG. Do join us then but for the time being, from Gnasher and I, it's goodbye from Sydney.

Mark Taylor has taken over the presentation, presumably Mark Nicholas couldn't stomach it. Medals come first, with the umpires collecting a
"gift" from Shane Warne. Starbucks voucher perhaps? Man of the Match is awarded to Ryan Harris for his eight wickets in the match, richly deserved I think, he has been outstanding since coming back for Australia in the second Test at Lord's, not least in managing to stay fit.

And now the Compton-Miller medal for Man of the Series, a toss up between Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson. There's an X Factor-style delay and...it goes to Johnson for 37 wickets at 14! What a comeback from Johnson, a tearaway fast bowler who couldn't keep it on the cut strip but now he's back as one of the leading quicks in the world. He terrorised England in this series, especially in the first two Tests, especially at Adelaide with that incredible spell in the first innings.

Alastair Cook. I feel for you sir, what can he possibly say: "It's obviously tough knowing that you've been beaten badly in five games. We weren't good enough to turn it around. We tried to change the way we played but anything we through at Australia they were good enough. When you hit rock bottom the only way is up. Things turned around in 2007. We know we have a huge amount of talent in England and we have to look about where we go from here."

a slightly emotional Michael Clarke: "It's an extremely special occasion. We couldn't foresee 5-0 after the England series but I said then the work we were putting in behind the scenes we were going to get the rewards. The bowlers have done a fantastic job, I told them before the Test that they were the best attack in the world and I think they've earned that mantle." Clarke gets his hands on the Waterford Crystal Ashes and the Australians come up to get their hands back on the Urn for the first time since 2007. Most congratulations to them.

The Australians, draped in Blue Ensigns, are taking a lap of honour and don't they deserve it, what an achievement they have managed in the past two months. Incredible really. This is not a truly great Australian side like the 2006-07 crop were - and England competed far better in that series - but the captain and coach (and physiotherapists) have eked everything they could find out of this group of players. Presentation coming up shortly...

England, well, go home and hang your heads in shame. It has been a pathetic performance from them. They were okay with the ball but the batting has just been the stuff of schoolboys. No discipline, no fight, no commitment, no pride it seems in playing for England. They have rolled over so meakly that it will take something for several of these cricketers to recover. This final defeat has confirmed, surely, that they are the worst touring party ever to leave England. 155 all out and 166 all out here, and it's not just the totals they have managed but the lack of time they have kept Australia out in the field. But, hey ho, it's only a game and the McGrath Foundation day here keeps things in perspective. The SCG pretty in pink and the home side have put on a grand day.

What a remarkable achievement by Michael Clarke's side. Having been comprehensively beaten in England just four months ago they have became just the third side in the 140-year history of the game to complete an Ashes whitewash. No-one saw this coming at all but Clarke's team have found a way to fire and have performed consistently over five Tests. A three-day win here the icing on the cake and reward for the remarkable turnaround they have conjured.

Well, well, well, just 31.4 overs this second innings has lasted and Australia have blazed England away, this latest victory by a whopping 281 runs and Australia complete a 5-0 Ashes whitewash. The juggernaut revved up after tea and Ryan Harris, Mitchell Johnson and Nathan Lyon have steamrollered England into surely the greatest embarrassment in their history. The tourists' fond memories of three years ago have been totally eradicated here with an utter annihilation.

31.4;W;Harris to Rankin, OUT outside edge gone!! Taken at second slip at head height and that's the wicket that seals it. A full delivery just outside off, Rankin swung hard at it, got a thick outside edge and it was taken well by Clarke;Boyd Rankin c Clarke b Harris 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
31.3;?;Harris to Rankin, no run bumper and Rankin gets under it;
31.2;W;Harris to Broad, OUT full and straight, Broad swings rather wildly from no position whatsoever and is clean bowled with leg stump being knocked back. Going for another big one was Broad and he missed completely;Stuart Broad b Harris 42 (36m 36b 3x4 4x6) SR: 116.66;
31.1;6;Harris to Broad, SIX runs short and pulled and six more! Broad clears long leg into the pavilion this time;

29.1;W;Harris to Stokes, OUT a step down the track, tries to slap a length ball to leg and drags it onto his stumps. Stokes going down fighting, a bit stroke too many and got a bottom-edge into the base of middle stump. He was aiming leg side and it ended up being a bit of an ugly head-in-the-air slap but a little cameo was at least something for England;Ben Stokes b Harris 32 (38m 16b 3x4 2x6) SR: 200;
28.6;6;Lyon to Broad, SIX runs slog swept and that is a huge shot into the stands over midwicket, right off the meat taken from off stump;

27.6;1;Johnson to Broad, 1 run chipped in the air past leg gully down to long leg;

25.4;?;Johnson to Broad, no run slower ball, 81mph, just outside off, Broad goes to drive and misses;

25.2;?;Johnson to Broad, no run pushed off the back foot into the covers;
25.1;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run tucked to leg from the crease in front of square;
24.6;?;Lyon to Broad, no run forward, covering up around off stump;
24.5;?;Lyon to Broad, no run goes again and misses, good job for Broad it bounced over off stump;
24.4;4;Lyon to Broad, FOUR runs swept strongly off the stumps and finds the square leg fence, good timing;
24.3;?;Lyon to Broad, no run forward and plays at this outside off, pushing forward and getting beaten;
24.2;?;Lyon to Broad, no run floated up outside off, left alone;
24.1;1;Lyon to Stokes, 1 run slog swept off a top edge and lucky he got it so poorly off the bat because it lands well in front of the deep-square running in;
23.6;?;Johnson to Broad, no run yorker length outside off and Broad digs it out into the gully;
23.5;?;Johnson to Broad, no run leg side again, well away from Broad;

23.1;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run full on the stumps and firmly pushed into the covers for a quick single;
22.6;W;Lyon to Borthwick, OUT around the wicket onto leg stump, it bits and takes the outside edge and Clarke dives to take the catch at first slip! A lovely bit of bowling, tossed up and it bounced and turned again and as Borthwick looked to turn it to leg he got a thick outside edge that Clarke claimed with a wonderful dive to his left, inches above the turf that was taken;Scott Borthwick c Clarke b Lyon 4 (2m 2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200;
22.5;4;Lyon to Borthwick, FOUR runs nice punching stroke to a ball a little short outside off and he finds the extra cover rope;
22.4;W;Lyon to Bairstow, OUT but this is off pad after inside edge and Bairstow is caught at short leg a bit of bounce and turn and a sharp catch from George Bailey under the lid reaching up with two hands over his right shoulder;Jonny Bairstow c Bailey b Lyon 0 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

22.1;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run blocked on the back foot around off stump;
21.6;?;Johnson to Bairstow, no run back of a length at middle and leg and Bairstow nearly tucks it to leg gully, it lands a yard short of him;
21.5;W;Johnson to Ballance, OUT full length it keeps low and skips under Ballance's defensive stroke, trapping him in front of off stump. Again the pace of Johnson forces and error, Ballance caught on the crease but it need keep low which totally did for him, front pad, right in front of the timbers;Gary Ballance lbw b Johnson 7 (35m 27b 1x4 0x6) SR: 25.92;

21.3;3;Johnson to Stokes, 3 runs same length, at the body and tucked through midwicket;
21.2;W;Johnson to Carberry, OUT back of a length again but a wider line that entices Carberry to cut and he nicks off to Haddin a thick top edge easily collected at head height. The extra pace of Johnson hurrying the batsman who didn't get into the perfect position for the strike and nicked off;Michael Carberry c ?Haddin b Johnson 43 (95m 63b 8x4 0x6) SR: 68.25;
21.1;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run back of a length on off stump, blocked in the crease;
20.6;?;Lyon to Ballance, no run beaten with the last ball of the session, more sharp spin from around off stump, but he survives;
20.5;?;Lyon to Ballance, no run hits quite high on the bat as he pushes forward, nearly lobs to silly point;
20.4;4;Lyon to Ballance, FOUR runs nicely played, gets well forward, over the top of the ball to cover for any spin and drives it through the covers;

20.2;?;Lyon to Ballance, no run forward and defended to silly point;

19.5;?;Johnson to Ballance, no run full outside off, pushed to the right of mid-off;
19.4;?;Johnson to Ballance, no run that's a good bouncer, 141kph, and Ballance is hopping around his crease to avoid it;
19.3;2lb;Johnson to Ballance, 2 leg byes short at the body, flicks it fine past Haddin, wasn't far away from being close enough for a dive, but it came off his chest anyway;
19.2;1;Johnson to Carberry, 1 run full on leg stump, flicked out to deep square leg;
19.1;4;Johnson to Carberry, FOUR runs another boundary, more fortune this time as he flashes at a shorter, wider delivery and gets a healthy top edge over the slips;
19.1;5nb;Johnson to Carberry, (no ball) FOUR runs gets dispatched first ball, pitched up on off stump and Carberry drills it through mid-off;
18.6;?;Lyon to Ballance, no run lovely bowling, that's beautiful as he tosses it up around middle and rips it past the outside edge;

15.5;?;Harris to Ballance, no run left alone outside off;
15.4;?;Harris to Ballance, no run another appeal for an lbw and a catch, this nips back into Ballance and takes the pad then carries to gully...lovely shape, close for the lbw. He wasn't very far forward;

15.2;?;Harris to Ballance, no run gets nicely forward to a fuller delivery outside off, driven towards short cover;
15.1;?;Harris to Ballance, no run back of a length on off stump, appears to bounce a bit more than Ballance expected and he plays an unconvincing prod;
14.6;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run spins past the outside edge again, an excellent first over from Lyon;
14.5;2;Lyon to Carberry, 2 runs gets lucky! Using his feet, aims to loft it over the leg side and gets a thick leading edge which loops into space on the off side;
14.4;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run slightly shorter, Carberry goes back and cuts to cover;
14.3;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run puts his bat behind his pad as he comes forward, this spins through to Haddin;
14.2;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run fuller, a tough wider, left alone...nice flight;
14.1;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run massive appeal for caught behind! Sharp spin from around middle stump, Carberry trying to pull his bat inside the line. Erasmus says not out. Haddin is convinced there's an edge and eventually Clarke reviews. Nothing showing on Hot Spot and no movement on Snicko, so this will stay as not-out;
13.6;?;Harris to Ballance, no run a flat-footed drive, the bat turns in his hand and the ball runs to leg side;
13.5;?;Harris to Ballance, no run keeps it full at off stump, defended to mid-on again;
13.4;?;Harris to Ballance, no run full on off stump, driven to mid-on;
13.3;W;Harris to Pietersen, OUT what a catch! Australia can do no wrong. Think inside edge as he tries to come forward, it nipped back a touch, the ball bounced high off his pad and Bailey did brilliant to fling himself backwards and catch it behind him over his shoulder;Kevin Pietersen c Bailey b Harris 6 (20m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60;
13.2;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run full at off stump, whipped to mid-on;
13.1;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run almost loses control of this time, reaching in front of his body and his bottom hand comes off the bat;
12.6;4;Siddle to Carberry, FOUR runs that's a strong cover drive, good stride into the full delivery and slots it wide of mid-off;
12.5;2;Siddle to Carberry, 2 runs picks up a couple behind square on the leg side from a defensive shot;
12.4;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run beats him with a full delivery outside off, continued to come in with the angle from round the wicket;
12.3;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run plays this late, defended to backward point;
12.2;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run first ball with a new bat and it takes the outside edge but doesn't carry to second slip...was short of a length from round the wicket, on off stump, forcing Carberry to play;
12.1;3;Siddle to Pietersen, 3 runs full on middle, flicked through midwicket;
11.6;?;Harris to Carberry, no run he's broken his bat! It's snapped in half...just a defensive shot to a length ball and he's left with two pieces of bat in his hand. Symbolic of the series. A few smiles. Harris will be telling Mitchell that he's the one to break a bat;
11.5;?;Harris to Carberry, no run full at off stump, a punchy on-drive but he can't beat the diving mid-on;
11.4;?;Harris to Carberry, no run flash and a miss outside off, trying to drive a wide delivery but it wasn't really full enough for the shot;

10.6;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run pulls his bat inside the line of a shorter delivery;
10.5;4;Siddle to Carberry, FOUR runs in the air! But straight of mid-off, gets away with it. Driving at a full delivery, didn't seem to try and keep it down - perhaps the ball stopped a little - but mid-off was quite square;
10.4;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run short of a length, behind the line and defended to cover;
10.3;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run another booming drive, loses his shape a little and it bobbles into the leg side;
10.2;4;Siddle to Carberry, FOUR runs brings him into the drive this time, was closer to off stump, not entirely in control as it comes off a thick outside and goes in the air through backward point but evades the catches...Warner chases and tries to flick it back, but drags the ball into the boundary;
10.1;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run round the wicket, hanging it full outside off, left alone;
9.6;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run full outside off, Pietersen trying to leave it alone but is late withdrawing his bat and it comes off a toe end towards third slip;
9.5;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run left alone outside off, nice shape away from the batsman;
9.4;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run back of a length on off stump, pushed into the off side;
9.3;W;Harris to Bell, OUT sharp catch! Two down. Bell trying to be positive, saw a hint of width from Harris but couldn't keep his back-cut down and he picked out gully who took it low down;Ian Bell c Warner b Harris 16 (33m 19b 1x4 1x6) SR: 84.21;

8.1;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run around the wicket, two feet outside off, left alone;
7.6;6;Johnson to Bell, SIX runs short ball sliding across the off stump, Bell uppercuts, there is a third man in place but this clears him into the stand, aggressive from Bell;
7.5;?;Johnson to Bell, no run full on the stumps, blocked into the covers;
7.4;?;Johnson to Bell, no run fuller length on a similar line, left alone;
7.3;4;Johnson to Bell, FOUR runs drops the length and allows Bell to punch through point, decent stroke;
