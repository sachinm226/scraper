Data
Not a bad score but Pakistan would have been comfortable with so much more in this crucial game. The early wickets dented their plans and as a result at the end of ten overs they progressed at ODI pace, 5.5 an over and thereabouts. Jamshed provided the acceleration and Kamran Akmal gave him good support but Pakistan needed some big overs towards the end ideally. They should have put away some of those full tosses. Watson got away with a few.
If Pakistan can sneak in a few early wickets and expose the middle order, we will have a cracker. Join us shortly.

Xavier Doherty to open the bowling
Players are walking out for the anthem.
Zia: "Please leave Afridi down the order, he should be 8th, possibly even 9th with the way Gul has batted recently. Come on Pak lets get a massive total!"
Kamran: "Looks like a defensive decision by Aussies. Probably, they are thinking to keep the advantage of Run Rate with them, probably scared of rain and D/L and probably trying not to expose their untested middle order in the last match before knock out. In hindsight, they have given the best chance to Pakistan to come back into the tournament by playing to their strength that is defending a target. A couple of wickets at the top in the Aussie run chase and it will be an inexperienced middle order of Australia against arguably the best bowling attack of the tournament, though, that bowling attack has been seriously out of form till now. Probably, this is the trigger they needed badly and what a time to get that opportunity. "
Toss: George Bailey has won the toss and Australia will bowl first. They are playing an unchanged team. Hafeez said he too would have bowled first. He says a target of 150 plus on this pitch will be tough to chase.
One change for Pakistan - Arafat makes way for Abdul Razzaq.
Message is straightforward for Pakistan - score as much as possible for the sake of the NRR.
Take a look at ESPNcricinfo's Twenty20 performance analysis. Kevin Pietersen and Ajantha Mendis are the leading batsman and bowler in Twenty20 internationals.
Sajjad: "Pakistan can do something very serious, remember the semi final match in 2010 t20. Australia bowling was really tough and Pakistan went on to make 191 against that bowling line up." Then came Hussey...
Gareth: "Smart move to bowl first. That way, if the target is small enough, they can experiment with the batting line up, and give White/Bailey/Wade/Maxwell a hit, otherwise they can go unchanged if the heat is on. No matter what, Australia will look to win this comfortably, to take some momentum into the semis."
Quite a few of you are in agreement with Wajih on this: "Excellent change this, bringing in Razzaq for Arafat. Or so I believe based on resources available to Pakistan."
2.40pm: Good day everyone and welcome to Permutations Day at the World T20. Two matches on Tuesday and semi-final spots yet to be filled from Group 2. First up is Australia v Pakistan, and a very very important game for the latter. The 2009 champions are having to sweat it out to reach the final four. If only they hadn't lost so badly to India.
South Africa, who are playing later today, will be keeping an eye on the events. Should Pakistan beat Australia, South Africa will bow out and they'll be playing for pride against India. Should Pakistan lose, and South Africa win, we will have three teams tied on 2 points and it will come down to Net Run Rate. That will be an interesting scenario.
If Pakistan lose to Australia, an Indian win will knock them out without NRR playing any part. Even if South Africa beat India in this scenario, Pakistan's chances remain bleak: if they lose their match by five runs (chasing 161), and if South Africa score 160 and beat India by the same margin, then Pakistan's NRR will be poorer than South Africa's. More on the scenarios in this piece by S Rajesh.
Australia though don't have too many worries. They are all but through to the semis. They will have to get butchered today to miss a spot in the final four. In current form, that looks unlikely. The two Ws - Warner and Watson - have done most of the work. Will George Bailey have a bat?
 Innings Start
Presentation:
Bailey: "Pakistan outplayed us. The ball turned more, they used spin against us well. You want your top order to do the majority of the scoring. The challenge will be to get that form back in the semis."
Hafeez: "I'm grateful to see the effort put in by the boys. We got the total we wanted, Raza Hasan was brilliant."
Raza Hasan is the Man of the Match: "I'm really happy at the moment as it's my first big tournament. Everybody gives me confidence. Ee knew we had to try hard."
Pakistan will now be glued to the TV for the second match. India will need to win comprehensively to keep their hopes alive. Not over yet.
The commentary for the second game has started. Thanks for your company here. We will end with this cracker from Sundar: "The problem is, even if India do manage to get to the SF, they will end up playing SL. All those who want an Ind-SL SF, please raise your hands."
End of match: Australia are through to the semi-finals despite a big defeat. A big thumbs-up to Pakistan for the way they took them on in the field. They should be proud of this bowling effort after the disappointment against India. Pakistan played to their strengths - spin - and didn't bring on pace till the 18th over. By then, Australia's chase was already derailed, but 112 was within reach. That their middle order was tested shake off any complacency that may have set in. We saw that happening to WI when Gayle fell early.
South Africa will now play for pride. What's at stake for India? S Rajesh tweets: "If India score 160, they need to win by 32 runs; if they score 140, the margin needs to be at least 31."
