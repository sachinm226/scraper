Data
Hayden's good innings has carried Australia to 346. He was sluggish, had a couple close calls in the field, but smoked some super dingers and has batted all through the innings, despite injury to the foot, to take his side to a very competitive total. I was going to add another 'very' in there but then we've seen, in this series and last year's version, how New Zealand have chased down totals close to this. I will reiterate again just how easy it is to clear the ropes on the grounds we've seen in New Zealand. I'm not picking a favorite just yet, but I will put my money down on the world-record 26 sixes falling in this match. Just another 11 will break that.
Do join me again at around 18:30 local, 05:30 GMT for New Zealand's chase and Australia's attempt at avoiding a whitewash...or is it blackwash? I'll be back with all the action.

 Innings Start
I need a breather and a nice stiff drink. Wow. If you thought the last match was a humdinger, well I'll tell you, this was something else. Bracken just lost the plot in the last over, offering a bleeding full toss to McCullum, a man whose reputation as a last-ditch scrapper has skyrocketed. What an innings he played, an unbeaten 86 from 91 deliveries, partnering the never-say-die McMillan in the partnership of the match.
McMillan....well, he needs a special mention. From 41 for 4, with the solid Peter Fulton for support to begin with, he slammed the fastest ODI hundred by a New Zealander. He showed his belligerence in the CB Series and in the last match, but today he took it up a notch and then some. A fabulous innings from him, a day he wont forget any time soon. McMillan, Fulton, McCullum and that man Mark Gillespie, who kept everyone on their toes with a 15-ball 28, mastering the art of the inside-edge and french cut to perfection.
Spare a though for Mike Hussey, who hasnt won a game as captain. He had a depleted side, but then like they say, you put your best team forward. New Zealand too were without their two best bowlers, Shane Bond and Daniel Vettori, and it showed as Matthew Hayden led a fine onslaught to carry Australia to 346. He carried his bat, and braved a fractured foot to score an unbeaten 181, the highest score by an Australian. Unfortunately, he didnt take the field and ended up on the losing side. His injury will monitored very closely leading into the World Cup in three weeks.
For those interested in stats, today's match had 26 sixes - yes, 26 - to equal the record set during that 438 match at Johannesburg last year.
So New Zealand sweep the 2006-07 Chappell-Hadlee Series.
Well, thats all we have for you. This was the last official ODI ahead of that little tournament the ICC have lined up next month. We will definitely see you there. This is Jamie Alter signing off with a hearty cheers until the World Cup!
