Data
What a final over from Bailey and has taken Australia from what was only a par score to a very good total, England would not have been expecting to chase above 190 when they took a flurry of wickets to reduce Australia to 139 for 6 with four overs to go. But Bailey's blinder puts Australia in the box seat for another win and Monty will be back with the final innings of this tour shortly...
19.6;2;Dernbach to Bailey, 2 runs full and wide, Bailey has to almost dive across for it, gets a thick outside edge to third man, Wright saves with super dive and throws back to Buttler who manages to miss the stumps with a flick of the hands meaning Bailey got back for the second;

13.2;W;Root to Cutting, OUT down the track, punches firmly back towards the bowler but Root reaches out to his left and clings onto a rifling chance that was struck very well but evidently too straight and Root intervened to perfect effect;Ben Cutting c & b Root 29 (22m 16b 1x4 3x6) SR: 181.25;

11.4;4;Dernbach to Cutting, FOUR runs full length swung hard down the ground, Root sliding to his left at long-on misses, perhaps could have done better there;
11.3;?;Dernbach to Cutting, no run excellent quick yorker and Cutting is hurried into digging out the toe-crusher;

9.5;1;Dernbach to Cutting, 1 run length ball outside the line of off, opens the face and guides one to third man;

8.6;6;Broad to Cutting, SIX runs launches into a length ball and sends it high, high, high and just beyond the boundary at long-on. Told you;
8.5;?;Broad to Cutting, no run tries to dab the ball to the same part of the ground and it's cut off on the edge of the ring, Lumb the substitute, he has a shy with Cutting stranded but fails to hit!;
8.4;2;Broad to Cutting, 2 runs goes back and runs a couple down to third man;
8.3;1;Broad to White, 1 run leg-stump line, closes the face and works one to backward square leg;
8.2;W;Broad to Maxwell, OUT swings again but Maxwell has holed out to long-on!

6.4;W;Bresnan to Finch, OUT on the attack, doesn't get hold of a pull and plops the ball to mid-on! England have got their aggressor, Bresnan winkles him out with a half-tracker, miscalculation from Finch, who tried to pull from outside off, maybe wasn't quite short enough either and spooned to the fielder;Aaron Finch c Broad b Bresnan 30 (29m 21b 1x4 3x6) SR: 142.85;
6.3;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run on the stumps, played respectfully back this time;
6.2;6;Bresnan to Finch, SIX runs here goes Finch again - he loves playing against England - carting a slightly fill ball out towards wide long-on, Hales gets round to it but appeared uncertain where the boundary was and compounds his drop but sending it beyond the rope. Tough but takeable;
6.1;1;Bresnan to White, 1 run length outside off, White attacks but can't replicate Finch's hitting, skewing a thick edge to third man on the bounce;
5.6;?;Stokes to Finch, no run shortens his length wisely, outside off, guides the ball straight to short third man;
5.5;6;Stokes to Finch, SIX runs six more, into the crowd at long-on! Overptiched from Stokes and he's taken downtown by the little big man again, crrrrrrrrrrrrunched back over his head;
5.4;?;Stokes to Finch, no run good pace, around off stump, Finch has a big old ballyhoo and fails to connect;
5.3;2;Stokes to Finch, 2 runs on leg stump, worked through square leg for a couple more;
5.2;6;Stokes to Finch, SIX runs clubbed over deep backward square, that's a monstrous flick from Finch, the first six of the innings! He came forward out of the crease, made the delivery a half-volley on his pads, but the nonchalance with which he launched the ball over the rope was astounding;
5.1;?;Stokes to Finch, no run starts well, length ball on off stump, tapped into the off side;
4.6;1;Bresnan to Finch, 1 run opens the face and runs a single to short third man;
4.5;1;Bresnan to White, 1 run tight line outside off from Bresnan, an inside edge bobbles short on the off side and they get one;
4.4;?;Bresnan to White, no run on the stumps, worked back on the leg side, Jordan scampers in to field;
4.3;?;Bresnan to White, no run seams back a touch and cramps Whites for room, hitting him near the bread basket;

4.1;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run good length on the stumps, blocked watchfully;
3.6;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run full, attempted yorker, nearly catches Finch out, he swipes an inside edge to deep square leg;
3.5;1lb;Jordan to White, 1 leg bye fires the ball in full at White's feet as he wanders to leg, deflects away square;
3.4;?;Jordan to White, no run down the leg side, there's a scrape of something - most likely pad - and Buttler then takes a terrific low catch diving to his left. Saved a leg bye, he did;
3.3;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run short and at the batsman, pulled flat through midwicket, there's a fielder out there now;
3.2;?;Jordan to Finch, no run this was slightly more ungainly (less gainly?), as Finch makes room and swings wildly at a short ball that bounces over the stumps;
3.1;4;Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs Jordan tries the chin music on Finch, whose swats it away at chest height, loopy pull shot but it bounces away to the rope;
2.6;?;Broad to White, no run ripper from Broad, beats the batsman for pace as the ball zips through off the pitch;
2.5;1;Broad to Finch, 1 run punches a length ball down the ground, just one as mid-on and mid-off converge;
2.4;1;Broad to White, 1 run length in the channel, stays back and opens the face to run one to third man;
2.3;4;Broad to White, FOUR runs goes again, this time on the pull, Broad dropping short and being carted high over midwicket - he's up and running now;
2.2;4;Broad to White, FOUR runs you beauty! That's a shot from White, driven crisply, furiously even, on the up and straight back past Broad for the first boundary. Wasn't overpitched but took some punishment;
2.1;?;Broad to White, no run length ball, tight line around off, tapped short on the off side;
1.6;?;Jordan to Finch, no run Finch backs away and Jordan follows him, sends a length ball zipping through past a swing and a miss - decent first over from Jordan;
1.5;?;Jordan to Finch, no run length ball, nips back a touch and rattles into the pads, might have been some bat involved, height an issue too;
1.4;1;Jordan to White, 1 run digs this in short and White takes it on, pulling aerially down towards Dernbach, who can't make up the ground and settles for making a goalie stop on the bounce;
1.3;2;Jordan to White, 2 runs on the stumps and flicked behind square this time, Dernbach makes a bit of a meal of stopping it at fine leg;
1.2;?;Jordan to White, no run angled in, slightly full again, clipped firmly to leg where Bresnan makes a diving stop at midwicket;
1.1;?;Jordan to White, no run pitched up, wide enough to get White's dander up, but he miscues and thick inside edge into his pads;
1.1;1w;Jordan to White, 1 wide and he starts with a wide, firing this narrowly down the leg side;
0.6;?;Broad to Finch, no run good length, outside the line and Finch guides it into the covers;
0.5;1;Broad to White, 1 run on the stumps, worked off the legs through square;
0.4;1;Broad to Finch, 1 run on the stumps, worked back past the bowler, mid-on moves across to his left;
0.3;1;Broad to White, 1 run cross-seam delivery from Broad, Finch pushes it on the full wide of short extra cover for a single;
0.2;?;Broad to White, no run shortish, touch more width, White jabs at it and squirts the ball in front of point, Morgan stops it well to prevent one;
0.1;?;Broad to White, no run slightly back of a length, around the line of off, White goes back and across and defends with a straight bat;

Twinky little countdown done with, Stuart Broad is ready to bowl the first ball...
7.35pm: Right, time to be getting on with things. The teams are expected out shortly - now, in fact, though we still appear to be waiting for something.
Here's Oliver Jones with a rallying cry to chill the bones: "Come on England. If nothing else, put in a performance that doesn't make anyone aged 25+ begging to go back to the days where our batting tail was Gough, Tufnell, Malcolm and Fraser."
7.30pm: The Olympic Park is home to Sydney Thunder #oneinarow, who might give England a game at the moment. There's a short straight boundary at each end, though the square looks green, hopefully a bit of pace in a hard, white drop-in strip.
"Thanks to ESPN team for a great two summers. Because I where I live I have barely seen a ball bowled or hit, from the start of Ashes one, but have enjoyed the coverage you provide regularly. It's all been good fun, even the defeats." It has been our pleasure, Steve Pickering. By and large. I'm sure Alex, Gnasher, George, David, Jarrod, Brydon, Dan and sundry others would agree (once they've left the darkened room).
7.20pm: This match also marks the end of the back-to-back Ashes grindathon, which began in England in July, around 7000 years ago. Has it all been worth it? No I'll leave you to decide. There's expected to be a crowd of 50,000 plus in the Olympic Stadium, so Australians clearly haven't tired of Pommie bashing yet.
Mark, for one, is praying for the shotgun to the temple: "For mercy's sake can we end this without playing the final, dead rubber, as they would in the Davis Cup?"
"Dernbach selected again !!! What more does a man have to do to be left out of a side." Haven't you read the preview, Shaun? He's one of today's key men - England need him to rediscover his box of tricks for the WT20.
7.10pm Australia have won the toss and will bat, George Bailey is grinning again, as he does. Australia have made two changes, with Chris Lynn, er, rested and Josh Hazlewood dropping out for Daniel Christian and Ben Cutting. England also make two changes, Jordan replacing James Tredwell and Ben Stokes in for Michael Lumb, with Luke Wright to open.
Australia) 1 Aaron Finch, 2 Cameron White, 3 Brad Hodge, 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 George Bailey (capt), 6 Matthew Wade (wk), 7 Daniel Christian, 8 Ben Cutting, 9 Nathan Coulter-Nile, 10 Mitchell Starc, 11 James Muirhead.
England 1 Luke Wright, 2 Alex Hales, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan, 5 Ravi Bopara, 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Ben Stokes, 8 Tim Bresnan, 9 Stuart Broad (capt), 10 Chris Jordan, 11 Jade Dernbach.
7.05pm: The toss and teams should be carried out momentarily - sounds like Chris Jordan is going to make a T20 debut, from noises around the ground.
England, as you'll know by now, have not only been beaten 11 times on this tour but they've also lost a coach. Jason Gillespie, a former team-mate of Australia coach Darren Lehmann and highly regarded for his work at Yorkshire, has ruled himself out of the running. Here are some of the other candidates to replace Andy Flower.
7pm: Hello and welcome - it's nearly all over. Has this been England's worst ever tour? Let's go with a simple 'Yes'. Losing at the earliest opportunity in three formats is pretty special and that's before you take into account the margin and nature of the defeats. Even a consolation victory here at the Olympic Stadium would be little consolation, though the fact this is their last stop in Australia may inspire a sort of demob happiness. Anyway, Australia, as ever, are looking to rub it in - as you'll discover in our preview. I'm Alan Gardner and I'll be joined by Alex Winter to read the last rites.
 Innings Start
Right, at long last this series is over and may Australia and England not play each other for a very long time! We've had enough fixtures to last a lifetime in this past eight months. But both teams are in action again pretty soon with Australia travelling to South Africa for a mouthwatering Test series and England back in action at the end of the month in the Caribbean with some one-day cricket ahead of the World T20. But we can now put this Ashes tour to bed, it's been long and quite often arduous, hope you've enjoyed it, we've been glad to have you along for the journey. From Monty and I, bye for now and speak soon...

Presentation time and once again Mark Taylor takes over. Stuart Broad has this to say: "It's been good fun throughout the tour, we've been hugely disappointing, not at the races for three months but you have to give credit to Australia. We've got a two-week break at home and then go to the Caribbean but we know we're a decent T20 side. We can now get together as a group for a decent period to work on specific things, improve and learn from this week. We've got a dangerous side. We've got to go to Bangladesh with confidence and hopefully we can get some momentum in the Caribbean."

Man of the Match goes to George Bailey for his fabulous striking at the end of the innings that took the game away from England. "We put in our best performance tonight. Credit to the guys. I've had a few lucky nights but we've played good cricket. It will be difficult to pick a side now for the Caribbean but it's a nice problem to have."

Today, England were doing quite well with a run of wickets but not for the first time the decent position was whipped from them. George Bailey did the damage in a final over spanking of Jade Dernbach and England were never going to chase 196 and never got in the game second innings.

All over, it had been all over for a long time really, Australia win by 84 runs which is a colossal margin in a T20. It wraps up a 3-0 victory in this series and completes a 12-1 annihilation for England on this trip which has been as miserable as a grey afternoon in Barnsley. Oh goodness have England been pathetic but at least it's all over for them now. Australia's giggling can continue because they have been totally dominant throughout the entire tour and simply been miles better.
17.2;W;Starc to Jordan, 1 run, OUT short outside off, pulled into midwicket, Dernbach wants to come back for two, whoopsie! It's never on and he's run out by a street trying to scramble back to the striker's end and that's a calamitous end to a truly horrendous tour for England;Jade Dernbach run out (Christian/?Wade) 1 (6m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
17.1;?;Starc to Jordan, no run full at the stumps, aims leg side and gets a thick edge into his pad;

16.2;?;Muirhead to Dernbach, no run back to cut or pull or smash it anywhere, he missed;
16.1;W;Muirhead to Broad, OUT length ball, Broad goes back to try and pull, misses and loses middle stump some sharp turn on that, Broad beaten all ends up and has to go. Nicely bowled;Stuart Broad b Muirhead 2 (7m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
15.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Jordan, no run swing and a miss at a full ball again, it grazes leg stump again;

14.6;?;Muirhead to Jordan, no run floated up on off stump, driven off a thick outside edge to backward point;
14.5;1;Muirhead to Broad, 1 run shorter, flicked around the corner to deep-backward square who's very fine;
14.4;?;Muirhead to Broad, no run tries to paddle sweep from outside off and misses;
14.3;W;Muirhead to Bresnan, OUT swing outside off, misses courtesy of the turn, Wade has the bails off and there's a strong appeal for a stumping and Wade was sharp to remove the bails as Bresnan dragged his bag foot a good two inches out of his ground and fails to get back in time;Tim Bresnan st ?Wade b Muirhead 14 (9m 7b 1x4 1x6) SR: 200;
14.2;6;Muirhead to Bresnan, SIX runs nice stride down the wicket and hammered down the ground, strong shot;

13.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Jordan, no run blocked on the back foot in front of off stump;
13.5;W;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, OUT huge swing at a full ball, gets a huge inside edge into his pad and it trickles slowly into leg stump and that is a very unfortunate way to go. The ball cannoned of the inside of his pad and agonisingly rolled steadily towards the stumps, glanced the base of the leg stick and off dropped the bail;Ravi Bopara b Coulter-Nile 4 (10m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80;
13.4;1;Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, 1 run huge swing and a thick inside edge to long leg;

12.6;1;Cutting to Bopara, 1 run short again, better pull but straight to deep-square;
12.5;1;Cutting to Bresnan, 1 run short and pulled off the splice of the bat, no-one at square leg so gets away with this for a single;
12.4;W;Cutting to Morgan, OUT length ball swung to leg, Morgan doesn't get all of this, in comes Starc from deep square leg, dives forward and takes the catch but of course when it's close, which this is, they will go upstairs to have a check and there's every chance this could be overturned but thankfully not because the catch looked clean. A fine take in fact, very sharp work, as has been all of Australia's fielding;Eoin Morgan c Starc b Cutting 34 (31m 20b 2x4 2x6) SR: 170;
12.3;1;Cutting to Bopara, 1 run Bapara steps back and flicks from off stump to short third man;

11.6;W;Christian to Buttler, OUT length ball, Buttler steps to leg and heaves over the on side but not far enough and he holes out to Maxwell at cow corner, simply not enough bat on that trying to clear the longest part of the ground;Jos Buttler c Maxwell b Christian 8 (11m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 88.88;
11.5;1;Christian to Morgan, 1 run Morgan steps to leg, Christian follows him and Morgan flicks it around the corner for a single;

10.3;?;Maxwell to Morgan, no run on the stumps, played back to the bowler;
10.2;?;Maxwell to Morgan, no run Maxwell scampers to the leg side to field off his own bowling;
10.1;4;Maxwell to Morgan, FOUR runs tossed up and slapped over the covers for another boundary, Morgan moving smoothly through the gears;

9.5;4;Cutting to Buttler, FOUR runs adroitly done by Buttler, a legcutter from Cutting and he waits on it before flicking a ramped four over the head of Wade. England need a few several lots more of those;
9.4;1;Cutting to Morgan, 1 run stays back in the crease, settles for a a dabbed single through square;
9.4;1w;Cutting to Morgan, 1 wide short and wide down the leg side as Morgan swings and misses;
9.3;1;Cutting to Buttler, 1 run short and at the batsman, who top-edges a pull, into a gap at square leg for one to get Buttler off the mark;
9.2;?;Cutting to Buttler, no run gets forward and punches a full delivery towards mid-off, turns down a tight single;
9.1;?;Cutting to Buttler, no run full and worked to leg, midwicket cuts it off;
8.6;W;Maxwell to Root, OUT off balance and launched into the sky towards deep midwicket, where Cutting is under it again! Root's labours are over, a knock that was scratchier than a pair of woollen undercrackers, scooped to leg and again nowhere near clearing the boundary rider;Joe Root c Cutting b Maxwell 11 (22m 21b 1x4 0x6) SR: 52.38;
8.5;?;Maxwell to Root, no run opens the shoulders, can't force the ball into a gap on the leg side;
8.4;?;Maxwell to Root, no run on the stumps, sweeps flat but picks out midwicket;
8.3;2;Maxwell to Root, 2 runs pushed through on leg stump, nurdles a couple through backward square;
8.2;1;Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run comes forward again and drills one to long-off;
8.1;4;Maxwell to Morgan, FOUR runs oh dear, Cutting has had a mare here, moving round the boundary at deep cover to stop a drive, he slides past it, makes the pick up and then somehow manages to toss it on to the rope, unable to pull it back in slow motion with a groping hand;
7.6;1;Christian to Morgan, 1 run Morgan leaves the crease and clumps one to long-on for another single;
7.5;1;Christian to Root, 1 run touch short, Root swats it aggressively down the ground for one;
7.4;1;Christian to Morgan, 1 run goes fuller, still outside off, squeezes one in front of square;
7.3;6;Christian to Morgan, SIX runs goes round the wicket, Morgan moves outside the line and plays an audacious scoop over fine leg! Clever batting and that's six more;
7.2;1;Christian to Root, 1 run gets forward and pushes this through the covers for a single;
7.1;?;Christian to Root, no run on the stumps, dabbed into the off side;
6.6;6;Maxwell to Morgan, SIX runs skips forward to a full ball and boings it over wide long-off! Such power in those wrists, the bottom hand coming through as a mere punch soars beyond the boundary for England's first maximum;
6.5;1;Maxwell to Root, 1 run pushed across from round the wicket, runs a single to short third man;
6.4;2b;Maxwell to Root, 2 byes full on the stumps, conventional slog-sweep attempted this time and the ball misses everything, they run a couple;
6.3;?;Maxwell to Root, no run floated up on the stumps, Root tries reverse-sweep and is hit on the pad, possibly a little glove saves him, as the umpire turns down Maxwell's appeal;
6.2;1;Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run tossed up and punched down the ground on the front foot;
6.1;2;Maxwell to Morgan, 2 runs darted outside off, comes forward and chips a couple over the infield towards deep extra cover;
5.6;?;Cutting to Root, no run goes back and cuts hard, it's stopped well at backward point and then Morgan has to throw himself back to regain his ground at the other end;
5.5;1;Cutting to Morgan, 1 run length ball on off stump, pushes at it and in inside edge runs short and square on the leg side for one;
5.4;1;Cutting to Root, 1 run bit of width, opens the face and steers one to third man;
5.3;4;Cutting to Root, FOUR runs drags this short and Root plays a orthodox pull, flat and in front of deep midwicket, where Muirhead gets to it on the slide but only manages to flip the ball beyond the rope for four;
5.2;?;Cutting to Root, no run on the stumps, pushed back on the up to mid-on;
5.1;?;Cutting to Root, no run pitched up outside the line of off, Root chops into the ground towards point;
4.6;W;Maxwell to Stokes, OUT heave ho, off he goes, a loopy leading edge caught on the edge of the ring! Stokes laid the dynamite but only succeeded in blowing himself up, swinging hard and falling harder, the ball looped towards point and Cutting took an excellent catch back-pedalling;Ben Stokes c Cutting b Maxwell 5 (9m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125;
4.5;1;Maxwell to Root, 1 run full and wide of the stumps, Root mows across the line, gets a bottom edge that bounces over the stumps, past Wade for one;
4.4;?;Maxwell to Root, no run tossed up, pushed back to the bowler's right, Maxwell doesn't completely stop it but mid-on prevents a run;
4.3;?;Maxwell to Root, no run flat, on the stumps, turned to midwicket;
4.2;1;Maxwell to Stokes, 1 run angled in, worked wide of mid-on for one;
4.1;4;Maxwell to Stokes, FOUR runs pushed through flat outside off from round the wicket, Stokes makes room to swing a cross-batted drive through the covers for four;
3.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Root, no run gets across and defends a length ball square on the off side - another cracking over from Coulter-Nile, keeping the pressure on;
3.5;?;Coulter-Nile to Root, no run off-stump line from Coulter-Nile, Root again plays watchfully with a straight bat;
3.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Root, no run shuffles across and plays a length ball into the off side;
3.3;W;Coulter-Nile to Hales, OUT now Hales has picked out deep square leg, this time on the run! Sweetly timed, a little pick-up swivel pull, but not enough to clear the boundary, there is only one man out there but he made good ground and England lose both openers in similar fashion;Alex Hales c Muirhead b Coulter-Nile 6 (16m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 75;
3.2;4;Coulter-Nile to Hales, FOUR runs driven on the up just over extra cover, first boundary for Hales, got enough on it and cleared the infield;
3.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Hales, no run slightly short of a length, follows the batsman, who plays it on to his body aiming to leg;
2.6;4lb;Starc to Stokes, 4 leg byes full, attempted yorker, I think, slides down the leg side, flick of pad and it beats Wade's dive;
2.5;W;Starc to Wright, OUT drops short, pulled... straight to deep square leg! So Wright gets another single-figure score, despite moving up the order, he was in position to play the shot, went aerial but can't have been looking at the field. Cutting did a two-step to his right and then settled for the take;Luke Wright c Cutting b Starc 8 (12m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
2.4;?;Starc to Wright, no run gets away with a full toss, on the stumps and hacked back down the track, Starc collects in his follow through and the scorers mark a dot;
2.3;?;Starc to Wright, no run quick and in the channel outside off, another swing and a miss from Wright;
2.2;1;Starc to Hales, 1 run goes for the inswinging yorker, gets enough bat on it to squeeze one through backward point;
2.1;?;Starc to Hales, no run pitched up, outside the line of off, squeezed to point as Hales chops down on it;
2.1;1w;Starc to Hales, 1 wide fired full and wide of the stumps... too wide;
1.6;4;Coulter-Nile to Wright, FOUR runs and he cashes that cheque, denying the bowler a maiden with a scooped four down the leg side from a short delivery on the stumps;
1.5;?;Coulter-Nile to Wright, no run is that a drop? Replays suggest it might have been, Coulter-Nile certainly thinks so, Wade fumbling a low take to his left as Wright got a thin edge down the leg side trying to glance off his hips;
1.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Wright, no run bit of width, Wright swings hard but fails to connect, might have bounced a tad more than expected;
1.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Wright, no run NCN is up at 88mph, tight line in the corridor, Wright steers straight to point from the crease;
1.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Wright, no run fuller, around off stump, comes forward and taps into the covers;
1.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Wright, no run length ball in the channel outside off, Wright plays a watchful leave. Lovely;
0.6;1;Starc to Wright, 1 run pitched up around off stump, big backlift from Wright but he doesn't connect cleanly and gets just a single wide of mid-on;
0.5;2;Starc to Wright, 2 runs short of a length, on the hips and nurdled behind square for a couple;
0.4;1;Starc to Hales, 1 run full and wide again, steered this time down to third man;
0.3;?;Starc to Hales, no run pitched up in the channel, swings the arms and chops a bump ball into the hands of cover point;
0.2;?;Starc to Hales, no run again this comes back, Hales is a little stuck in the crease and gets an inside edge on to his pads, the ball just dropping past leg stump;
0.1;1;Starc to Wright, 1 run over the wicket, on a length and there's a hint of inswing as Wright closes the face, works one past midwicket;

Luke Wright is going to face the first ball, he's had a good BBL opening the batting for the Stars. Mitchell Starc has the ball
Howdy, back again. That final over may have put a cork in the tour for England. Oh Jade... This will again be a record chase, though it's not above 200, despite George Bailey's best efforts.
