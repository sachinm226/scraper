8.35pm A fantastic innings from Faf du Plessis has set up a fascinating first-day declaration from South Africa. Australia will have a nervy 12-over period before stumps under lights. A statement of intent from Faf.
75.6;4;Starc to du Plessis, FOUR runs superb shot. Quite full outside off, Faf lofts his drive and smashes it past mid-off for four and immediately trots off. South Africa have declared;
75.5;3;Starc to Shamsi, 3 runs a low full toss on off, so badly skewed that a drive intended to go to mid-off almost carries to the midwicket boundary. Three more. Crucial runs;

6.5;W;Starc to Elgar, OUT taken this time. 145 kph. Superb bowling. Just lovely. Full delivery outside off, but what this one has is some swing.

1.58pm Right then. Lovely sunny afternoon. Stephen Cook will face the new pink ball. Three slips for Mitch Starc. Off we go then.
1.41pm Here's some trivia. This is the first time since the 1981 Ashes series in England that Australia have given Test caps to five players, in a series. Also, Firdose tells me Jimmy Cook faced the first delivery for SA in white-ball cricket back in 1992. Stephen Cook may face the first pink-ball delivery in 2016.
Nathan Pringle: "Tempering expectations, but excited to see the new look batting line-up. Looking forwards, would like to think they find a starting place for Shaun Marsh once he's back fit. Quality player."
Shailesh: "Nikhil, SA will be possibly bowling fourth innings; do you think having a wrist spinner in the form of Shamshi will come handy (looking at the pitch)?" Possible, but may have to play the support role through the Test.
Jk: "I also remember that Jimmy Cook played SA's first ball after readmission into test cricket in Durban in 92. Unfortunately for him, he was dismissed caught at slip off Kapil Dev"
Kaushal: "Hopefully, this is a start of a new era for Australia. David Warner with his opening partner who can do a Cowan, Smith and Handscomb in the middle, Wade/Nevill (hopefully he's not discarded) and Maddinson in the lower middle and the perennially competitive bowlers. "
1.30pm Du Plessis wins the toss and South Africa opt to bat
Tabraiz Shamsi is making his Test debut too, he comes in for Keshav Maharaj.
"I'm just glad that I can play some cricket and hopefully extend that lead of ours," says Faf. "It was absolutely amazing. A great spectacle. Slightly less grass than last year, the ball has changed a bit so might not do as much," says Steven Smith.
Renshaw was handed his cap by Ian Healy, Handscomb by Chris Rogers and Maddinson by Simon Katich.
Mal: "Smith last won the toss in February 2016, in NZ. He has lost every toss since the tour to Sri Lanka. Time for a new tossing coach?"
1.20pm The toss isn't far away. Not sure what I'd be doing actually. Australia has confirmed their XI: David Warner, Matt Renshaw, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith (capt), Peter Handscomb, Nic Maddinson, Matthew Wade (wk), Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon, Jackson Bird.
1.10pm In the South African camp, the mood is not as boisterous as it should be, they've already beaten one of the best away. And here's why. A reminder that Faf du Plessis was found guilty of ball-tampering, but is allowed to play this game. All those years back, it began here for Faf.
Law 42.3: "polishing the ball provided that no artificial substance is used," has its problems and Firdose Moonda explains why.
Nathan: "Still baffled how Cameron White wasn't picked but nonetheless looking forward to today" Looking ahead to the future probably?
1.00pm An extraordinary sequence of events has panned out over the past few days/weeks. A lot has gone on, a lot said, a lot not said. Finally, it is now time to put all that behind us and look forward to cricket. It's Test-match time. It's day-night Test match time. Adelaide will host its second day-night Test, the first one a win for Australia against trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand. South Africa will pose a different challenge though and Australia now aren't quite what they were back then, personnel and otherwise.
Plenty has gone on in the Australia camp since the Hobart debacle, including but not limited to David Warner's new batting partner. This is another.
Pranay: "Afternoon mate :) So begins a test which despite being a dead rubber could have been a classic but has been terribly marred by off-field issues. However, despite the controversy related to ball tampering, if Australian players don't step up in this match, it will do a great damage to their confidence. World Cricket needs a confident (not over) and competitive (not over) Australia!"
 Innings Start
3.33pm That will be tea as well. Australia have played out the first session and added some crucial runs. They end with a first-innings lead of 124, a more than handy advantage at this stage of the game. South Africa will have to bat again to stay in this game.
121.1;W;Rabada to Bird, OUT edged and gone. Superb catch from Faf. That was flying.

90.6;?;Philander to Starc, no run good length on middle, the ball darts back in this time and hits Starc on the thigh pad;
90.5;W;Philander to Wade, OUT edged and taken. There's that length, this one doesn't beat the bat. It kisses the outside edge. Full delivery outside off, the ball seams away and takes the outside edge. Carries low to de Kock's left.

89.5;W;Rabada to Maddinson, OUT straight through. Maddinson has a duck on debut. Not much Maddinson could do about that. Rabada finds it in him to give it all he has. Some more oomph, more pace, more venom and delivers a searing yorker on off and middle that swings in late. Maddinson gets his bat down but Rabada has outdone him with sheer pace. That is a sensational ball. These aren't conditions you want to be making your debut in. Unfortunate for Maddinson.;Nic Maddinson b Rabada 0 (16m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

86.1;W;Abbott to Handscomb, OUT that was always going to happen with Handscomb's persistence to play back. Full delivery outside offm, the ball seams back in and goes through a big gap between bat and pad to clatter into off stump. End of a fabulous debut innings, but he will have to work that front-foot problem out. A little bit of inward seam movement gets the wicket. Well bowled.;Peter Handscomb b Abbott 54 (109m 78b 6x4 0x6) SR: 69.23;

82.5;1;Abbott to Handscomb, 1 run that's a direct hit at the non-striker's end and Handscomb may be in trouble here. No, in fact, he's made it. The dive came in handy and the bat is grounded as he dives in. Coming to the ball, it was full and outside off. Handscomb came forward and dropped it right in front of point before taking off for a quick single. Bavuma picks it up and nails a direct hit at the non-striker's end, but after a long, hard look, the TV umpire rules that the bat is grounded;

79.1;?;Shamsi to Handscomb, no run short delivery on off, Handscomb cuts to slip. Faf is reviewing, was there pad first? Definitely hit glove. Looks like there is some pad just before it hits the bat. But the ball is going over the stumps. Not a stroke Handscomb should be playing with five balls to the new ball. Handscomb lost his bat while returning to the crease and plonked his hand back in. Amla's throw misses the stumps, would have been out with a direct hit;
78.6;?;Bavuma to Khawaja, no run decent over. Tight around off, Khawaja gets his head over the ball to defend;
