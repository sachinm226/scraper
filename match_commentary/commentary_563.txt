Data
This is a decent score by Australia, 230 could prove a tricky target on this pitch. Michael Hussey was the star for the visitors, playing a knock straight out of the Michael Bevan handbook - nudging the ball around, running hard and only a few boundaries. Ponting made yet another half-century but got out just after he and Hussey had set up a solid platform.
Praveen Kumar got plenty of swing at the start of the innings, the part-time spinners exploited the conditions well and Jadeja had another good outing with the ball.
Matt from Australia asks: "Why is Jon Holland not playing for Australia? This is obviously a spinner's paradise and its not like our frontline bowlers are playing. When will he get a game?"

The Australians are out. Ponting's opening the innings. Praveen Kumar has the ball.
Teams: Three changes for Australia. The teams are up above. As you can see, Bollinger replaces Hilfenhaus, Manou comes in for Paine while Moises Henriques replaces Shaun Marsh. It's also Henriques' debut. He's not an unfamiliar face for Indian audiences. He was part of the NSW team which won the Champions League. Very decent middle order hitter and useful seamer.
Just had a look at the pitch and well, there are quite a few cracks. I wouldn't mind at all if it's a low scoring game. I'm sick of these 300-plus belters. Are you?
Toss: Australia are batting. Ponting's happy to win it. We'll give you the teams shortly. India are unchanged. Manou aside, Ponting indicated there were a couple more changes.
The decision to bat was a no-brainer actually. This pitch will play slower than the other two surfaces and batsmen will find it a bit difficult under lights. Ponting reckons 220-230 is a good score. He's cheered up after what happened yesterday. The Australians complained about the poor quality of the practice wickets - they were wet and unusable. Why? Because of a miscommunication about the arrival timings of the visitors. The groundsman apparently wasn't informed properly.
1.50 pm: It's a good Saturday to all you following this game between India and Australia at the Feroz Shah Kotla in New Delhi. It's a really busy day for all of us here but don't worry, we're not going to pile it on you guys. The toss is about 10 minutes away.
The first bit of news we can confirm is that Graham Manou will be making his debut for Australia. Manou's turning out to be the 'last-minute man' for Australia. Few months back in the Ashes, he replaced Brad Haddin after the toss. Now he's here as an emergency replacement for Tim Paine.
The bigger talking point over the last couple of days was the pitch. We'll get to that as soon as the experts make their predictions.
 Innings Start
Yuvraj and Dhoni made the difference today. A 148-run stand in a low-scoring game was too much for Australia to overcome. They fought till the end though, but just couldn't get the breakthrough they needed. India were certainly nervous after Gambhir was dismissed, but that big stand meant the home side take the lead.
Post-match presentation:
Ricky Ponting: "We were in a good position at 60 for 3, we needed to take a couple of wickets in the middle of the innings, Yuvraj and Dhoni were superb, we had our moments but did not capitalise.
"The ball change was the best time to score (when Aus were batting) but we lost a bit of momentum there. India outplayed us today. It was definitely a better batting surface earlier in the day. We have lost two games in a row, hopefully we'll get a few more runs on the board in Mohali."
MS Dhoni: "With Yuvraj at the other end it is always easy. With seven wickets in hand and a Powerplay to go, we wanted to play out their best bowlers and go after their part-timers.
"On this wicket, I think everybody bowled well. I'm really happy. If there was no dew 220-230 could have been difficult to chase. The pitch was looking really ugly. All in all, it was a great team effort."
Yuvraj Singh is the Man of the Match. "Yeah, I was a bit rusty at the start. It was a slow wicket at the start, so I wanted to take some time. Most of the time I have a lot of criticism that I can't play on slow wickets or against spin, so I was proving myself here. I think it was slightly better to bat on second, but it was not a good batting wicket. Hopefully, Mohali will be a better wicket."
That's it from us at Cricinfo today. Thanks for the mails and the company. Do joins us again on Monday for the Mohali game.
