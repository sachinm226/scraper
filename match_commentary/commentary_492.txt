Hello and welcome everyone to Hamilton for the Third ODI between New Zealand and Australia. The series is locked at 1-all and today's match shapes as a very important encounter with the loser having to win the final two games of the series.
Ricky Ponting has called heads correctly and Australia will surprisingly bowl first. Ponting says he has done his homework and they realise that teams chasing have a good record - most notably when NZ chased down 347 to win in 2007.
With Michael Clarke having to rush home for personal reasons, Adam Voges comes into the XI and will fit into the middle order 'somewhere' according to Ponting.
Daniel Vettori is delighted with the news that Ross Taylor has passed a fitness test so he is back into the XI after missing the Second ODI in Auckland. However, Daryl Tuffey is out with a calf strain and he is replaced by Michael Mason.
NZ: McCullum, Ingram, Guptill, Taylor, Stryis, Broom, Hopkins, Vettori, Southee, Bond, Mason.
Aus: Watson, Haddin, Ponting, White, Hussey, Voges, Hopes, Johnson, Hauritz, Harris, Bollinger.
Conditions are overcast but the pitch is in fine condition. The curator has left a fair bit of grass on it but it has been browned off nicely so hopefully there will be some good bounce and carry for the bowlers.
My name is Marc Ellison and I look forward to bringing you what promises to be an intriguing contest between two quality and competitive teams.
The ground is a sell out and slowly the fans are filling the seats. With the level of interest and hype in this series, it will be interesting to gauge the level of noise from the capacity crowd. Join us in 5 minutes for the first ball.
 Innings Start
Australia win by the comfortable margin of six wickets with 16 balls to spare. Australia outplayed New Zealand in all departments today and will take a lot of momentum into the 4th ODI in Auckland on Thursday.
Haddin (110) and Ponting (69) added 151 for the second wicket and the match was over pretty early in that sense with both players looking in total control at the crease.
New Zealand simply did not score enough runs and the Batting Power Play worked to their detriment as they lost five for 32 to be bowled out for 246 when, with Styris and Hopkins at the crease, they looked like posting close to 300 which would've been a far more competitive total.
Daniel Vettori blames the top order for a poor showing as the reason why they weren't able to post a competitive total. He says the wicket was more like a 300 run track and not the 250 they scored. He says injuries are an issue and he is hopeful that they have 15 fit players for Thursday.
Ricky Ponting is obviously chuffed with the team for their efforts and admits that bowling first was the right choice in the end and that, possibly, that could be the way to go in the future. He says his batsmen need to continue to make big scores and is happy they take the momentum to Auckland.
Brad Haddin deservedly takes the Man of the Match award for his magnificent 110. Haddin is glad to push on to three figures after getting a few starts in the series, especially with his skipper putting the pressure on the top order for someone to make a ton.
Thanks for joining us today. Join us again on Thursday at 1400 local time, that is 0100 GMT for the 4th ODI from Auckland.
This is Marc Ellison on behalf of the crew here at Cricinfo saying thanks again and we will see you soon. Bye for now.
