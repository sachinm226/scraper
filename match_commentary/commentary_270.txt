Data
That's a formidable total from Australia. White and Finch at the top were excellent and just as it looked as if England were dragging it back slightly, Lynn played a lovely little hand on debut to push Australia on. England have plenty of batting to do and they will begin their chase in 10 minutes...
19.6;2;Dernbach to Christian, 2 runs swept hard and gets it between deep-midwicket and deep-square leg for a couple;
19.5;4;Dernbach to Christian, FOUR runs steps right across the line and takes a length ball behind square on the leg side, somehow forces it between keeper and the 45;
19.4;1;Dernbach to Lynn, 1 run right up there again, tries to play straight and forces it back to the bowler, they steal a single;
19.3;4;Dernbach to Lynn, FOUR runs full at the stumps, Lynn steps to the off side and paddle sweeps, gets it over the 45 and that runs away for four, lovely touch;

19.1;W;Dernbach to Bailey, OUT full delivery outside off out of the back of the hand, swung hard at and gets it straight up in the air and Bresnan takes the catch at point;George Bailey c Bresnan b Dernbach 14 (29m 14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100;
18.6;1;Bresnan to Bailey, 1 run full and wide, reached for again and gets a toe end to cover, 200 up;
18.5;4;Bresnan to Bailey, FOUR runs low full toss and Bailey finally times one, clubbing this wide of mid-on;
18.4;1;Bresnan to Lynn, 1 run full and wide, reached for and gets a toe-end out to deep cover;
18.3;6;Bresnan to Lynn, SIX runs just misses the length and gets whacked over long-off, lovely clean hit;
18.2;?;Bresnan to Lynn, no run yorker length just inside the guideline offside off - I love that delivery - tried to be chopped away but missed;
18.1;2;Bresnan to Lynn, 2 runs full outside off, swung down the ground off a thick inside edge to long-off, they take on the fielder and get back for two, Bailey doesn't want the bowling;
17.6;1;Dernbach to Lynn, 1 run steps across the line and swings to leg, not struck properly and a good job for Lynn because it lands in front of deep-square leg running in;
17.5;?;Dernbach to Lynn, no run yorker at the stumps, forced back to the bowler;
17.5;5nb;Dernbach to Lynn, (no ball) full toss at the body, Lynn gloves it down the leg side and it runs for four, definitely a no ball on height but byes given! I don't think so;
17.4;6;Dernbach to Lynn, SIX runs length ball, Lynn steps to leg and swings it into the building site, nailed it. But the length was simply the wrong one;
17.3;?;Dernbach to Lynn, no run full at leg stump, driven back to the bowler, well saved from Dernbach;

16.5;2;Bresnan to Bailey, 2 runs full just outside off, steered wide of third man for a couple;

15.1;W;Bopara to Maxwell, OUT full on the stumps, goes to reverse slog sweep and chips it to point easy catch for Bresnan. Horrible shot really, he never gets his head down enough does Maxwell. Back of the hand delivery from Bopara does the trick, Maxwell never got under the full delivery;Glenn Maxwell c Bresnan b Bopara 20 (24m 13b 2x4 1x6) SR: 153.84;
14.6;1;Broad to Maxwell, 1 run length ball on off stump, dabbed into the covers for a single;
14.5;?;Broad to Maxwell, no run full at the off stump, a huge heave to leg brings an inside edge that doesn't carry through to Buttler;

13.5;1w;Briggs to Maxwell, 1 wide leg side wide;
13.4;6;Briggs to Maxwell, SIX runs goes again and this is nailed over cover for six! Pietersen-esque! Nails the reverse slog sweep into the stands, amazing shot;

12.6;1;Wright to Bailey, 1 run full on the stumps, pressed into midwicket for an easy single;
12.5;W;Wright to White, OUT full and straight, White swings hard across the line, huge appeal for lbw and given out England needed that badly. Looks pretty straight and struck the pad low, so it looks likely that would have hit leg stump, Hawk Eye has it only clipping but the real time shot looked good;Cameron White lbw b Wright 75 (57m 43b 6x4 4x6) SR: 174.41;
12.4;1;Wright to Maxwell, 1 run length on the stumps, tried to be swung to leg and gets a toe end into the leg side for a single;
12.4;2nb;Wright to White, (no ball) 1 run full toss wide of off stump, swung at and it comes off a huge top edge and short long leg comes in and takes the catch but the bowler's end umpire has called no-ball on height, I'm not too sure about that, they're not even checking upstairs. Or maybe they are now asking for the third umpire, which makes perfect sense, it's close but plenty of these are ruled okay. Rule is standing position in the crease to judge on these things. But the third umpire is sticking with the on-field call;
12.3;4;Wright to White, FOUR runs full a foot outside off, slapped wide of long-on, excellent placement, timed well too;
12.2;4;Wright to White, FOUR runs cutter on the stumps and White manages to steer it backward of square, unlucky for the bowler that;
12.1;6;Wright to White, SIX runs steps to leg and heaves a length ball across the line onto the bank over midwicket;
11.6;?;Briggs to Maxwell, no run goes for the slog sweep and it hits the pad and runs not far enough away from Buttler for a leg bye;

11.3;2;Briggs to White, 2 runs plays forward and runs it in between the two deep leg side fielders;
11.2;1;Briggs to Maxwell, 1 run goes for the reverse sweep first ball and was lucky to get some glove on that in front of all three, it rebounds to point and they get a quick single;

10.6;1;Broad to White, 1 run full at the stumps, driven to long-on;
10.5;4;Broad to White, FOUR runs delicately ran down fine past short third man, deft touch from just outside off;
10.4;W;Broad to Finch, OUT but this carries to long-on as Finch swung hard at a length ball, aiming at the leg side and didn't get it anywhere near the middle, straight to Hales who took a solid catch;Aaron Finch c Hales b Broad 52 (46m 31b 5x4 3x6) SR: 167.74;
10.3;1;Broad to White, 1 run full toss on the stumps, tried to be swung to leg, totally miscued off the splice but it's hit so badly it falls well short of long-on running in;
10.2;1;Broad to Finch, 1 run full length at the stumps, forced down to long-on;
10.1;?;Broad to Finch, no run full length wide of off stump, Finch had stepped to leg and was well away from it;
9.6;2;Briggs to White, 2 runs tossed up and pushed out to deep-midwicket but Bopara is too slow coming in and it's two more and fifty for White;

9.1;4;Briggs to White, FOUR runs full length on the stumps, flourishing swing through the line, opens the face and whacks it wide of long-off, fabulous stroke;

8.1;1w;Bopara to Finch, 1 wide slower ball outside off, called wide but it was inside the guideline outside off and Finch was simply done in the flight;
7.6;4;Briggs to White, FOUR runs dabbed reverse sweep, bit of an edge but gets it very fine and it skips away to the boundary;
7.5;1;Briggs to Finch, 1 run full length at middle and leg, tucked through square leg, they push for two but it's not on;

4.4;1;Dernbach to Finch, 1 run slower ball on off stump, dabbed into the covers and they race a single;

Players are on the way out for the first of three T20s, a packed crowd here in Hobart. Finch and White marching to the crease to open the batting for Australia and Stuart Broad has the new ball...

7.20pm So can England, rid of several players worn down by a tough tour, end this trip on a high? They've got a useful T20 side, including the No. 1-ranked T20 batsman in the world. And I would say they have more power in their order than Australia today.

Couple of surprises in the team selection. Australia hand debuts to both batsman Chris Lynn and legspinner James Muirhead. No David Warner for them or Shane Watson, both rested for this series.

Australia 1. Aaron Finch, 2. Cameron White, 3. Glenn Maxwell, 4 George Bailey (capt), 5 Chris Lynn, 6 Dan Christian, 7 Moises Henriques, 8 Matthew Wade (wkt), 9 Nathan Coulter-Nile, 10 Josh Hazlewood, 11 James Muirhead

England bring in several fresh faces in Michael Lumb, Alex Hales, Luke Wright, Jade Dernbach and spinner Danny Briggs.

England 1 Michael Lumb, 2 Alex Hales, 3 Luke Wright, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Jos Buttler (wkt), 7 Ravi Bopara, 8 Tim Bresnan, 9 Stuart Broad (capt), 10 Jade Dernbach, 11 Danny Briggs

7.05pm Hello and welcome to the first T20 between Australia and England as this tour reaches its final leg. First to the toss and Australia have won it and will bat first as the hosts attempt to complete a clean sweep of all the formats. But, writes Daniel Brettig, the T20s provide England with a winning chance.
 Innings Start
That's all from Hobart, two more games to come in this series, Melbourne on Friday and Sydney on Sunday, same time, same channel you be sure of it, bye for now...

Here's the Presentation. Man of the Match is Cameron White for his innings at the top of the order. We haven't heard from George Bailey so I can't bring you the thoughts of the winning skipper I'm afraid.

Change of captain for England but Stuart Broad has simply inherited the losers badge: "I didn't think 213 was actually too many. When you've got big powerful hitters targeting a short boundary it's hard to keep the run-rate below 10. We didn't lay a platform to give ourselves the best chance. We didn't play as well as we could have done. Scoreboard pressure played a big part and you're always going to feel the pressure. We've come back from losses and hopefully we'll do that at the MCG. We could have taken our catches, that was important and that's happened all year. In Tests last year we dropped 35 catches and we need to iron that out."

Lovely innings from Bopara, a new career top score for him in international T20s, but he was left with far too much work to do after the top order failed and England have lost again, Australia taking this opening T20 by 13 runs. That England made 200 in reply shows what could have been achieved but their batting wasn't up to scratch at all. By contrast Australia had big innings from Cameron White and Aaron Finch at the top of the order and their middle order cameo - from debutant Chris Lynn - has basically won them the game in the end. Not a day for the bowlers.

Spin to start, from Glenn Maxwell
Hello everyone, Alan here for the second dig. England's openers have a tough act to follow, though the total isn't quite as daunting as the 248 Australia racked up at the Ageas Bowl last year... England have never successfully chased 200 or more in T20, though they came close last year against New Zealand at The Oval. This target is actually more than they managed in the final ODI last week...
