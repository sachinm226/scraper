Data
4.32pm Australia were 50 for 1 in 5.3 overs, then 80 for 1 before the collapse started. It looked at that time that they would race away to 300 at least, some said 400, but New Zealand, backed by the crowd, fought back very well led by Boult's five wickets to wrap them up. Boult and Vettori both stifled the batsmen together once Watson fell and at least Maxwell, Marsh and Clarke threw their wickets away. Haddin's 43 took Australia past 150 but that did not stop NZ from bowling their opposition out for the third time in a row in this World Cup. Back with the chase in 10 minutes...

1.58pm Toss done, national anthems done, NZ team huddle done. They are taking over the ground and out walk David Warner and Aaron Finch. What a mouthwatering contest this is going to be, those two against Tim Southee and Trent Boult. Hope your pocorn's ready and not in the microwave still. We're about to start, fasten your seatbelts, Southee runs in with two slips in place...
Andrew McGlashan tweets as the Australian national anthem starts: Nowhere near a full house yet, but those here gave Warner's name a loud boo as he was announced. Then huge cheer for McCullum.
Some numbers from our stats man Rajesh: Teams chasing have won 6 of the last 7 day-night ODIs in Auckland. One game was tied.
Noor: "World Cup starts today!!!"
"I have been amused a little by talk emanating from New Zealand that they have given up on sledging," Ricky Ponting wrote in his column. What did he say about McCullum and Clarke, read it here. There's still time before the first ball.
Remember, the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy will also be up for grabs today. Last time it was seen was during the 2011 World Cup match in Nagpur.
1.30pm Australia have won the toss and will bat first.
Michael Clarke: The wicket looks fantastic, pretty even for both teams whether we bat first or bowl. Conditions little similar to what we have back home. There's a good crowd, let's hope we can entertain them. Cummins comes in for Hazlewood. We've played a lot about our squad playing a big role in the tournament.
Brendon McCullum: We'd have bowled first as well, pretty favourable to the team bowling first. The wicket looks great, outfield looks amazing. We've trained hard for the last couple of days, this is certainly one of the big games for us. Same team for us, that's the beauty of our side and we'll chase whatever total they set us.
Shane Warne says the pitch looks a belter and there may not be much pace in it. Looks a bit slow, he says, and the boundaries are short of course. It's all about putting runs up on the board.




Clarke is back, NZ unchanged for the fourth straight game, there's a lot adding to this game, but Daniel Vettori said earlier the rivalry is overstated.
Our man Andrew McGlashan at the ground says: A glorious day in Auckland, warm and sunny. Players out on the outfield warming up and the crowd slowly making their way in after filling the local cafes on a Saturday morning. Loads of coverage of this game in the local media. Hope it lives up to the hype.
Nitin: "Every 2 days I see another batting record broken in WC2015, I am waiting for some bowling records to be broken in this game"
Daud: "If this match is even half as exciting as the #AFGvSCO match, I'll be happy."
1pm Martin Crowe, who scored a hundred against Australia in the 1992 World Cup, says McCullum is firing all cylinders and NZ have an edge. Watch our exclusive interview here.
Browy: "I feel like I'm 14 again waiting for this match to start - haven't been this keen for a limited overs match in years."
Pete: "Despite so many good players, I still think NZ is all about B.Mac. Just remove his name from the team list and see how it looks like..."
Jason: "Smart move by local media to focus all week on mcCullum. This takes all the focus off Williamson and Anderson who have been overlooked in discussions . Both spell danger for Australia "








Joe @ homebush: "Can we get a close match between 2 test nations today in #cwc15???? All other top 10 match ups have fizzled to no contest."
Nick: "I don't think we should be too worried about the Scotland game. The focus was on achieving the win as quickly as possible, ideally in 25 overs to boost the NRR. Although 7 wickets were lost they did exactly what they set out to do and at no point did it really look like we'd lose!"
Ravi: "I think this is going to be an one sided affair. All matches between the test playing nations so far have been one sided. This is not going to be any different. Sorry guys for being pessimistic" Won't the first hour be crucial?
Spencer : "I'll go for NZ, though i'm an Aussie. I hope Clarke - looking for time in the middle - won't prove to be a disruption to a team that has functioned brilliantly in his absence "
12.35pm It's the 15th day of the World Cup, the 20th match, and two of the strongest teams come face to face to kickstart this weekend, in Auckland. Hello everyone, this is Vishal Dikshit, and welcome to our coverage of New Zealand v Australia, the clash of the co-hosts. Which is a stronger team, which one is the favourite for the tournament, what's the importance of the match...read all of that in our preview right here.
Looks like a sunny day at Eden Park:



Adhithya Sriniv: "Mccullum vs Mitch... Clarke vs Vettori... Maxwell vs Anderson... Warner/Finch vs Southee/ Boult.... If this is not the best match of the tournament nothing is.... Coming from an Indian... Cant wait..."
sais: "Good words from Baz - 'You can't win every game, but you can control what you bring to the table.'"
"My heart desperately wants NZ to win this one, but my brain tells me that Aus is the stronger team and should win 70% of the time. I think the match against Scotland put a bit of a chink into the "NZ as favourites" line. We've beaten Sri Lanka (who we know inside out by now), Scotland, and a woefully out of form England side... Still, #backtheblackcaps" How did you arrive at 70%, Mike?
Krunal: "This is one of the exciting match I look forward to, real test of NZ batting side and OZ bowling side...however NZ bowling will be on a high test today too!"
 Innings Start
7.32pm What a match this turned out to be! Australia started strong, NZ shook their batting order, and were then cruising in their chase of 152 before Starc bowled beautifully to pull Australia back. They were only one wicket away from defending 151 in a tournament where 300 is being scored rather easily. The crowd got their money's worth for this slender one-wicket win! Exhilarating stuff here from the co-hosts, the closest of this World Cup, for sure, between Test-playing nations. Yes, finally we have one.
Trent Boult is the Man of the Match: We tied them down very nicely and in my mind was to come back in the second spell and take wickets, didn't think I would get five. We pulled it back nicely and everyone chipped in to make it a chaseable total. We've been working well for the last 6-12 months and move forward to the game next Sunday to get some more wins.
Michael Clarke: Very entertaining and we'd have liked it to go the other way. Our batting was horrendous to put it politely. Starc is a genius. I think both teams would say we didn't bat the way we'd have liked. Credit to the groundsmen, it was a very good pitch. Credit to New Zealand the way they bowled and executed their skills very well, we let ourselves down with the bat.
Brendon McCullum: One hell of a game. Both teams showed what quality their bowlers are. Starc for them and Boult for us, both were outstanding and the support was outstanding as well. We saw some great pace and swing bowling. We want to be an aggressive team with bat, ball and on the field as well. Everyone wants to see 300 scores, but 150 is great as well, with only one wicket down. Boult and Southee are outstanding in both Tests and ODIs, they have done well for a very long time, without disrespect to anyone.
The match has finished a good two hours early, but nobody will complain about the way it went. Thrilling pace and swing bowling, like Baz said, and what a delight these low-scoring thrillers are. We have the other match going on, India v UAE in Perth, so tune in to that and enjoy the weekend. It's goodbye from Vishal. Ciao!

19.4;W;Maxwell to Anderson, OUT he slogs and he gives a catch! It was a length delivery just outside off, Anderson went down on a knee for the slog sweep and slammed it straight to mid on where Cummins took a good, low catch. They are checking for the catch now, Anderson waiting at the boundary.

6.4;4;Johnson to McCullum, FOUR runs he is ripping into his mate here! Another one targetted at the arm and another one swatted with utter disdain over the man at short fine;

4.4;1;Johnson to Williamson, 1 run drives the length ball on off but gets an inside edge on the leg side for one;

2.4;?;Johnson to McCullum, no run 147kmh, that was quick, hits him on the arm! The short ball on leg crammed Baz up, he made some room and had absolutely no time to react, and ended up taking it on the arm, very close to the elbow;
2.3;?;Johnson to McCullum, no run yorker this time on middle and leg, he pushes it on the off side as there was no room;
2.2;4;Johnson to McCullum, FOUR runs overpitched again and Baz clears his front foot to muscle it over the covers now. He's getting some loose deliveries and not letting them go anywhere but to the boundary;

14.4;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run length delivery outside off and swinging away, left alone easily;
14.3;6;Johnson to Anderson, SIX runs middles it this time and gets six! Expected the short ball, got the short ball and smoked it to the midwicket boundary to send it all the way;

6.4;4;Johnson to McCullum, FOUR runs he is ripping into his mate here! Another one targetted at the arm and another one swatted with utter disdain over the man at short fine;

4.5;?;Johnson to McCullum, no run length delivery on the middle stump, driven into the covers;
4.4;1;Johnson to Williamson, 1 run drives the length ball on off but gets an inside edge on the leg side for one;

3.5;W;Starc to Guptill, OUT taken at mid off, Guptill's gone! It was pitched up again, Guptill merely chipped it down the ground with a drive, maybe looking to clear mid off, but Cummins went to his right to complete a good catch;Martin Guptill c Cummins b Starc 11 (14b 1x4 1x6) SR: 78.57;

2.4;?;Johnson to McCullum, no run 147kmh, that was quick, hits him on the arm! The short ball on leg crammed Baz up, he made some room and had absolutely no time to react, and ended up taking it on the arm, very close to the elbow;
