Welcome back. Here we go, the huddles are over and we are ready to roll. It'll be Liam Plunkett to take the new ball. Mal Loye will not be taking the field after that blow to the jaw during his innings. Paul Collingwood substitutes.
Well, at long last we have a game on our hands between Australia and England. Ed Joyce, dropped on 6 by Shaun Tait, made his maiden hundred to help England to 292 for 7 as all the Australian bowlers struggled. The rate needed is 5.86 but the pitch looks good and this should be a very interesting chase. Join us 6.35pm (0735GMT) to see how they get on.
49.6;1;McGrath to Plunkett, 1 run yorker, well dug out towards extra cover and a single to end;

49.4;2;McGrath to Plunkett, 2 runs driven uppishly to long-off and Bopara runs well to the danger end for a second;
49.3;?;McGrath to Plunkett, no run short and Plunkett looks surprised that it was not called wide. He has a point, but as long as the umpires are consistent it doesn't matter;
49.2;1;McGrath to Bopara, 1 run full toss which Bopara looks to swing to leg, gets a leading edge and the ball hangs in the air before dropping feet in front of White racing in to mid-off;

35.6;1;McGrath to Joyce, 1 run short, pulled to deep midwicket;
35.5;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run this time he steps back and finds more room, punching it wide of cover to the man in the deep;
35.4;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run Flintoff cramped as he looks to thwack into the off and he can only push the ball to point;
35.3;1;McGrath to Joyce, 1 run same shot, but this time Joyce finds the gap and ambles a single as third man fields;

34.3;2;White to Joyce, 2 runs swept to deep square leg, good tag fielding on the rope from Bracken and Clarke;
34.2;?;White to Joyce, no run again pad, and this time a loud appeal as well. Nothing doing there, though;
34.1;?;White to Joyce, no run Joyce down the track and pads it back;
47.6;W;McGrath to Dalrymple, 1 run, OUT driven to long-on, the two players get in a real mess over the second and both end up at the bowler's end ... Dalrymple goes but surely Bopara should have sacrificed himself;Jamie Dalrymple run out (Clarke/?Gilchrist) 30 (27m 18b 3x4 1x6) SR: 166.66;

47.3;6;McGrath to Dalrymple, SIX runs yet again banged in but this time Dalrymple on it quickly and it goes all the way over midwicket ...it only just carries and it's dropped by the spectator leaning over the fence ...Tait's family enclosure?;

47.1;?;McGrath to Dalrymple, no run short and Dalrymple swings and misses;
46.6;W;Tait to Nixon, OUT another one banged in, and this time Nixon plays a really nothing semi-pull shot which lobs to extra cover. A short and certainly not sweet stay.;Paul Nixon c Hodge b Tait 4 (3m 2b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200;

46.3;?;Tait to Dalrymple, no run Dalrymple moves to leg, swishes and misses. That was 93mph (150kph) which is pretty remarkable at this stage with an old ball;
46.2;W;Tait to Joyce, OUT banged in, Joyce plays a tired pull which he doesn't get hold of and the ball loops to wide midwicket. A great ovation as he walks off. His innings has given England something to bowl at and also ensured that John Buchanan gets his wish of making sure Australia are in a game at last;Ed Joyce c Bracken b Tait 107 (201m 142b 10x4 0x6) SR: 75.35;

33.2;1;McGrath to Joyce, 1 run short again;
33.1;W;McGrath to Bell, OUT and the drinks break brings a breakthrough once again! And it's that old shark McGrath who does the job. It was short, Bell went for a big swing, and Gilchrist steadied himself under a big top-edge;Ian Bell c ?Gilchrist b McGrath 51 (96m 60b 4x4 0x6) SR: 85;
32.6;?;White to Joyce, no run;
32.5;?;White to Joyce, no run tighter now, after those loose early deliveries;

32.3;1;White to Bell, 1 run excellent rotation of the strike;
32.2;1;White to Joyce, 1 run;
32.1;1;White to Bell, 1 run driven down the ground, and that's Bell's fifty - his first against Australia. Well played;
32.1;1w;White to Bell, 1 wide loose again. Not good bowling;
32.1;3w;White to Bell, 3 wide loose again. Short, rank and leg-sided. Bell misses with his swing, but so does Gilchrist with his take;

44.5;1;Tait to Joyce, 1 run patted into the off side;
44.4;4;Tait to Joyce, FOUR runs Joyce aims a big heave-pull and gets it fine on the leg side. Warm applause from the crowd for his maiden ODI hundred and the fourth one-day hundred of his career;
44.3;1;Tait to Dalrymple, 1 run Tait follows Dalrymple as he moves to leg, but he still gets it into a gap;
44.2;1;Tait to Joyce, 1 run less impressive, slashed in the air a couple of yards short of the incoming third man;
44.1;4;Tait to Joyce, FOUR runs superb shot, gives himself room and creams that between midwicket and mid-on;
43.6;2;Clark to Dalrymple, 2 runs squirted to third man, a half appeal from Clark but more in frustration than expectation;

43.4;2;Clark to Dalrymple, 2 runs full toss patted to deep cover where Tait again makes a hash of some simple fielding. If he was trying to work his way out of a trip to the Caribbean he couldn't do a better job than he is today;

42.4;2;Bracken to Joyce, 2 runs angled bat and the ball is run to the left of third man, nice placement;
42.3;W;Bracken to Strauss, OUT well, not a dismissal you'll see in a Test. Strauss walks right across his stumps and scoops the ball to leg ... it goes straight up and Clark only has to move eight or nine yards at backward square leg to take a sitter;Andrew Strauss c Clark b Bracken 26 (25m 24b 3x4 0x6) SR: 108.33;
42.2;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run driven with real oomph past the bowler and deep mid-off fields well;
42.1;1;Bracken to Strauss, 1 run smacked to mid-on who is two-thirds of the way back;
41.6;1lb;Clark to Strauss, 1 leg bye pushed into the off side off his pads as Strauss nicks the strike;

41.4;1;Clark to Strauss, 1 run straight, Strauss, again on the walk, bat-pads it and keep running;
41.3;?;Clark to Strauss, no run pushed to Symonds at extra cover and ironic cheers as he stops it. Symonds scowls ..he certainly is not amused;
41.2;4;Clark to Strauss, FOUR runs two steps, one to leg, and that is crashed through cover and it races to the rope;
41.1;?;Clark to Strauss, no run wide and left alone;
40.6;2;Bracken to Joyce, 2 runs full toss driven at - and through -Symonds at extra cover. Ironic cheers from the crowd as Symonds looks as bewildered as a man whose pocket has just been picked;
40.5;1;Bracken to Strauss, 1 run flicked into the off side this time;
40.4;2;Bracken to Strauss, 2 runs Strauss steps to off and works to deep long-on ...good running and when they saw it was Tait in the deep they came back for the second;
40.3;?;Bracken to Strauss, no run tighter line and no run there;
40.2;4;Bracken to Strauss, FOUR runs full again, driven with timing and Hayden's dive at wide long-on is to no avail as his dive came too late and he carried the ball over with him;
40.1;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run fullish, dug out to midwicket;
39.6;1;Clark to Joyce, 1 run turned off his hips to midwicket;
39.5;4;Clark to Joyce, FOUR runs at last ...Joyce steps down the track and gives himself room to drive on the up over mid-off;
39.4;1;Clark to Strauss, 1 run driven to the sweeper;
39.3;1;Clark to Joyce, 1 run short, pulled but straight into the ground ... net result still a single, as it would have been had he middled it;
39.2;1;Clark to Strauss, 1 run ... and so Clark serves him one on the leg which he whips through midwicket;
39.1;?;Clark to Strauss, no run Strauss back, drops it at his feet and Clark scurries down the track to prevent any thoughts of a single;
38.6;2;White to Joyce, 2 runs steps back and plops it into the off;
38.5;1;White to Strauss, 1 run driven through the covers to the deep;

38.2;?;White to Joyce, no run chopped down into the pitch a few oohs as it bobbles close to the stumps;
38.1;1;White to Strauss, 1 run clipped into space on the leg;
38.1;1w;White to Strauss, 1 wide very wide outside off stump ... Stevie Wonder would have spotted that one;
37.6;1;McGrath to Strauss, 1 run cut off the top edge through the slips and Tait gets his body in the line at third man;
37.5;?;McGrath to Strauss, no run forward, he shapes to play at one leaving him outside off stump but changes his mind at the last moment and pulls out of the shot;
37.4;?;McGrath to Strauss, no run into the off side but not timed;
37.3;1;McGrath to Joyce, 1 run pushed into the leg side ... fielders converge but it's well placed and they can't prevent the single;
37.2;1;McGrath to Strauss, 1 run banged in, Strauss who was looking to come down the pitch, plays a rather hurried swat-pull, under control and down to long leg;
37.1;?;McGrath to Strauss, no run straight, Strauss defends solidly and correctly;
36.6;1;White to Strauss, 1 run clipped away into the leg side;
36.5;4;White to Strauss, FOUR runs confident start, short and he pulls through midwicket;
36.4;W;White to Flintoff, OUT Flintoff back, it hits him high up and the immediate thought was that it might have been going over the top. It pitched in line and was certainly straight ... is this the start of England's wobble?;Andrew Flintoff lbw b White 3 (12m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30;
36.3;2;White to Flintoff, 2 runs Flintoff works the ball to square leg, the man is right back and so they run two with some ease;

36.1;?;White to Joyce, no run Joyce fails to time an attempted swat into the off side;
31.6;?;Symonds to Joyce, no run down on the sweep again, and good contact as well. Nine off the over;

31.4;2;Symonds to Joyce, 2 runs clipped off the pads. Good batting;
31.3;2;Symonds to Joyce, 2 runs played through leg again. Some easy pickings at the moment;
31.2;1;Symonds to Bell, 1 run more good scampering brings up the hundred stand. Well played chaps;
31.1;4;Symonds to Bell, FOUR runs shot! Drifts onto the pads, and that's clipped up and over midwicket for another boundary;
30.6;?;White to Joyce, no run good finish, Joyce leaves alone outside off stump;
30.5;?;White to Joyce, no run clipped into the leg-side;
30.4;?;White to Joyce, no run Joyce plays for non-existent spin, and uncomfortably so;

30.2;?;White to Joyce, no run "bowled Barry!" says Gilchrist, and he's right;
30.1;?;White to Joyce, no run good start, nice flight, nice line;
29.6;1;Symonds to Joyce, 1 run the end of an eventful over, now here's Cameron White.;
29.5;2;Symonds to Joyce, 2 runs another miss! That was an inside-edge onto the pads, and it bobbled past Gilchrist! Lucky, lucky;
29.4;?;Symonds to Joyce, no run;
29.3;?;Symonds to Joyce, no run deflected behind square;
29.2;?;Symonds to Joyce, no run dropped! In the air to his left, and Symonds grabs with his weaker hand. That was a slower delivery, but he should have got it. And he's cross;
29.1;4;Symonds to Joyce, FOUR runs sweet strike through extra-cover! That was a gentle loosener, but Joyce cracked it almost one-handed on the up!;
28.6;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run another nudge towards the cordon. Steady stuff;
28.5;1;Bracken to Bell, 1 run pushed out to point;
28.4;?;Bracken to Bell, no run driven back down the ground, and that's quick work from Bracken! He fielded in his followthrough and Bell might have been out if his shy had hit;
28.3;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run drawn forward with a defensive push, finds the gap;
28.2;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run a swing and a miss to follow up - that was rash. Down the track and a big hoon over cow corner, but hit nothing but air;

27.6;?;Clarke to Bell, no run good ball to finish, line and length and maybe even some spin;
27.5;?;Clarke to Bell, no run leg-sided, misses out with a glance;
27.4;1;Clarke to Joyce, 1 run excellent running between these two. Another dab to third man;
27.3;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run;
27.2;3;Clarke to Bell, 3 runs reverse-sweep - or dab, rather, as he did nothing more than deflect the ball. Found the gap through backward square;
27.1;2;Clarke to Bell, 2 runs down on the sweep, and that's a thick inside-edge. Bit streaky, but gets away with it;
26.6;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run takes the pad, and that's the over;
26.5;2;Bracken to Joyce, 2 runs that's a lovely strike. Clip-driven, if you like, through midwicket all along the ground. Just picked up inside the rope;

25.4;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run fuller length, and defended;
25.3;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run down on one knee, and drilled over square leg. Not quite timed though, and swept up on the boundary's edge;

25.1;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run turned to midwicket;
24.6;2;Bracken to Bell, 2 runs clipped into the deep to complete the over;

23.1;?;Clarke to Bell, no run dabbed into the covers, and a scampered single;
22.6;?;Tait to Joyce, no run fuller but slightly off-line. Joyce can't get it away though;
22.5;?;Tait to Joyce, no run;
22.4;1;Tait to Bell, 1 run;
22.4;5w;Tait to Bell, 5 wide tried to follow up with the yorker, but that was sprayed down leg. Nice idea, poorly executed;
22.3;?;Tait to Bell, no run snorter! That was short, quick, straight, and vicious. Bell played it very well to be fair, watching closely and swaying out of line;
22.2;?;Tait to Bell, no run driven firmly but fielded in the followthrough by Tait;
22.1;2;Tait to Bell, 2 runs strays onto the pads, clipped away;
21.6;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run drifted across Joyce, and that was a bit of a loose waft. And he knows it;
21.5;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run good flight, calm defence;
21.4;?;Clarke to Joyce, no run clipped to leg;
21.3;1;Clarke to Bell, 1 run paddle-sweep to fine leg. Good measured shot;
21.2;?;Clarke to Bell, no run "nice Pup!" says Gilchrist, good line and length, and flight too;
21.1;1;Clarke to Joyce, 1 run starts with a gentle leg-stump half-volley. Clipped away;
20.6;1;Tait to Joyce, 1 run banged in, swung away. A useful over for England;
20.5;4;Tait to Joyce, FOUR runs that's a lovely strike from a man who's really starting to flourish now! Gave himself heaps of room by retreating to leg, and thwacked that through the covers. Nick Knight would be proud;
20.4;3;Tait to Bell, 3 runs fuller length, and nicely timed down the ground by Bell.;
20.3;1;Tait to Joyce, 1 run short and swung into the leg-side. Cleaned up on the square-leg boundary;
20.2;?;Tait to Joyce, no run outside off, driven without much power;
20.1;?;Tait to Joyce, no run good swinging full length. Maybe not as sharp as his first spell, but rapid nonetheless. Nothing has dropped below 90mph yet (144kph);

19.5;1;Clark to Joyce, 1 run defended with an angled bat to point. The batsmen rotate the strike again;

19.3;1;Clark to Joyce, 1 run slightly squared up, but safe;
19.2;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run another nudge into the gully, and a near-miss on that quick single. Joyce forgot that Clarke is left-handed in the field, and that might have been out if he had hit!;
19.1;?;Clark to Bell, no run good wheels, Stuey, good wheels. Right in the channel again;
18.6;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run attacking intent - down the pitch to meet McGrath, and a leading edge deflects through point;
18.5;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run tighter line, just back of a length. Joyce plays inside the line again;
18.4;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run width, and nudged down to third man;
18.3;1;McGrath to Joyce, 1 run quick single from a nudge into the gully. The shy was way off target though;

18.2;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run fuller, and drawn forward to defend;
18.1;?;McGrath to Bell, no run oooh! Sawn in half by a big nip-backer. Passed through bat and midriff;
17.6;?;Clark to Joyce, no run pushed into the covers to complete another tidy over;
17.5;?;Clark to Joyce, no run straighter, and defended back down the pitch;
17.4;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run width, and slapped past point;
17.3;2;Clark to Bell, 2 runs a fraction short, and Bell swings into a big ambitious pull over midwicket. Goes high, but well in front of the man in the deep. Decent shot;
17.2;?;Clark to Bell, no run line and length, respectfully defended;
17.1;?;Clark to Bell, no run turned to leg, another loud call stops the single;
16.6;4;McGrath to Joyce, FOUR runs lovely strike. McGrath is serving up far too many four-balls by his own high standards. Width again, and cracked past point for another boundary;
16.5;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run tries to turn this to leg, but slightly squared up;
16.4;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run probing stuff, played with an angled bat into the gully;
16.3;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run shorter and straighter - defended off the back foot to point, and a loud "No!";
16.2;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run again, good carry to the keeper from outside off stump. Joyce plays inside the line, as is his wont;
16.1;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run bit of nip again for McGrath - he's liking this track;
15.6;?;Clark to Bell, no run bit of a fish outside off stump that time! It bent away from the bat at the last minute, and Bell was tempted. Still, he lives on;
15.5;?;Clark to Bell, no run dropped in a touch short, and this one is defended into the gully;
15.4;1;Clark to Joyce, 1 run defended into the covers, and a scampered single;
15.3;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run width, and a measured carve through point;
15.2;4;Clark to Bell, FOUR runs lovely strike. Good stride and perfect placement, straight through extra cover;
15.1;?;Clark to Bell, no run good line and length to resume;
14.6;1;McGrath to Bell, 1 run outside off, and nudged down to third man;
14.5;?;McGrath to Bell, no run a bit of a squelch as this one nips back to hit Bell amidships. He's not fussed though. Balls of steel;
14.4;?;McGrath to Bell, no run shoulders arms again;
14.3;?;McGrath to Bell, no run width but left alone. Sensible batting;
14.3;1nb;McGrath to Bell, (no ball) better line and length this time. A loud "NO!";
14.2;4;McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs short and wide again! Strangely erratic from McGrath, and Bell - perhaps astonished to get two such rank balls in succession hits this harder and in the air in front of point!;
14.1;4;McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs short and wide and deservedly timed through the covers. Bell didn't try to hit that too hard, just placed it behind point. Well played;
13.6;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run attempted yorker, but easily driven out for a single to mid-on. Bell keeps the strike, which Australia might not mind too much;
13.5;?;Clark to Bell, no run that one fizzed through! Lots of oohs and aahs, but no real alarms for Bell;
13.4;?;Clark to Bell, no run on the money again. Defended into the covers;
13.3;?;Clark to Bell, no run wicket-to-wicket. Turned into the leg-side;
13.2;?;Clark to Bell, no run banged in a bit this time, but outside off again and left alone;
13.1;?;Clark to Bell, no run outside off stump once again. No great pace or movement;
12.6;4;McGrath to Joyce, FOUR runs shorter, and that's an excellent swivel-pull to dent McGrath's ego at the end of the over;
12.5;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run starts outside leg but nips back to take the thigh pad;
12.4;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run slightly wider but still in the channel. Left alone;

12.2;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run straighter and squared up as Joyce attempts to work to leg;
12.1;?;McGrath to Joyce, no run probing line, just back of a length and angling across the left-hander. Defended off the back foot;
11.6;?;Clark to Bell, no run drawn forward and played coolly into the covers. Solid over;
11.5;?;Clark to Bell, no run outside off stump and played on the up to cover;
11.4;?;Clark to Bell, no run just back of a length, defended with a loud "NO!";
11.3;1;Clark to Joyce, 1 run clipped off the pads and another stuttering single. These two won't have batted together very often;
11.2;?;Clark to Joyce, no run good length, and defended with a hint of inside-edge;
11.1;1;Clark to Bell, 1 run off the mark straight away, but a bit of hesitation there! Tickled to leg but safely home;
10.6;W;McGrath to Loye, OUT GOT HIM! McGrath dropped it short, as he was bound to do, and Loye tried to keep things positive by playing the hook. But it was a stroke played with no conviction, and a steepling top-edge ended in the hands of deep square-leg!;Mal Loye c Bracken b McGrath 29 (52m 33b 3x4 1x6) SR: 87.87;
10.5;?;McGrath to Loye, no run thunk! Good grief, down on the sweep, slight top-edge straight into the grille! McGrath looks as non-plussed as a fast bowler should when someone attempts to sweep them;
10.4;?;McGrath to Loye, no run excellent line and length this time, and some big seam movement back towards the stumps. Loye leaves alone with a flourish;
10.3;?;McGrath to Loye, no run straighter, and left alone;
10.3;1w;McGrath to Loye, 1 wide flashy flashy! It's that width again, and Loye just can't quite get it right with that shot. But it's too wide;
10.2;?;McGrath to Loye, no run same again. No pace, no movement, but just there;
10.1;?;McGrath to Loye, no run line and length, as you'd expect. Respectfully defended;
9.6;1;Clark to Loye, 1 run decent over for England;
9.6;1w;Clark to Loye, 1 wide wider, and Loye flinches in his eagerness to have a mow, but managed to restrain himself;
9.5;?;Clark to Loye, no run outside off, left alone;
9.4;3;Clark to Joyce, 3 runs fuller, but well timed through midwicket again. Clipped rather than carved though;
9.3;4;Clark to Joyce, FOUR runs short, and smeared through midwicket - that was a front-foot pull and it was hammered. Good batting;
9.2;?;Clark to Joyce, no run there's the intent. Joyce takes a couple of steps but defends nonetheless. Wasn't quite there for the shot;
9.1;?;Clark to Joyce, no run right on the money first up. Defended, but there's no swing;
8.6;4;Tait to Loye, FOUR runs much better shot, up towards the blockhole but swinging away. He didn't try to smack it, but it went like the proverbial through the covers all the same. When it's coming at you at 97mph, you don't need to have a mow!;
8.5;?;Tait to Loye, no run that's that tempter again, and Loye is drawn into it once again. Beaten by the swing, and just as well for his sake;
8.4;?;Tait to Loye, no run quick! Short and climbing at Loye, who fends this off his nose with a bit of discomfort;
8.3;?;Tait to Loye, no run slightly short, but rapid and Loye can't time his clip through leg;
8.2;1;Tait to Joyce, 1 run good yorker, squeezed out to the gully;
8.1;?;Tait to Joyce, no run 94.9mph that time, but nicely timed even though the direction was lacking. Steered into the gully off the back foot;
7.6;4;Bracken to Loye, FOUR runs no edges this time! That's a fine sweep, fizzes through square leg to complete an expensive over!;
7.5;4;Bracken to Loye, FOUR runs there's the sweep again! But this time it's a wild outside-edge that flies high over the slips. Still, it'll do;
7.4;1lb;Bracken to Joyce, 1 leg bye leg-sided again, clipped into space - in fact, it came off the pad but the intent was there;
7.3;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run shorter but straighter, and turned to leg with no great pace;
7.2;4;Bracken to Joyce, FOUR runs width, and smacked! That's a lovely shot - down the track, on the up, and over the covers;
7.1;1;Bracken to Loye, 1 run leg-side, and turned away for a quick single;
6.6;?;Tait to Joyce, no run right on the spot, swinging back towards off stump, and solidly pushed back up the pitch. Tidy stuff, and brutally quick as well!;
6.5;?;Tait to Joyce, no run swinging again, but a bit short and easily defended into the leg-side;
6.4;?;Tait to Joyce, no run yorker! And a good one too. Hastily dug out by Joyce;
6.3;?;Tait to Joyce, no run 96.1mph now, and that climbs past the left-hander's edge for Gilchrist to take above his head;
6.2;1;Tait to Loye, 1 run shorter, quicker, but defended on the hop into the vacant gully. 97mph that one, and Loye is shaking his finger, as well he might;
6.1;?;Tait to Loye, no run fancy that, it's a wide one, and he chased it!;
5.6;1;Bracken to Loye, 1 run back on a good length, and solidly defended;
5.5;6;Bracken to Loye, SIX runs there he goes! It's that slog-sweep again, and it's a big, big six again! Slight top-edge, but what power! Twelve rows back, I reckon;
5.4;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run fuller length, and pushed to leg;
5.3;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run tighter to the stumps and defended;
5.3;1w;Bracken to Joyce, 1 wide outside off, tight call, but that won't improve Bracken's mood;
5.2;2;Bracken to Joyce, 2 runs dropped! And that was a dolly. Joyce's first attacking move of the match, danced down the track, had a smear, and Tait at deep point fluffed a sitter;
5.1;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run a swish and a miss from Joyce - that was loose. Tempted by a hint of width, but good bounce and movement;
4.6;?;Tait to Loye, no run booming full-toss, Loye flings the bat but the outswing deceives him and he under-edges into the slips.;
4.5;2;Tait to Loye, 2 runs nicely timed through square leg, bit of a half-volley this time but Tait is finding a good rhythm after that erratic first over;
4.4;2;Tait to Loye, 2 runs attempted yorker, 90mph-plus but no movement, and easily squeezed to square leg;
4.3;?;Tait to Loye, no run speared down the leg-side, takes the pad but Gilchrist runs round to field;
4.2;?;Tait to Loye, no run right up to the bat, hint of movement and watchfully defended back up the pitch;
4.1;?;Tait to Loye, no run banged in, takes the glove and dribbles into the covers. Good aggression;
3.6;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run excellent over. Joyce defends into the covers;
3.5;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run straighter, and this time Joyce is forced to defend. Drawn onto the front foot;
3.4;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run outside off stump once again, Joyce shoulders arms once again;
3.3;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run good discipline from Bracken.;
3.2;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run probing, probing. No stroke again as the ball sits in the channel outside off stump;
3.1;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run fizzes through, no stroke offered;
2.6;?;Tait to Loye, no run right up to the bat, and an inside-edge bobbles into the crease as Loye drives again. Better over;
2.5;?;Tait to Loye, no run good pace again, Loye drawn into the drive, but controls his aggression;
2.5;1w;Tait to Loye, 1 wide 95mph, but misdirected, and slips past Loye's ribs for another extra;
2.4;?;Tait to Loye, no run fuller, outside off, and squirted to gully. Rapid;
2.3;?;Tait to Loye, no run big appeal from Tait, but that looked to be sliding down leg. Loye was well squared up though. Hawkeye disagrees ...;
2.2;2;Tait to Loye, 2 runs starts on middle-and-leg, decent swing again, but easily clipped to midwicket;
2.1;?;Tait to Loye, no run big booming outswing from Tait. Useful pace as well. Loye leaves alone;

David Partridge asks: "Is it true the Swans booked a training session at the SCG tonight on hearing England are batting?" Cruel but fair.
 Innings Start
That's it from us today. We've been Andrew Miller and Martin Williamson. Thanks for bearing with us through our technical glitches. Join us then from 0300 GMT on Sunday for the showdown between Australia and New Zealand at Melbourne.
Okay, so Australia had their foot off the pedal and their eyes on bigger contests, but it was still a worthy performance nonetheless. It was set up by Ed Joyce's maiden ODI century, and sealed by some tidy bowling from Liam Plunkett in particular.
Andrew Symonds will not bat, and so England, believe it or not, have achieved the unachievable, and beaten Australia by the hefty margin of 92 runs! That even means a bonus point, to put a teeny bit of pressure on the Kiwis ...
38.5;W;Plunkett to Clark, OUT Bell has sealed it with a run-out! Pushed on to the back foot, Tait was slow to start running, and Bell swooped from cover to ping down the stumps!;Shaun Tait run out (Bell) 11 (6m 10b 1x4 1x6) SR: 110;
38.4;?;Plunkett to Clark, no run full on off stump this time, pushed out to cover;
38.3;1lb;Plunkett to Tait, 1 leg bye turned to fine leg to bring up the 200;
38.2;?;Plunkett to Tait, no run backing away, and squared up as well, all in the same shot. A good old-fashioned tail-end tangle;
38.1;?;Plunkett to Tait, no run pushed onto the back foot again. Played out to cover;
37.6;?;Panesar to Clark, no run drawn onto the front foot, and defended into the gully.;
37.5;1;Panesar to Tait, 1 run slapped out to cover point;
37.4;?;Panesar to Tait, no run beaten outside off stump, though he was swinging hard;
37.3;6;Panesar to Tait, SIX runs and so was that, with knobs on! VAST six, slapped way, way over cow corner! That was tossed up at less than 100kph (56mph). He might spear the rest in;
37.2;4;Panesar to Tait, FOUR runs mowed down the ground! That was a good old-fashioned tail-end biff!;
37.1;1;Panesar to Clark, 1 run full length and flashed just wide of Andrew Strauss at short midwicket;
36.6;?;Plunkett to Tait, no run retreats to leg again, and edged down to the gully;
36.5;?;Plunkett to Tait, no run pushed onto the back foot, played out to cover;
36.4;?;Plunkett to Tait, no run good line and length;
36.3;W;Plunkett to McGrath, OUT GONE! McGrath steps across his stumps, Plunkett raps him on the kneeroll, Harper raises his finger. Easy as pie, and England are almost home and hosed!;Glenn McGrath lbw b Plunkett 1 (10m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;
36.2;?;Plunkett to McGrath, no run outside off stump again, McGrath fishes and misses;
36.1;?;Plunkett to McGrath, no run appreciation from Nixon as the ball thuds into his gloves;
35.6;4;Panesar to Clark, FOUR runs shot! A firm thud over midwicket, and Panesar has leaked another boundary off the last ball of the over;
35.5;1;Panesar to McGrath, 1 run off the mark to huge applause from his Sydney faithful!;
35.4;?;Panesar to McGrath, no run watchfully defended;

35.2;1;Panesar to Clark, 1 run drifting onto the pads, and clipped square;
35.1;?;Panesar to Clark, no run "bowling Monty ...";
34.6;?;Flintoff to McGrath, no run outside off stump and McGrath watches it go by;
34.5;1;Flintoff to Clark, 1 run nice shot, stepped inside the line to clip a leg-stump delivery out to square leg;
34.4;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run short and straight, but doesn't get up so much. Clark sways out of line again and steers to gully;
34.3;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run fuller length again, driven without power back to the bowler;
34.2;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run short and sharp. Clark sways out of line to waft an attempted cut;
34.1;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run full length, maybe a touch of reverse swing, dug out to the covers;
33.6;W;Panesar to Bracken, OUT beautiful ball! Tossed right up, much much slower, and Bracken played all round it as the ball crashed into middle and leg. Another one bites the dust, and with Glenn McGrath now at the crease, it's safe to say the game is up. Or is it?;Nathan Bracken b Panesar 21 (34m 26b 3x4 0x6) SR: 80.76;
33.5;?;Panesar to Bracken, no run back on a better line and length. Deadbatted;
33.4;4;Panesar to Bracken, FOUR runs that's too short and wide from Panesar, and that's a firm thud through the covers. Australia haven't given up here;
33.3;1;Panesar to Clark, 1 run clipped into the leg-side. Tight bowling again;
33.2;1;Panesar to Bracken, 1 run straighter, and turned fine;
33.1;?;Panesar to Bracken, no run a little short, but an attempted cut is mistimed and bobbles out to cover;
32.6;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run good ball to finish, fizzes past the edge again;
32.5;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run drawn onto the front foot. Smothered defence;
32.4;4;Flintoff to Clark, FOUR runs short again, but that's cut and cut hard to the backward point boundary. Well played;
32.3;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run lovely follow-up - flashes past the edge from just back of a length;
32.2;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run bouncer! And that's the one for the over;
32.1;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run in the channel of off stump. Tight, constrictive stuff;
31.6;4;Panesar to Bracken, FOUR runs he got that one wrong, and is annoyed with himself. A fraction short, and flashed to the boundary!;

30.2;1;Flintoff to Clark, 1 run flashed up and over cover;
30.1;W;Flintoff to White, OUT Flintoff strikes with his first ball of the new spell! A hint of width tempted White into a rash swipe, and Nixon makes no mistake! England are right into the elongated tail;Cameron White c ?Nixon b Flintoff 13 (25m 20b 0x4 0x6) SR: 65;
29.6;1;Panesar to White, 1 run tidy over from Panesar, a leg-glance to finish;
29.5;?;Panesar to White, no run;

29.3;?;Panesar to White, no run tossed up, driven back to the bowler;
29.2;2;Panesar to White, 2 runs driven down the ground. Good air from Panesar though;

28.5;?;Bopara to Bracken, no run good riposte, beaten outside off stump;
28.4;4;Bopara to Bracken, FOUR runs shot! Full and outswinging. Bracken plays it on length and larrups it through the covers;
28.3;1;Bopara to White, 1 run onto the back foot and turned square;
28.2;2;Bopara to White, 2 runs hint of outswing, firmly driven through the covers. Plunkett on the boundary makes a meal of his elaborate fielding. Still, it's vastly improved to his efforts last week;
28.1;?;Bopara to White, no run fizzes past the off stump, well bowled again;
27.6;?;Panesar to Bracken, no run inside-edge onto the pads. Good areas, Monty;

26.4;?;Bopara to Bracken, no run sharp and tight, lively stuff;
26.3;?;Bopara to Bracken, no run a big appeal but that was sliding down leg. Good wicket-to-wicket bowling though;

26.1;1;Bopara to White, 1 run inside-edged to square leg;
25.6;1;Panesar to White, 1 run tossed up, driven into the covers, a bit of a fumble and they come through for the single;

24.6;?;Bopara to Bracken, no run great over from Bopara. This boy's got a bit about him with the ball;
24.5;?;Bopara to Bracken, no run lovely ball! Hits the seam and fizzes past the edge. A pat of appreciation from Bell;
24.4;W;Bopara to Hussey, OUT beautiful ball! Hits the seam, bounces sharply and cramps Hussey for room, and he chops it onto his stumps! That could well be game, set and match!;Michael Hussey b Bopara 6 (20m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85;
24.3;?;Bopara to Hussey, no run tight bowling, a hint of swing;
24.2;1;Bopara to White, 1 run nudged into the covers to get off the mark;
24.2;5w;Bopara to White, 5 wide bouncer from Bopara, but Nixon was standing up to the stumps ... so he had no chance. Still, White's not wearing a helmet, so he's asking for it really;
24.1;1;Bopara to Hussey, 1 run;
23.6;1;Panesar to Hussey, 1 run tidy stuff from Panesar. Shambolic stuff from ... ahem ... us. But ho hum, what can we do? Sorry about all this;Andrew Symonds retired hurt 39 (64m 35b 4x4 1x6) SR: 111.42;
23.5;1;Panesar to Symonds, 1 run good trading of singles;

22.4;2lb;Bopara to Hussey, 2 leg byes;
22.3;1;Bopara to Symonds, 1 run;
22.2;?;Bopara to Symonds, no run nice line and length, and quite possibly sharper than he looks as well. Defended;
22.1;?;Bopara to Symonds, no run skiddy swingy stuff from Bopara, and there's a call for a replay as Nixon whips the bails off. Not out, but sharp work nonetheless;
21.6;?;Panesar to Hussey, no run tidy stuff, turned to midwicket to complete a fine over;
21.5;1;Panesar to Symonds, 1 run another nudged single, down to long-on;
21.4;?;Panesar to Symonds, no run;
21.3;?;Panesar to Symonds, no run on a good length, gentle turn but tight line. Pushed back to the bowler;
21.2;1;Panesar to Hussey, 1 run clipped back down the track, wide of a diving Panesar for another single;
21.1;1;Panesar to Symonds, 1 run pushed insouciantly down the ground. The batsmen jog a leisurely single;
20.6;?;Mahmood to Hussey, no run Hussey still not off the mark, and that's the end of an important over;
20.5;?;Mahmood to Hussey, no run full and swinging onto off stump. Squirted to gully;
20.4;W;Mahmood to Hayden, OUT there's the breakthrough! And it's that man on the drive who does the trick. Lots of width from Mahmood, Hayden went for a big booming drive and it's a smart reflex take from Jamie Dalrymple at short cover! Not the best ball, but the best result as far as England are concerned;Matthew Hayden c Dalrymple b Mahmood 51 (103m 62b 7x4 1x6) SR: 82.25;
20.4;1w;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 wide short and wild down the leg-side. Symonds flexes some more;
20.3;1;Mahmood to Symonds, 1 run something's not right about Symonds' bicep. I think he's tweaked it playing that last carve over point;
20.2;4;Mahmood to Symonds, FOUR runs thumped over point! Gave himself room and threw the kitchen sink at that. A one-bounce four, inches inside the rope;
20.1;1;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run too much width, and that's carved down to third man;
19.6;1;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run and that's Matthew Hayden's fifty. Well batted. Slow at first, but increasingly brutal;
19.5;1;Flintoff to Symonds, 1 run crikey - this is too exciting. Right, massive apologies for all the nonsense just gone by. We are back up and running. I hope ...;

15.5;2;Flintoff to Hayden, 2 runs inside edge onto the pads and they scamper through for a single, Flintoff moves across and tries to kick the ball on to the stumps but misses the traget;
15.4;4;Flintoff to Hayden, FOUR runs four more! another massive cut and the ball screams away to the point fence;

11.5;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run left alone again. Lots of dot balls;
11.4;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run still no shot being offered. Good disciplined line and length;
11.3;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run better line. Much tighter to off stump, and Hayden shoulders arms;

11.1;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run outside off and left alone again;
10.6;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run better line and length. Fuller and straighter, and defended;
10.5;4;Plunkett to Clarke, FOUR runs that one went wrong for Plunkett. Dragged down, wide of off stump, and flailed over point;
10.4;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run thick outside edge to gully. Plunkett is struggling a bit with his action, but he's persevering;

10.2;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run good delivery - fuller and bends round the edge of Clarke's bat. Six of those an over would suit England;
10.2;1w;Plunkett to Clarke, 1 wide a bit of an appeal there from Nixon, but umpire Harper isn't won over. Another wide!;
10.1;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run short and outside off, steered into the gully;
9.6;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run ooh, a bit lucky there! A leading edge looped up in the air, but Flintoff couldn't get there in time;
9.5;1;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 run driven firmly to mid-off. Ricochets off Mahmood's knee but good old Monty is on hand to clean up;
9.4;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run defended out to midwicket;
9.3;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run left alone outside off. Better line this time;
9.3;1w;Flintoff to Hayden, 1 wide down the leg-side. These extras are adding up;
9.2;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run on the pads but clipped to midwicket with no great power;
9.1;?;Flintoff to Hayden, no run;
8.6;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run fuller and pushed back down the ground;
8.5;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run width, and steered to a tumbling gully;
8.5;1w;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 wide strays down leg;
8.4;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run fuller, and defended into the covers. That's a better length;
8.3;1lb;Plunkett to Clarke, 1 leg bye flicked round the corner, and another quick single;
8.2;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run outside off stump, left alone again;
8.1;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run short, and Clarke turns turtle. Nixon gathers high above his head;
7.6;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run looking again, but nothing doing. Defended back down the ground;
7.5;4;Mahmood to Hayden, FOUR runs thwack! A couple of steps and whipped through midwicket with a lot of bottom hand. Bounces just inside the rope. Good selective batting;
7.4;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run good discipline. Hayden comes forward and pushes this to cover;
7.3;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run floated up to a yorker length, dug out well;
7.2;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run fuller and straighter, Hayden gets everything behind it and pushes out to midwicket;
7.1;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run outside off again. Left alone again;
6.6;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run that's the spot. Fuller, straighter, and swinging late. Clarke is properly beaten;
6.5;1;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 run short again, and helped down to fine leg;
6.4;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run a fraction fuller, but still not tempting the stroke. That glorious first delivery seems a bit distant now;
6.3;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run outside off stump, and left alone;
6.2;1;Plunkett to Clarke, 1 run too short again. Clarke pushes into the covers and sets off at once. Bell at cover shies underarm but misses;
6.1;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run short but straight. Defended into the gully;
5.6;?;Mahmood to Hayden, no run fuller and wider, Hayden drives but short cover fields well and threatens a shy at the non-striker's end;
5.5;2;Mahmood to Hayden, 2 runs and now leg-sided to the left-hander as well. Too short too, and clipped square;
5.4;3;Mahmood to Clarke, 3 runs too straight, and angling onto the legs, clipped very firmly to deep midwicket, where Panesar fields just inside the rope;
5.3;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run shoulders arms once again. Cagey stuff from Australia so far;
5.2;2;Mahmood to Clarke, 2 runs beats the infield with a firm push through the covers;
5.1;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run decent line and length, but Clarke's not troubled;
4.6;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run less threatening now. Too short and too wide, but Hayden's not tempted;
4.5;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run a bit wider, but still no shot offered;
4.4;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run carbon copy of the last two balls. Plunkett's using his height well, and Hayden leaves alone;
4.3;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run good probing stuff. There's some nice trampoline bounce for the seamers outside off stump;
4.2;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run back of a length but straighter and swinging back in. Left alone;
4.1;3;Plunkett to Clarke, 3 runs that's gone fine as well, and Monty Panesar produces a sprawling fumbled stop at fine leg to cut off the boundary. There's no faulting his effort;
3.6;4;Mahmood to Hayden, FOUR runs and that's gone too fine for Read at fine leg to cut off. Another boundary and Hayden's first;
3.5;1;Mahmood to Clarke, 1 run strays in line again;
3.4;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run pushed into the covers;
3.3;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run right back and into line;
3.2;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run left alone. Clarke needs to be watchful;
3.1;1;Mahmood to Hayden, 1 run drifts onto the legs, and clipped down to fine leg - where the substitute Chris Read fields! Blimey, we'd forgotten he was still here!;
2.6;4;Plunkett to Clarke, FOUR runs excellently timed off the legs. Panesar at fine leg can't cut that off and that's Australia's first boundary of the innings;
2.5;?;Plunkett to Clarke, no run sharp pace, nips away late;
2.4;1lb;Plunkett to Hayden, 1 leg bye drifting down leg, and deflects away for a single;
2.3;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run;
2.2;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run good length - slightly fuller;

1.5;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run;
1.4;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run good discipline;
1.3;?;Mahmood to Clarke, no run straighter this time. Pushed back down the pitch;
1.3;1w;Mahmood to Clarke, 1 wide oops, wide and wider;
1.2;W;Mahmood to Hodge, OUT GOTTIM! Well, well, what a start from England! Shorter and straighter, Hodge tried to leave alone but it was onto him too quickly and a big inside-edge deflected onto his middle stump!;Brad Hodge b Mahmood 1 (8m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
1.2;1w;Mahmood to Hodge, 1 wide erratic - started outside off and swung further away;
1.1;?;Mahmood to Hodge, no run full in length, bit of movement, clipped square;
0.6;?;Plunkett to Hayden, no run good line, shorter in length, Hayden lets it swing by. Excellent first over;
0.5;1;Plunkett to Hodge, 1 run first runs off the bat, pushed into the covers;
0.5;1w;Plunkett to Hodge, 1 wide that's a harsh call. And Nixon behind the stumps mutters his indignation;
0.5;1w;Plunkett to Hodge, 1 wide too much swing that time, and rightly called wide. But this is encouraging for England;
0.4;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run more handy swing, but started wider this time. Feisty first over so far;
0.3;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run ripper! Late boomeranging movement and that hoops round the edge of the bat. No foot movement there;
0.2;?;Plunkett to Hodge, no run signs of swing for Plunkett, though this one is shorter in length and outside off;
0.1;W;Plunkett to Gilchrist, OUT what a start! Brilliant, brilliant delivery from Plunkett. Full, fast, inswinging, perfect yorker length, and Gilchrist has no answer whatsoever! Well, well ... England are on a roll!;Adam Gilchrist b Plunkett 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

Here comes Brad Hodge - his last chance to impress before the World Cup? Probably. What a situation to come into
There's an extra catcher at gully
