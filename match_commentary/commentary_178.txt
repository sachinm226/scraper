Data
12.50pm Only once has a team lost a Test after scoring 400 or more in an innings at the WACA. For those in the UK, meanwhile, here is the moment Jonny Bairstow brought up an emotional hundred.
Another tidbit: Austin Waugh, son of Steve, and Will Sutherland, son of CA chief executive James Sutherland, have been picked in Australia's squad for the Under-19 World Cup
12.40pm Phew, that escalated quickly. After not losing a wicket in the post-tea session on the first day, England have lost 6 for 35.. Before that collapse, YJB reached his fourth Test hundred and added 237 for the fifth wicket with Malan - the highest stand for England v Australia in Tests. Alan will be back for the start of the post-lunch session. Cheers
115.1;W;Starc to Broad, OUT Starc bounces out Broad and wraps up England for 403. Broad ventures a long way across the off stump and aims to hook it over to long leg. Instead, he cue-ends a catch to forward short leg;Stuart Broad c Bancroft b Starc 12 (22m 10b 0x4 1x6) SR: 120;
114.6;?;Hazlewood to Anderson, no run low full-toss on off, jabbed back to the bowler;
114.5;?;Hazlewood to Anderson, no run Anderson keeps moving across off, he misses the glance, and the ball bounces over leg stump;
114.4;?;Hazlewood to Anderson, no run dug short and down leg, Anderson, having ventured across off, runs it away fine. Paine dives to his right and makes another superb stop;
114.3;1;Hazlewood to Broad, 1 run Broad takes on the short ball and hooks away to long leg;
114.2;6;Hazlewood to Broad, SIX runs Broad has a big yahooooo at it and sends the ball sailing past square leg and the score past 400. He steps away outside leg and swings it over the boundary. Was it top edged? Broad would say he nailed Hazlewood over the fence;
114.1;?;Hazlewood to Broad, no run Broad slinks outside leg, uppercuts and misses, as this one soars over the stumps;
113.6;?;Starc to Anderson, no run head-hunting short ball, angling away, Anderson yanks his head away;
113.5;?;Starc to Anderson, no run Anderson moves across off even before Starc delivers. Short and outside leg, left alone;
113.4;?;Starc to Anderson, no run Anderson wanders across off, Starc sprays it down leg, past the bat;
113.3;?;Starc to Anderson, no run ooooh, Jimmy shuffles across off and nearly fends it back onto his stumps. Short, curving away, he fends it just wide as the ball trickles square past the leg stump;
113.2;3;Starc to Broad, 3 runs Broad backs away outside leg and exposes all three stumps. Starc goes outside off, Broad hits it over the top. Lifted over extra cover. Lyon chases, Broad takes three and exposes Jimmy to Starc. Not a great idea from Broad;
113.1;?;Starc to Broad, no run back of a length, angling away from over the wicket, ducking away past the outside edge;
112.6;W;Hazlewood to Overton, OUT Fire and brimstone at the WACA! Accurate short ball, just over the chest, Overton sits back and aims to fend it off. Instead, he only loops it off the glove to Bancroft under the helmet short leg;Craig Overton c Bancroft b Hazlewood 2 (13m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57;
112.5;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run short and homing in at the head of Overton, he avoids it;
112.4;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run rising short ball outside off, patted down to cover;
112.3;1;Hazlewood to Broad, 1 run glanced in the air but to the left of a diving Bancroft at short leg;
112.2;?;Hazlewood to Broad, no run chest-high short ball on middle, Broad hops and fends it down;
112.1;?;Hazlewood to Broad, no run more sweet-chin music, shuffles across off and prods it wide of short leg. Think it did not carry to Bancroft there;
111.6;?;Starc to Overton, no run back of a length and skidding across off, Overton tucks his bat inside the line and lets it go again;
111.5;?;Starc to Overton, no run back of a length, bounces, and screams away. The batsman tucks his bat inside the line;
111.4;2;Starc to Overton, 2 runs pitched up and outside off, tentatively pushed through the covers;
111.3;1;Starc to Broad, 1 run short and angling away, has Broad hopping, and fending wide of short leg;
111.2;W;Starc to Bairstow, OUT Starc returns and floors the middle stump. This is pretty full - not quite a yorker - and jags back in. Bairstow aims for a leg-side flick, but doesn't account for the inward movement. The ball takes the inside edge and rattles the stumps. England have lost four wickets in six overs. Nonetheless, excellent innings from YJB;Jonny Bairstow b Starc 119 (319m 215b 18x4 0x6) SR: 55.34;
111.1;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run good length ball on middle, he covers up in defence;
110.6;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run dug in on middle, Overton camps back and fends it off;
110.5;W;Hazlewood to Woakes, OUT Cummins runs in from long leg dives forward to snap up a smart catch. Good change-up from Hazlewood: he follows up a very full ball with a shorter one on the hips. Woakes shapes for a flick-pull but ends up flapping a catch to the man in the deep. Make that three wickets in five overs;Chris Woakes c Cummins b Hazlewood 8 (17m 12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
110.4;4;Hazlewood to Woakes, FOUR runs pitched up and outside off, right up Woakes' alley. He leans out and creams a drive through the covers. So easy on the eye;
110.3;1;Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 run back of a length and straighter in line, tucked to deep midwicket;
110.2;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run back of a length on off, punched off the front foot to cover;
110.1;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run dug in short and angling in just a shade outside off, YJB bails out of the hook;
69.6;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run pitched up and clouted towards cover, half-stopped on the dive and they think better of chancing a run;
69.5;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run banged in short, snaking bouncer but Bairstow avoids being bitten as he leans back;
69.4;1;Cummins to Malan, 1 run pitched up and driven with a flourish to the cover sweeper;
69.3;?;Cummins to Malan, no run length, 137kph but slightly wide and he leaves alone;
69.2;4;Cummins to Malan, FOUR runs short and slashed, room to swing the arms and Malan gleefully steers it past gully, in the air but out of reach of the diving Khawaja;
69.1;?;Cummins to Malan, no run pitched up and defended on off stump;
68.6;1;Lyon to Malan, 1 run tossed up and met coming forwards for one more down the ground to long-off;
68.5;?;Lyon to Malan, no run flighted on off, Malan covers the line and pushes back to the bowler;
68.4;1;Lyon to Bairstow, 1 run tossed up worked into a gap on the leg side;
68.3;1;Lyon to Malan, 1 run floated up a touch wider and punched to cover;
68.2;4;Lyon to Malan, FOUR runs smoothly done, Malan skips down and laces a drive to the long-on boundary - and like Stoneman, he's got a new Test best today, too;
68.1;1;Lyon to Bairstow, 1 run flighted, over the wicket and spinning in, worked around the corner and they trot one;
67.6;?;Cummins to Malan, no run fullish, targeting that tricky zone, Malan gets into it and defends to mid-on;
67.5;?;Cummins to Malan, no run comes across and defends a back-of-a-length ball, 135kph and tapped square;
67.4;?;Cummins to Malan, no run hammered in short and soaring through to smack the keeper's gloves;
67.3;?;Cummins to Malan, no run length outside off, 136kph and poked cautiously behind square;
67.2;?;Cummins to Malan, no run testing line again, fading in from wide of the stumps, left alone;
67.1;?;Cummins to Malan, no run huge shout from Cummins, bringing the ball back sharply to smash into the pads... Erasmus declines the appeal but, after a fair amount of discussion, Smith decides to review. Looked like he might have been across outside off, plus height may be an issue with the WACA bounce - but let's see. No bat involved, so it's on to Hawk-Eye: which has impact "umpire's call" and the ball going over the stumps. So Malan survives and Australia lose a review;
66.6;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run fullish on the stumps, Bairstow turns the ball towards midwicket;
66.5;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run touch short, 139kph and worked down to the leg side;
66.4;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run good length, blocked into the off side;
66.3;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run slammed in short, 140kph but a touch leg side, ducked;
66.2;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run full and he pings a drive into the covers, where Bancroft throws himself on it and prevents a run;
66.1;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run back over the wicket, full and a touch wide, Bairstow chops down on a drive and it runs towards mid-off;
65.6;?;Cummins to Malan, no run another bumper, this flies through at head height with Malan well down;
65.5;?;Cummins to Malan, no run short ball, at the body but Malan does well, thinks about playing but then gets out of the way;
65.4;?;Cummins to Malan, no run gets into line on off and defends;
65.3;?;Cummins to Malan, no run back of a length, super ball and it's through him again - but did it kiss the edge? Paine's reaction was the giveaway, as he took a tumbling catch, looks like it flicked the back leg... Very similar to a couple of Malan's dismissals in the series so far against Cummins;
65.2;2;Cummins to Malan, 2 runs touch straight, worked into the leg side for a couple;
65.1;?;Cummins to Malan, no run Malan comes across and pushes to the on side;
64.6;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run comes across his stumps and defends;
64.5;4;Starc to Bairstow, FOUR runs and now Starc goes too straight and YJB gets his reward for abstinence to the previous ball, whipped off the pads and Cummins won't catch it;
64.4;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run very full, 140kph and tailing away late as Bairstow holds himself from playing the drive, as he wanted to;
64.3;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run dug in short, head-hunting bouncer but Bairstow is down out of the way;
64.2;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run full outside off, YJB steps out to drive without timing to cover;
64.1;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run round the wicket, good length on off, 140kph and defended;
63.6;4;Hazlewood to Malan, FOUR runs full and spanked, Malan threads the gap again, beats extra cover and mid-off won't catch that. Handsome stuff;
63.5;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run shuffles into line on off stumps and defends towards his toes;
63.4;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run back of a length on fourth-fifth stump and Malan lets it go;
63.3;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run angled across on a shortish length, 140kph and defended towards backward point;
63.2;1;Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 run pitched up on off and driven, they're aided by a misfield in stealing one;
63.1;4;Hazlewood to Bairstow, FOUR runs Hazlewood strays, this is meat and potatoes to most Test batsmen, he's standing outside leg and cracks it to the midwicket fence;
62.6;2;Starc to Malan, 2 runs full in the channel, Malan chops down on a drive and they pick up two through cover;
62.5;1;Starc to Bairstow, 1 run on the pads, clipped unfussily down to fine leg, that raises the England 200 - well done, them;
62.4;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run bangs in the bouncer, YJB crouches deep in his crease;
62.3;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run this swirls away as he ploughs into the breeze, 137kph and left alone as it zips through to Paine;
62.2;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run good length and shaping in to Bairstow, who blocks;
62.1;1;Starc to Malan, 1 run pitched up, hint of swing away, 139kph and driven into the ground, bobbling wide of cover for one;
61.6;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run over the wicket, pitched up and steered to backward point with an open bat face;
61.5;1;Hazlewood to Malan, 1 run fuller, sliding into the pads at 138kph and flicked through square to one of the sweepers;
61.4;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run good length around off stump, defended;
61.3;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run goes full on off, maybe a touch of reverse swing but Malan covers it and clips stylishly towards mid-on, who dives to cut it off;
61.3;1nb;Hazlewood to Malan, (no ball) hurled down on off stump, 140kph... but he's overstepped, striving for that extra yard;
61.2;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run fuller and prodded back to the on side;
61.1;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run round the wicket, back of a length and it hurries Malan as he plays across the line, hit on the thigh and it balloons towards point;
60.6;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run full and flighted on the stumps, tapped away;
60.5;4;Lyon to Bairstow, FOUR runs tossed up and he drives against the spin, eased down the ground, wide of mid-off and Starc's slide fails to cut the ball off, it then outruns his second diving effort as he ends up eating boundary marker;
60.4;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run on the stumps and clipped towards midwicket;
60.3;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run flighted, bit slower this time, goes back and taps to leg;

60.1;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run pushed through wide of off stump and Bairstow leaves;
59.6;?;Cummins to Malan, no run slightly full and defended into the off side as he comes across;
59.5;?;Cummins to Malan, no run good length, too wide from Cummins again, though;
59.4;?;Cummins to Malan, no run banged in, 139kph and rising as Malan stops, drops and rolls;
59.3;?;Cummins to Malan, no run tighter line and this time he defends;
59.2;4;Cummins to Malan, FOUR runs oh, yes, I'll have a slice of that... overpitched by Cummins and the ball is larruped through the covers, despite some protection on that side, one of the shots of the day;
59.1;?;Cummins to Malan, no run fullish but wide of the stumps and Malan leaves it be;
58.6;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run over the wicket, pushed through outside off and cut towards backward point;
58.5;1;Lyon to Malan, 1 run tossed up on off, comes forward and prods a single through mid-off - that's the fifty, quick raise of the bat from Malan. Fourth time he's got there in Tests, England need him to convert this one;
58.4;?;Lyon to Malan, no run pushed through, bit of drop and Malan punches back to the bowler;
58.3;1;Lyon to Bairstow, 1 run floated up, slightly too full and YJB clips it off his toes to deep midwicket;

57.6;1;Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run angled in and flicked fine for another single;
57.5;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run oof, well-directed bouncer but it's well played, down on one knee and moving his head out of the way. Shades of the "Judge", Robin Smith, smelling the leather on its way through;
57.4;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run sliding and worked away through square leg for a couple, Bairstow head down and scurrying off straight away;
57.3;2;Cummins to Bairstow, 2 runs YJB shifts across, makes a forward movement and then throws up his hands to allow the ball through;
57.2;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run full again, on middle stump and driven, the bat turns in the hands slightly and the ball rolls to mid-on;
57.1;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run full and tailing in a fraction as Bairstow dinks a drive back to Cummins in his follow through;
56.6;?;Lyon to Malan, no run tossed up and Malan punches back down the track again, Lyon grabs it;
56.5;4;Lyon to Malan, FOUR runs short and cut, Malan makes room on the back foot and lashes the ball to deep backward point;
56.4;1;Lyon to Bairstow, 1 run tossed up and jabbed past short leg, shout of "catch!" from Lyon but not sure it carried and would have been an superb instinctive take if Bancroft had got there;
56.3;1;Lyon to Malan, 1 run uses the feet now and breaks the wrists the clip a single through the leg side;
56.2;?;Lyon to Malan, no run flighted from round the wicket, tucked to leg;

53.5;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run fullish outside off and YJB leaves alone once more;
53.4;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run pitched up now, 139kph in the channel, not much in the way of lateral movement - although that's not what has caused most of the issues today - and left alone;
53.3;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run comes across and defends on off;
53.2;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run touch short again and this is chopped towards point on the back foot, "wait on!" bellows YJB;
53.1;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run slightly back of a length outside off, 134kph and Bairstow raises his bat out of the way;
52.6;?;Lyon to Malan, no run Did the carry to Bancroft at forward short leg? The reactions of the Australian fielders suggest it probably din't. Tossed-up offbreak and dips on leg stump, this is a full-blooded flick from Malan. Bancroft, it seemed like, was make taking evasive action rather than going for the ball;
52.5;?;Lyon to Malan, no run sliding onto leg stump, forward and blocked back;

46.5;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run back of a length and too straight, tucked towards midwicket off the back foot;

44.4;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run tossed up, breaks in, inside-edged back down the pitch;
44.3;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run Lyon flies to his left but the ball evades his reach. Pushed through, angling across off, some overspin, scoops a drive past the diving bowler. Lyon can't quite replicate his Adelaide heroics yet;

43.4;1;Starc to Bairstow, 1 run A direct hit could have had Malan at the striker's end. Warner swoops down on the ball at short cover but fails to throw the stumps down. Back of a length on off, tip and run. Risky... and England get away;
43.3;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run really full and sprayed down the leg side, there's a deflection - but it's off the thigh pad to Paine. Steven Smith is very animated but there's no bat involved here;

40.6;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run another zippy bouncer outside off, YJB arches his back and lets it go;
40.5;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run Cummins responds with an angry, nasty bouncer, YJB deals with it well. Sways his upper body out of the way;
40.4;4;Cummins to Bairstow, FOUR runs Oooh, that's regal! This wasn't a half-volley - fuller than a good length and outside off - he takes it on the up and drives it through the line past mid-off;
40.3;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run short but not enough width to free the arms, YJB chops it down towards backward point;
40.2;1;Cummins to Malan, 1 run these short stuff will keep both short leg and leg gully interested. Chest-high lifter on middle, Malan jumps off the ground and fends it wide of the man under the helmet;
40.1;?;Cummins to Malan, no run Cummins runs in hard, hits the deck harder, and gets it to soar over the attempted hook to slam the gloves of the keeper;
39.6;1;Starc to Malan, 1 run short ball, swatted away down to fine leg for one;
39.5;?;Starc to Malan, no run fullish, 143kph and Malan gets across his stumps to pat it away;

39.3;2;Starc to Malan, 2 runs hammering the middle of the pitch, Malan takes it on, shout of "catch!" as he clubs a pull towards deep midwicket, it was on him quickly but he managed to get the ball up and over into a gap for a couple;
39.2;?;Starc to Malan, no run around off stump, touch short of a good length and blocked;
39.1;4;Starc to Malan, FOUR runs pitched up by Starc and Malan doesn't miss out, creaming a drive through the covers;

38.3;?;Cummins to Malan, no run length on off and defended from the crease;
38.2;4;Cummins to Malan, FOUR runs banged in and Malan pulls unconvincingly, the ball squirming away wide of the diving Paine... actually came off the helmet, I think, though given as runs;

37.6;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run back of a length, leans back and lets it fly through at chest height;
37.5;W;Starc to Stoneman, OUT ripping bouncer, Stoneman throws up the hands and is beaten... or is he? No, there was a flick of glove on it! Paine took a leaping catch and Australia quickly reviewed Erasmus' not-out decision, with Aleem Dar determining that a ripple on Snicko was evidence of contact. Erasmus has to reverse the call and up goes the finger, Stoneman's gutsy knock is over! That was a snorter, unlucky for the batsmen on several levels;Mark Stoneman c ?Paine b Starc 56 (178m 110b 10x4 0x6) SR: 50.9;
37.4;?;Starc to Stoneman, no run angled in with the arm, 146kph and tucked to the leg side from back in the crease;

36.1;?;Cummins to Stoneman, no run back of a length outside off and defended towards point;
35.6;4;Starc to Malan, FOUR runs four more, slashed over the slips! Malan flashes hard and gets the reward, there was just a wide slip in but it was well beyond his reach;
35.5;4;Starc to Malan, FOUR runs on the pads, 144kph but Malan uses the pace and skims it away to fine leg for a gimme four;

34.4;?;Cummins to Malan, no run short and down the leg side, Cummins likes it, Australia go up for another catch off the glove... but Erasmus shakes his head, looks like it flicked the trouser pocket;

34.2;?;Cummins to Malan, no run length, heading on to the legs but it falls down short off the padding;
34.1;?;Cummins to Malan, no run fiery short delivery from Cummins, coming back at him from round the wicket, again he sways away;
33.6;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run another rapid bumper to finish, this time he manages to get his head and body out of the firing line;
33.5;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run flying through again as Stoneman props forward! Nipped away a fraction at 143kph as he pushes and is beaten;
33.4;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run short ball, well directed and he takes his eye off it, eventually takes it on the glove and the ball drops safely to his feet. Testing stuff, this;
33.3;4;Hazlewood to Stoneman, FOUR runs well played, not much foot movement but he opens the face and adroitly guides the ball past backward point - picks up four, and goes on to his highest Test score;
33.2;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run dug in, 138kph and this time he ducks successfully;
33.1;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run yip, beats the bat again! Good length and rising sharply as it holds its line, Stoneman not quite committing;
32.6;?;Cummins to Malan, no run yeesh, that's practically turned Malan into a pretzel! Short and rearing at the throat as he jerks the head out of the way, almost bending over backwards to evade it;
32.5;?;Cummins to Malan, no run round the wicket, hits a length and Malan defends;
32.4;W;Cummins to Root, OUT gottim, tickled down the leg side! Root fails to calm the roiling waters as Cummins gets him again, 146kph and it just flicks the gloves on its way through as he looked to turn off his hip! What a way to go, a huge breakthrough for Australia;Joe Root c ?Paine b Cummins 20 (36m 23b 4x4 0x6) SR: 86.95;
32.3;?;Cummins to Root, no run good length, around off stump and defended;
32.2;?;Cummins to Root, no run comes across and taps into the off side, defusing some of the tension;
32.1;?;Cummins to Root, no run touch back of a length around off, Root defends calmly;
31.6;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run aiming for the top of off, 146kph as Hazlewood feels the WACA juju crackle through him, stoutly blocked to see out a snorting over;

31.4;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run dug in, a genuine bouncer, flying through as Stoneman weaves out of the way;
31.3;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run length outside off, 144kph and defened. Steady;
31.2;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run banged in, helluva ball for Stoneman to face straight after that blow to the head, he fends into the air... but now Lyon drops it leaping forwards from point! Really tough chance coming in as the ball died but he got the hands there, couldn't hold on!;
31.1;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run short ball, at the batsman - takes the blow on the side of the helmet! Yowch, that's going to leave a ringing in the ears, though Stoneman is able to walk away and take off his lid unaided. The stem-guards popped off, as they often do, but the protective gear absorbed most of the impact, I think;
30.6;?;Cummins to Root, no run on the pads and clipped towards miwidwicket, quickly tidied up in the field;
30.5;?;Cummins to Root, no run ooh, feisty bumper from Cummins, has him in a moment's difficulty, Root takes the blow on the gloves but is alert and looking for the single before square leg runs in to prevent one;
30.4;?;Cummins to Root, no run plants the front foot and defends, 144kph on a good length outside off;
30.3;?;Cummins to Root, no run back of a length over the stumps, dabbed down to the off side;

29.3;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run another bumper, over middle and off as Stoneman leans back and lets it through once more;

28.2;2;Cummins to Root, 2 runs touch short, 139kph outside off and Root is well in control of a back-foot dab through the covers for a couple;

27.6;4;Hazlewood to Stoneman, FOUR runs banged in and flashed high over backward point, he's connected with this one, a lusty spank for four - and that's Stoneman's fifty, his second of the series. Can he go on?;
27.5;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run short and wide, Stoneman flings the furniture at a cut but sees the ball trampoline over his top edge and into the keeper's gloves;
27.4;?;Hazlewood to Stoneman, no run round the wicket, 144kph and banged on a hard length, clips the inside edge and rolls away;
27.3;1;Hazlewood to Root, 1 run fired in straighter, aiming for Root's pads, they've got him out a couple of times like that... but this is slapped away wide of fine leg, just the one as Stoneman is sent back thinking of a second;
27.2;?;Hazlewood to Root, no run good length, 138kph and close to off stump, lets the ball pass through;
27.1;4;Hazlewood to Root, FOUR runs pitched up first ball and Root picks up a boundary with a sliced drive through backward point. Hazlewood won't mind that too much;

26.5;?;Lyon to Stoneman, no run lobbed up on off, played back to Lyon;
26.4;1;Lyon to Root, 1 run tossed up and turns in on middle, nudged with the break to square leg;

26.1;?;Lyon to Stoneman, no run dangled up just outside off, defended off the front foot;

25.4;?;Hazlewood to Root, no run full and zipping through outside off, 147ks, left alone;
25.3;W;Hazlewood to Vince, OUT There's the (fatal) cover drive from Vince and he nicks it off with six minutes to go for lunch. Good length and hung up outside off, Vince can't restrain himself from having a crack at it. He wafts away from the body and feathers it behind to Paine. Vince loses his patience, Hazlewood reaps reward for keeping his patience;James Vince c ?Paine b Hazlewood 25 (92m 63b 4x4 0x6) SR: 39.68;

 Innings Start
Paul Dawson: "Dunno if you publish comments on comments, but Elvin's reference to Cardiff has lifted my spirits. "
Shahidul Arman: "As a England I'm looking for those guy who will say it's raining just 2/3 km away from the stadium."
1:27pm So Australia have batted 21 balls after lunch to declare. Neither the 300 lead, nor a half-century for a batsman has been achieved. The plan was to bat till No. 10 then. Paine's unbeaten on 49, Anderson's stopped one short of a five-for. And Broad has just finished with his worst figures in Tests, 0 for 142 in 35 overs. England will have to erase a deficit of 259.
179.3;W;Anderson to Lyon, OUT he's holed out and they've declared. Anderson goes full just outside off, Lyon clears the front leg and heaves for midwicket. Not quite the connection he hoped for. It's gone high and it's wobbly, but Moeen Ali is smart as he gets under it at mid-on;Nathan Lyon c Ali b Anderson 4 (8m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33;
179.2;4;Anderson to Lyon, FOUR runs shot Garry. A straight-drive-slog-tennis-forehand hybrid, straight over the bowler's head, to a length ball in the corridor;
179.1;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run back of a length and down leg side, no bat on the attempted glance;
178.6;?;Broad to Paine, no run short and wide and moving away after pitching. Paines heaves at this and might have got eight if he'd connected;
178.5;?;Broad to Paine, no run back of a length in the channel, defended on the back foot;
178.4;4;Broad to Paine, FOUR runs oh stunning shot. Springs down the track as Broad jumps into his delivery stride, and is right on top of this length ball at leg stump. Makes himself some extra pace and slaps it on the up, to the wide long-on fence;
178.3;?;Broad to Paine, no run back of a length at off stump, squeezed into the off side off the inside edge;
178.2;?;Broad to Paine, no run back of a length down leg side, looks to swivel and pull. Beaten;
178.1;?;Broad to Paine, no run length and into the pads as he looks to tickle this fine;
177.6;W;Anderson to Cummins, OUT we have another review for lbw. Another one that looks plumb too. It's an inswinger at middle stump, headed for leg. He looks to flick and can't get bat on it. It's given out. This is full and he hasn't moved too far forward. There is nothing to suggest and edge and ball tracking confirms this is hitting leg stump;Pat Cummins lbw b Anderson 41 (101m 63b 4x4 1x6) SR: 65.07;
177.5;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run good length at off stump, defended on the front foot;
177.4;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run full and into the pads, thuds him on the knee roll as he looks to flick;
177.3;2b;Anderson to Cummins, 2 byes back of a length, swinging down leg side and too much for both the batsman or Bairstow. The keeper does get a little something on it low to his left;
177.2;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run back of a length, in at middle stump. Defended on the back foot;
177.1;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run hoops in to the batsman but this is too short to trouble him. Squeezed into the off side off the back foot;
176.6;4;Broad to Paine, FOUR runs swivels to adjust nicely and place this hook exactly where he wants. It's short and steep, angling down leg side. He's under it, but the wrists are rapid as he drags it fine;
176.5;?;Broad to Paine, no run good length at off stump, big stride forward to defend to mid-off;
176.4;?;Broad to Paine, no run back of a length and down leg side, can't get anything on the flick;
176.3;1;Broad to Cummins, 1 run short ball angling in at middle, he arches backwards to guide this to third man;
176.2;4;Broad to Cummins, FOUR runs carved. Cummins, on a leg stump guard, moves his feet further down leg side against this wide length ball outside off. Slashes at it and gets it through cover point;
176.1;?;Broad to Cummins, no run back of a length outside off, pushed to cover on the up;
175.6;1;Ali to Cummins, 1 run touch short, cracked to fine leg with another meaty swing but they only get one - and that will be lunch;
175.5;?;Ali to Cummins, no run darted leg side as Cummins goes to sweep again, misses out;
175.4;6;Ali to Cummins, SIX runs there she blows, rolls out the slog-sweep, into the stands for six! Connected clean as a whistle and the Doctor helped do the rest;

173.3;?;Ali to Paine, no run floated up leg side and deflected away;
173.2;3;Ali to Cummins, 3 runs flighted, slightly leg side and Cummins sweeps powerfully past short fine leg, Overton is still putting in the effort and he barrels around from deep square-ish to slide and prevent four - wholehearted stuff;
173.1;?;Ali to Cummins, no run round the wicket, tossed up and tapped away;
172.6;4;Broad to Paine, FOUR runs in the channel, not a bad ball but it is struck superbly well by Paine, high elbow and placement behind the man in the deep, timing to swoon over and it screams into the ropes;
172.5;?;Broad to Paine, no run fullish and straight, plinked to mid-on half forward;
172.4;1lb;Broad to Cummins, 1 leg bye yowch, that's rearing off a short length and it takes Cummins on the elbow - maybe arm guard - and loops behind square;
172.3;?;Broad to Cummins, no run length, 133kph and climbing outside off, Cummins defends into the turf;
172.2;?;Broad to Cummins, no run goes straighter, touched into the leg side;
172.1;1;Broad to Paine, 1 run length, poked short of the man at mid-off and they scamper through;

171.4;?;Overton to Cummins, no run in the channel, big swing and a miss;
171.3;2;Overton to Cummins, 2 runs short ball, decent bumper from Overton, Cummins loses control of a hook but the top edge clears square leg and they get a couple;
171.2;1;Overton to Paine, 1 run sliding and worked off the pads;
171.1;1;Overton to Cummins, 1 run trundles in and hits a length outside off, Cummins guides one more to third man - 50 stand up between these two, checking England's early advance;
170.6;?;Broad to Paine, no run fullish, shaping away as Paine gets into line and leaves once more;
170.5;?;Broad to Paine, no run testing line in the channel, judges it well and leave alone;
170.4;?;Broad to Paine, no run full around off, Paine blocks this one into the covers;
170.3;?;Broad to Paine, no run there it goes again, hits a ditch and springs away from Paine, past the forward poke;

170.1;1lb;Broad to Paine, 1 leg bye length, on the stumps and it jumps nastily at Paine, who fends it away behind square off the glove;
169.6;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run angled in with the arm, 135kph and defended back down the track;
169.5;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run draws the drive, a big booming swing from Cummins, hand off the bat as it beats him and flies through to YJB;
169.4;4;Woakes to Cummins, FOUR runs shot! Just a glide off the back foot but he middles it and the ball races away past backward point - and the lead goes over 200, too;
169.3;2;Woakes to Cummins, 2 runs sliding into the pads, he flicks through backward square and they run well for two;
169.2;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run length on off, Paine dabs one into the covers;
169.1;3;Woakes to Cummins, 3 runs shot outsiede off and Cummins swats it powerfully through backward point, won't quite go all the way - but it brings up the Australia 600. You don't see too many of those;
168.6;?;Broad to Paine, no run whoosh, past the bat again, just a soupcon of nip off the surface this time as Paine closes the face;
168.5;?;Broad to Paine, no run angled in and tapped back towards mid-on;
168.4;4;Broad to Paine, FOUR runs pitched up, finds the outside edge... but it flies through vacant first slip for four! Another despairing dive from Bairstow, genuine thick edge but Cook is stood wide and neither was getting close to it;
168.3;4lb;Broad to Paine, 4 leg byes leg side, this goes straight on and flies for byes... or did it touch the pad? No chance to the keeper, either way;
168.2;?;Broad to Paine, no run criminy, that's gone like legbreak! Hits the surface and pongos away from Paine as he plays tentatively forward -miles away from hitting it but no batsman wants to see that;
168.1;?;Broad to Paine, no run probing, maybe nibbling away in the channel, left alone;
167.6;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run fired in and tapped back to the on side - that's a maiden;

165.1;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run dug in and Paine whirls on a pull, controlled it well for one to fine leg;
164.6;4;Anderson to Cummins, FOUR runs outside edge to an inswinger that keeps low. Nothing about that ball was friendly to the batsman. Could have had him out three ways as he pushed forward, but its four through the slip cordon;

163.6;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run good length at middle stump, defended to mid-on;

163.3;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run takes his eyes off this as it climbs up on him in the corridor. Awkwardly bunts it pitchside;

162.2;?;Anderson to Paine, no run looks very plumb as Paine cops this in front of middle stump, just above the knee roll. It's been given. He's reviewed it. He has been batting well outside the crease. If anything saves him it'll be that. There's no edge...and it's missing! Big stride, helped by where he started this shot, helps him make that review straight away. This is swinging in and climbing over leg stump. Good review;

159.3;?;Woakes to Paine, no run full at leg stump, flicked straight to short midwicket. No movement on that one;
159.2;?;Woakes to Paine, no run good length at off stump, defended solidly on the back foot;
159.1;?;Woakes to Paine, no run full outside off, bit of wobble as Paine jabs at this well in front of his body. Drives to mid-off;

158.3;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run length at off stump, drops it into the covers with soft hands;

157.6;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run bouncer at middle stump, gets well under that as he ducks;
157.5;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run full at off stump, defended on the front foot;
157.4;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run length ball in the corridor. Defends from the crease, inside the line. Outside edge fizzes to first slip on the bounce;
157.3;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run it's moving now. Full outswinger just outside off. Hardly any feet as he pokes this to mid-off;
157.2;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run beaten on the outside edge. Angled in at the corridor, draws the bat out and then zips past it;
157.1;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run nearly another run out. At the non-striker's this time. Paine drops this length ball in the gully region and takes off. The fielder can't hit the stumps;
156.6;W;Anderson to Paine, OUT oh dear Starc has messed this one up. Paine's blinded - he's just taken a big inswinger on the pad as he's looked to flick. It's flown towards gully as England make the appeal. Starc's called for the run, then realised there's no chance. Paine's halfway down when he gets the call for no. A bit of an empty stare between the batsmen before Starc decides it'll be him who takes the fall. England have a mere walk to clip the stumps at the striker's end;Mitchell Starc run out (Vince) 1 (6m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
156.5;?;Anderson to Paine, no run full, swinging in at leg stump. Inside edge and onto the pad as his head falls over during the attempted flick;
156.4;1;Anderson to Starc, 1 run and it turns out that man is a catching fielder too. One that Starc almost finds. Lifts this length ball on the up, and it lands short;
156.3;?;Anderson to Starc, no run length at middle stump, bunted uppishly towards short midwicket;
156.2;?;Anderson to Starc, no run back of a length, slanted across off stump. Poked into the covers on the up;
156.1;W;Anderson to Smith, OUT another review. Smith is hit on the pad in front of middle, just like Marsh. There were a couple of sounds. Umpire's said not out...there's no bat on the replay. And ball tracking says that's hitting! Decision overturned. A good review from England. Anderson was unsure, because of the sounds I reckon. Smith was playing down the wrong line as this one straightened from a middle stump line. He was right back in the crease as he is wont to do. England hitting the right spots this morning. Smith's highest score will read 239. An epic ends;Steven Smith lbw b Anderson 239 (578m 399b 30x4 1x6) SR: 59.89;

155.1;?;Woakes to Smith, no run length at off stump, defended on the back foot;
154.6;?;Anderson to Paine, no run hello! Whew! Looks like that one's lifted off a crack. Completely beats Paine who is set up solidly on the front foot with the full face of the bat pointing down the pitch, only to see it zip away from him like a legbreak;
154.5;?;Anderson to Paine, no run some shape for Anderson again. Tails away from off stump on a length, defended solidly on the front foot;
154.4;?;Anderson to Paine, no run full and in at leg stump, can't get bat on the attempted flick, cops it on the pad;
154.3;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run full and into the pads, clipped from the crease. Moeen Ali gets down quickly at square leg this time, to his left, and keeps it to one;
154.2;?;Anderson to Smith, no run length at middle stump, defended down the pitch;
154.1;4;Anderson to Smith, FOUR runs here we go. The first Smith flick of the day. A length ball, angled into the pads. Stands tall, whips it past square leg who is a tad slow getting down to his left. Deep midwicket fetches from the boundary;

152.4;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run nicely pushed wide of mid-off. Bit of movement away from Anderson, at a full length outside off. Paine leans into it for his first run;
152.3;?;Anderson to Paine, no run back of a length and in the channel, defended away from the body, into the pitch off the inside half;
152.2;W;Anderson to Marsh, OUT it looks like Anderson has trapped him right in front of middle stump. It's been given. It's also been reviewed. Slightly fuller length ball from the last one, nips back in a touch. Marsh sitting on the back foot and he's beaten on the inside edge. The reviews shows no edge...and tracking tells us that's clipping the top of the stumps for what will remain an umpire's call and that is an abrupt end to Marsh's innings;Mitchell Marsh lbw b Anderson 181 (322m 236b 29x4 0x6) SR: 76.69;
