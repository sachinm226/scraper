Well, run outs are normally the sign of a team off their pace. The innings was top and tailed with a pair of woeful run outs. In between Australia, marshalled superbly by Clarke, pulled off an excellent display. No England batsman got going, even Jonathan Trott who finished unbeaten on 84, unable to up the pace and intensity when needed to. Brett Lee was excellent, as was Xavier Doherty. England were not. "If anyone can make sense of that Trott innings for me, please do," invites our very own Dileep Premachandran on Twitter.
Gnasher McGlashan will have a bulletin to tell you, and maybe him, all about it. Elsewhere you can explore the fun of our YouTube channel. Join us at 18.30 for the resumption.
47.6;W;Watson to Tremlett, OUT goodness me, this is shocking. Tremlett has run himself out in dreadful fashion. Pushed into the off side for what should have been an easy single. Tremlett dawdled, barely stretched to run his bat in. In the end his bat was over the line but in the air when the bails came off.

46.4;W;Lee to Shahzad, OUT and Shahzad is gone, Lee gets his third! Shahzad was trying to go over the top and make use of the Powerplay, he's lifted it towards mid-off and White didn't have to move far to his left to make the catch;Ajmal Shahzad c White b Lee 4 (9m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;

44.3;1;Lee to Woakes, 1 run similar shot this time, although point was a bit finer and knocked it down during his dive;
44.2;2;Lee to Woakes, 2 runs well played by Woakes, he waits on this and cuts late enough to beat point, but forward enough to make fine leg do some running;

31.1;2;Watson to Wright, 2 runs Wright advances down the wicket and drives nicely deep into the off side;

30.4;?;Lee to Wright, no run this time it's fuller and Wright attempts a drive without remotely timing it;

30.2;1w;Lee to Wright, 1 wide too far outside off stump for the batsman, and the umpire;
30.1;1;Lee to Trott, 1 run Lee continues after the refuelling with a fullish ball outside off, Trott crisply drives wide of cover;

29.3;1;Doherty to Trott, 1 run hint of width allows Trott to chop a single to third man;
29.2;?;Doherty to Trott, no run solidly driven but straight to cover. Good pressure building by Doherty;
29.1;?;Doherty to Trott, no run Doherty is causing all sorts of trouble. Imagine that! Gets some spin here and it slides off the edge to short third man;
28.6;?;Lee to Wright, no run after the aberration the ball before Wright reverts to a studious leave-alone;
28.5;?;Lee to Wright, no run this time he aims a drive at a zippy outswinger and he was late on it, bat far away from body and never looked like connecting;
28.4;?;Lee to Wright, no run in another mood Wright would slash wildly at this but here he solemnly shoulders arms to a widish ball outside off;

27.5;?;Doherty to Wright, no run oops, Doherty starts wide outside off stump;
27.4;W;Doherty to Yardy, OUT Yardy's gone. Soft dismissal, simple dismissal. He edged down the wicket and chipped it gently back to Doherty;Michael Yardy c & b Doherty 7 (9m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 87.5;
27.3;1;Doherty to Trott, 1 run Trott has looked in no bother for a while and he picks off another single pushing down to long-off;

27.1;?;Doherty to Yardy, no run very nicely played here, Yardy skipping down the wicket and driving solidly to cover;
26.6;1;Hussey to Yardy, 1 run Yardy on the paddle again. He's looked fluent so far, the first of all the England batsmen really. Gets this down to fine leg to pinch the strike;
26.6;1w;Hussey to Yardy, 1 wide shoved down the leg side, too far for the umpire's liking;
26.5;2;Hussey to Yardy, 2 runs another full toss outside off and Yardy is down on one knee again, flipping this to fine leg;

25.2;1;Doherty to Yardy, 1 run Yardy solidly clips his first ball wide of mid-on for a single;
25.1;W;Doherty to PD Collingwood, OUT Doherty strikes! Collingwood's miserable run of form continues. This is pretty awful, he's missed a straight ball. Just played down the line of middle, feet stuck to the ground, and it hit off stump;Paul Collingwood b Doherty 1 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
24.6;?;Hussey to Trott, no run Trott is looking solid in defence;
24.5;1;Hussey to PD Collingwood, 1 run ooh, so nearly all over straight away for him. Collingwood inside-edging his first ball this far wide of leg stump;
24.4;W;Hussey to Morgan, OUT oh no! Filthy long hop is nailed to midwicket where Clarke holds a fine catch. Morgan has fallen to some awful deliveries this series. Just as he was looking good he's smashed a pull shot straight to midwicket;Eoin Morgan c Clarke b Hussey 30 (47m 41b 2x4 0x6) SR: 73.17;
24.3;2;Hussey to Morgan, 2 runs misfield this time earns Morgan a couple. It was worked to square leg where a needless fumble allowed Morgan to come back;
24.2;2;Hussey to Morgan, 2 runs nicely done again, Morgan suddenly finding the middle of the bat. Down the wicket and flicking into a gap wide between long-on and midwicket;
24.1;4;Hussey to Morgan, FOUR runs ah brilliant shot here. Morgan down the wicket and driving wide of long-off, timed this very well and it rushed to the rope;

23.5;2;Doherty to Morgan, 2 runs neatly played this time, half-volley outside off stump and whipped to straightish midwicket. That was well timed, for once;
23.4;?;Doherty to Morgan, no run Morgan cannot find bat on ball. Here he skips outside leg and aims a cut but it shoots under his bat;
23.3;1;Doherty to Trott, 1 run Trott has fifty and fittingly gets there by patting a needless single wide of point. He's played excellently after a tricky start;

23.1;1;Doherty to Trott, 1 run Trott is looking far more solid and pushes neatly wide of cover;
22.6;2;Hussey to Morgan, 2 runs Morgan's struggles continue! This is so close. Top edge from an attempted cut loops just over point;

21.5;1;Doherty to Morgan, 1 run back of length here and Morgan hops outside leg stump to cut to deep point;
21.4;?;Doherty to Morgan, no run oooh, play and miss outside off. Nicely tossed up by Doherty and Morgan flashed and missed. Haddin whipped the bails off, as much to prove he can as anything;
21.3;?;Doherty to Morgan, no run worked carefully to midwicket;
21.3;1w;Doherty to Morgan, 1 wide oops, this is thrown up far too wide outside off stump;
21.2;2;Doherty to Morgan, 2 runs ooh, Morgan is giving his edge a real working over today. This again slips off the outside edge through where slip could have been down to third man;
21.1;1;Doherty to Trott, 1 run starts well enough, rolling the ball on a decent length around middle and worked to deep fine leg;
20.6;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run Bollinger finishes a good over well, hitting back of a length around off stump. Morgan finally middles a ball but it's just a block back to the bowler;
20.5;1;Bollinger to Trott, 1 run this is well played, Trott up on his toes to a good delivery outside off stump and dropping into the covers for a swift single. Trott's in trouble though. The throw hit him on the back of the leg and it seems to have hit the back of left knee. He's writhing around in pain until the painkillers are brought out;
20.4;?;Bollinger to Trott, no run Trott gets a full ball outside off stump and tries to work it to leg. Such is his way;
20.3;1lb;Bollinger to Morgan, 1 leg bye Morgan willing himself on as Bollinger runs up. "Watch the ball," he chants. Doesn't do him much good though as he misses a leg-stump nurdle;
20.2;1;Bollinger to Trott, 1 run Trott on the pull, always a scary preposition, didn't get much of it and it looped up high off the bat heading one bounce to deep midwicket;
20.1;?;Bollinger to Trott, no run Trott is solidly and solemnly behind a defence after all that excitement;
19.6;4;Smith to Morgan, FOUR runs oooh, almost the most sensational catch at long-off, flying to his left. Morgan was down the wicket and driving not quite with perfect timing but it brings him his first boundary;
19.5;1;Smith to Trott, 1 run Trott on the sweep again, not as effective here but a single is valuable;
19.4;?;Smith to Trott, no run ooh, Trott tries to flick to leg and it loops up off the pads;
19.3;2;Smith to Trott, 2 runs this time Smith drops short and Trott is on the cut, playing it well enough to pick up a couple;
19.2;4;Smith to Trott, FOUR runs boundary! Precious boundary! We've not had many. Trott gets down on one knee and sweeps a full ball powerfully to the square leg rope;
19.1;1;Smith to Morgan, 1 run Smith tosses one up outside off stump and Morgan drives down to mid-off;
18.6;1lb;Bollinger to Morgan, 1 leg bye Bollinger gets his line wrong, slipping this onto the pads but Morgan misses his leg-side whip and it bobbles off the pads;
18.5;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run Morgan very carefully gets everything behind his backfoot defence;
18.4;1;Bollinger to Trott, 1 run Trott tries to cut a ball which is a touch close to him so ends up chopping untidily down to third man;
18.3;1;Bollinger to Morgan, 1 run thickish outside edge outside off stump this time. Morgan just needs to get through this horrible period;
18.2;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run short and wide but Morgan's swish outside off finds fresh air;
18.1;1;Bollinger to Trott, 1 run who tares in as usual and Trott shuffles across his stumps to work a single to leg. "If he misses when it's straight he'll be in trouble," yells Haddin. What a smart reader of the game he is;
17.6;?;Smith to Morgan, no run short ball, poor ball, but Morgan can't quite nail it. Instead his cut finds extra cover;
17.5;1;Smith to Trott, 1 run Trott skips up the wicket a fraction and flicks a single into the leg side;
17.4;1;Smith to Morgan, 1 run worked back wide of the bowler;

17.2;1;Smith to Morgan, 1 run tossed up again and this time Morgan beats the bowler to jog a single;
17.1;?;Smith to Morgan, no run Smith has settled and tosses this nicely up and Morgan pushes back to the bowler;
16.6;1;Watson to Morgan, 1 run to counter Watson's lack of pace Morgan is batting two feet out of his crease. It works in the sense that his cover drive is very well timed to deep cover;
16.5;?;Watson to Morgan, no run Watson adjusts his line to suitably fit the left hander and Morgan pops forward to defend with low hands;
16.4;1;Watson to Trott, 1 run another slowish bouncer and Trott this time works it around the corner;
16.3;?;Watson to Trott, no run short ball, slower ball bouncer that Trott pops under. He could have stood up and worked a single but no;
16.2;?;Watson to Trott, no run Watson not trying to do anything special just holding a good line and Trott seems unable to do much about it;
16.1;?;Watson to Trott, no run Watson hitting a good length and line and Trott gets half forward to defend around his front pad;
15.6;?;Smith to Morgan, no run nothing on offer here for Morgan, carefully patted back to the bowler;
15.5;1;Smith to Trott, 1 run neatly pushed to long-on but good length from Smith;

15.3;?;Smith to Trott, no run Smith finds a good line and length this time and it's carefully defended;
15.2;1;Smith to Morgan, 1 run another full toss and it allows Morgan to get off the mark, patting down to long-off;
15.1;1;Smith to Trott, 1 run wow, what a start! Huge, filthy full-toss, should have ended up in the stands but Trott has barely middled a ball all innings so wheels this to deep midwicket;
14.6;?;Watson to Morgan, no run more secure on this, Morgan talking a fuller stride forward into this drive to mid-off;
14.5;?;Watson to Morgan, no run Watson operating on a very tight offstump line and Morgan is half forward to defend;
14.4;?;Watson to Morgan, no run a rare feeling of bat on ball, not quite out the middle but enough to trickle to cover. Morgan still pinned on 0;
14.3;?;Watson to Morgan, no run having played and missed the last time, Morgan opts to leave all alone this time round;
14.2;?;Watson to Morgan, no run Morgan has a flirt outside off stump. He looks out of nick, nothing more or less complicated that that;
14.1;1;Watson to Trott, 1 run Trott shuffles across his stumps and flicks a full ball to deep midwicket for a jogged single;
13.6;?;Hastings to Morgan, no run cut away to point and can't find the gap;
13.5;?;Hastings to Morgan, no run fuller and straighter from Hastings, and Morgan works it to leg;
13.4;?;Hastings to Morgan, no run driven to mid-off;
13.3;?;Hastings to Morgan, no run another appeal! For caught at slip this time - the Australians think there was an edge on to the pad, and Watson took the catch cleanly. Reiffel says no, and Clarke wants a review. But that was a great decision, there were two noises but it was the front flap of the pad and then the back thigh, no bat involved. Morgan survives!;
13.2;?;Hastings to Morgan, no run Hastings asks the question for lbw here, but Paul Reiffel says no, and to the naked eye that looked to have pitched well outside leg from Hastings' angle from over the wicket;
13.1;1;Hastings to Trott, 1 run worked through midwicket again for another single;
12.6;W;Watson to Bell, OUT gone! Good return catch from Watson! Bell tried to work it from outside off through the leg side, a-la Trott, but got a leading edge and Watson hurled himself to his left to take a very sharp catch;Ian Bell c & b Watson 10 (21m 16b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.5;
12.5;?;Watson to Bell, no run good accuracy from Watson, and Bell pushes to off;
12.4;?;Watson to Bell, no run Bell tries a big drive outside off and misses - Haddin makes the take as the ball cannons into his palms;
12.3;1;Watson to Trott, 1 run fullish and just outside off, Trott opens the face and gets another run to third man, who has been busy in the last few overs;
12.2;1;Watson to Bell, 1 run angling in to the pads, and it's clipped through square leg;
12.1;1;Watson to Trott, 1 run flicked through square leg;
11.6;1;Hastings to Trott, 1 run oh, another slower one and Hastings almost creates a chance as Trott drives it back past the bowler, in the air but out of reach, and gets a single;
11.5;1;Hastings to Bell, 1 run quicker and bouncier now, and Bell steers it to third man;
11.4;?;Hastings to Bell, no run ah, good slower ball from Hastings and he goes really wide of off, drawing Bell into a swipe and he almost falls out of his crease as Haddin whips the bails off, but Bell is safe;
11.3;?;Hastings to Bell, no run defended right down at his feet;
11.2;?;Hastings to Bell, no run wide of off now and Bell cuts to point;
11.1;1;Hastings to Trott, 1 run Trott now flicks it from outside off behind square leg and that's very good fielding by Smith on the boundary to keep that to a single;
10.6;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run tries to go for a late cut this time but doesn't connect;
10.5;2;Bollinger to Bell, 2 runs Bell walks across almost Trott-like now, and clips one uppishly from leg stump over square leg, picks up a couple of runs;
10.4;1;Bollinger to Trott, 1 run clipped through square leg;
10.3;?;Bollinger to Trott, no run Trott dances down the pitch now and tries to slam Bollinger through cover, but he can't make contact with the ball;
10.2;1;Bollinger to Bell, 1 run another guide to third man, Bell opens the face and runs the ball along the ground;
10.1;4;Bollinger to Bell, FOUR runs good shot from Bell, he uses his feet and then forces it through cover and it races away to the boundary;
9.6;1;Hastings to Bell, 1 run and Bell gets off the mark with a similar guide to third man, just opening the face;
9.5;1;Hastings to Trott, 1 run guided very deliberately this time to third man;
9.4;4;Hastings to Trott, FOUR runs Hastings forces Trott wide of off and he has a swing, getting a thick edge that flies safely away through the vacant slip region for a boundary;
9.3;?;Hastings to Trott, no run clipped to short midwicket;
9.2;?;Hastings to Trott, no run pushed wide of mid-off and can't find a run as Lee does the fielding;
9.1;?;Hastings to Trott, no run Trott tries to swivel a pull but gets an edge on to his body, Haddin is still up to the stumps for Hastings;
8.6;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run guided to point and can't find a run;
8.5;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run ah, big swing from Bell, who tries an expansive cover drive and doesn't get any bat on a ball angled across him;
8.4;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run Bell pushes his first ball to cover;
8.3;1;Bollinger to Trott, 1 run driven to cover and Trott gets a single;
8.2;2;Bollinger to Trott, 2 runs fullish and straight, it's clipped through square leg;
8.1;?;Bollinger to Trott, no run a full toss to start with, and it's edged into the ground and through to Haddin;
7.6;W;Hastings to Trott, OUT oh no! A comedy of errors from both teams, and the end result is a run-out, but who has to go? Trott pushed to midwicket, where there was a misfield by Hussey, who knocks it down to mid-on, where Doherty underarmed to the bowler's end and missed the stumps - but by this stage Strauss had turned back halfway through the single, and both batsmen were racing to the bowler's end. So the miss was backed up by Clarke, who threw to Haddin, who took the bails off with both batsmen at the other end of the pitch. Trott has beaten Strauss home, so Strauss has to go!;Andrew Strauss run out (Hussey/Doherty/Clarke/?Haddin) 23 (39m 27b 2x4 0x6) SR: 85.18;
7.5;1;Hastings to Strauss, 1 run clipped off middle by Strauss, who gets a single behind square leg;

7.3;1;Hastings to Strauss, 1 run a bit too short from Hastings and Strauss pulls to deep midwicket;
7.2;1;Hastings to Trott, 1 run Trott walks across outside off and guides a wide-ish one to third man;
7.2;1w;Hastings to Trott, 1 wide bouncer, but it's too high and it's called a wide;
7.1;?;Hastings to Trott, no run Trott decides he too will go after Hastings, advancing down the pitch, but he misses his attempted cut;
6.6;2;Lee to Strauss, 2 runs a slower bouncer this time and Strauss swivels a pull behind square leg, it looks like making the rope but Smith makes a diving save;
6.5;?;Lee to Strauss, no run Strauss drives a bump ball back over the head of Lee;
6.4;1;Lee to Trott, 1 run Lee gives Trott a bit of width now and a solid cover drive could easily have raced through to the boundary, but Clarke makes a very good diving save to his left;
6.3;1;Lee to Strauss, 1 run Strauss goes for the pull yet again, and once more it's collected at deep square leg, he's struggling to find the boundary from that shot;
6.2;1;Lee to Trott, 1 run Trott takes one from outside off and whips it through midwicket;
6.1;?;Lee to Trott, no run ah, that's a ripper, quick and bouncing more than Trott expected, he looks to dab a cut away and it whizzes over his top edge;
5.6;1;Hastings to Trott, 1 run a bit too straight for Trott, who enjoys clipping one off his hips through square leg;
5.5;1;Hastings to Strauss, 1 run clipped through midwicket for another run;
5.4;?;Hastings to Strauss, no run straighter line now and Strauss nudges to mid off;
5.3;4;Hastings to Strauss, FOUR runs Strauss is going after Hastings! He's gone over wide mid-off now, and this is a much safer shot, finding the gap and the boundary;
5.2;4;Hastings to Strauss, FOUR runs Strauss throws the kitchen sink at this one and almost gets caught! He's slashed hard at a cut and Smith at point hurled himself to his left, just couldn't get a fingertip to it;
5.1;?;Hastings to Strauss, no run he pushes it across Strauss, who cuts straight to point;
4.6;?;Lee to Trott, no run pushed back past the bowler but straight to mid-off;
4.5;?;Lee to Trott, no run driven away to cover but Trott can't find the gap;
4.4;1;Lee to Strauss, 1 run Strauss tries to force one through cover and doesn't time it, but gets a quick single all the same;
4.3;?;Lee to Strauss, no run good fielding at point, Strauss went for the big drive and it was saved by a diving Marsh;
4.2;1;Lee to Trott, 1 run edged away through a vacant fourth slip area, and it's collected at third man;
4.1;?;Lee to Trott, no run Lee bowls the slower ball and for some reason, despite it being a free hit, Trott doesn't have a swing! Very odd;
4.1;5nb;Lee to Trott, (no ball) FOUR runs there's the first boundary of the day, and what a good cover-drive it is, picking the gap and timing it to perfection. And to add to Lee's frustration, it was a no-ball;
3.6;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run driven down to mid-on and again Hastings does the fielding;
3.5;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run nips back in a touch off the seam, Strauss punches to cover;

3.1;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run full and straight from Bollinger, Strauss clips to midwicket;

2.5;?;Lee to Strauss, no run again Brett Lee gives Strauss no width, and the batsman defends;
2.4;?;Lee to Strauss, no run just outside off again, Strauss pushes to cover;
2.3;1;Lee to Trott, 1 run pulled through square leg;
2.2;?;Lee to Trott, no run there's an lbw shout from Lee, at first he was hesitant but then really convinced himself. Gary Baxter says not out, and Trott was on the walk and hit above the roll, so you'd have to think that was too high;
2.1;?;Lee to Trott, no run Lee hits the right line just outside off again, and Trott defends;
1.6;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run solidly defended as Bollinger probes outside off, he hasn't found any swing in this over;
1.5;2;Bollinger to Strauss, 2 runs on the pads, not a great delivery from Bollinger, and Strauss whips it behind square leg;
1.4;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run defended back to Bollinger;
1.3;2;Bollinger to Strauss, 2 runs banged in short of a length and Strauss is on to the pull, there's a man in the deep but he can't prevent a second run, although a quicker throw might have had Strauss in trouble;
1.2;1;Bollinger to Trott, 1 run Trott walks across and works a single to square leg to get off the mark;
1.1;1;Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run oh, an edge immediately but Strauss gets away with it, as the ball flies wide of second slip. That was a genuine edge, not a deliberate glide;
0.6;?;Lee to Trott, no run Trott gets behind his first ball and defends back down the pitch;
0.5;W;Lee to Prior, OUT Prior is gone in the first over! Ah, the Prior opening experiment is really not working for England. Lee has angled one back in and Prior is struck on the pad, low down, and given out. He asks for a review but that is plumb. He's gone!;Matt Prior lbw b Lee 0 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
0.4;?;Lee to Prior, no run straighter this time and Prior leaves it;
0.3;?;Lee to Prior, no run ah, really good swing away from Prior, who pushes the bat outside off and fortunately for him, doesn't get an edge;
0.2;1;Lee to Strauss, 1 run Strauss gets England off the mark with a single to deep square leg as Lee swings one on to the pads;
0.1;?;Lee to Strauss, no run good line immediately, just outside off and straightening a fraction, Strauss leaves it;

2.20pm The players are out in the middle, and England are ready to try to fight back in to this series. Prior and Strauss are opening up, and it will be Brett Lee to bowl the first over.
I'm Brydon Coverdale and I'll be joined later by Sahil Dutta.
1.50pm Andrew Strauss has won the toss and England will bat.
Luke Wright has been named in England's side, he will replace James Tredwell. And Paul Collingwood comes back in for Pietersen, while Chris Woakes makes his ODI debut as a replacement for Tim Bresnan.
England 1 Andrew Strauss (capt), 2 Matt Prior (wk), 3 Jonathan Trott, 4 Ian Bell, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Paul Collingwood, 7 Luke Wright, 8 Michael Yardy, 9 Chris Woakes, 10 Ajmal Shahzad, 11 Chris Tremlett
Michael Clarke says: "I'm happy England are playing just the one spinner, that's for sure."
And Shaun Marsh, the matchwinner for Australia on Friday, has been promoted to No. 3. The Australians are clearly keen to retain Watson and Haddin as the opening pair for the World Cup, but Marsh does get some reward and Clarke will drop down the order.
John Hastings is in the side to replace the injured Tait, and as expected, Xavier Doherty comes in for Hauritz.
Australia 1 Shane Watson, 2 Brad Haddin (wk), 3 Shaun Marsh, 4 Michael Clarke (capt), 5 Cameron White, 6 David Hussey, 7 Steven Smith, 8 John Hastings, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Xavier Doherty, 11 Doug Bollinger
1.40pm Hello again, welcome to the third ODI between Australia and England at the SCG, where I'm pleased to tell you the weather is perfect.
But in not so good news for England, Kevin Pietersen has a groin strain and will not play, and Tim Bresnan is also out with a calf injury. The teams are not yet official, but it seems likely Paul Collingwood might come in, and Chris Woakes could get an opportunity.
For Australia, Shaun Tait hurt his thigh during Friday's win, and he won't play. Nor, of course, will Nathan Hauritz, after that gut-churning shoulder dislocation he suffered in the field. Hauritz will have arthroscopic surgery in a bid to make him available for the World Cup, though I'm sure Xavier Doherty senses a door has been pushed ajar for him.
 Innings Start
Australia win by four wickets Australia go 3-0 up, their fourth win in a row. After a wobble chasing England's modest total David Hussey with Steve Smith firstly and then John Hastings have steered them to a comfortable victory. Australia's bowlers, led by Brett Lee and backed up by Xavier Doherty, set up the victory. England didn't do much right today and now need to win an unlikely four games in a row if they are to avoid their first loss in an ODI series since losing to Australia 6-1 after the 2009 Ashes. Andrew McGlashan will tell you all about it in his bulletin which will be ready shortly. We also have a gallery packed with today's best photos. That's all from us, please join us on Wednesday for the fourth game. In the meantime entertain yourselves with our Facebook page

40.6;?;Yardy to Hussey, no run driven out to extra cover to end the over;
40.5;6;Yardy to Hussey, SIX runs full toss and it's enough to get Hussey to fifty! He's mullered it, rightly so, slapped into the stands at deep midwicket. "That ball had six written all over it," says the Shastri perched in my head;

30.4;?;Yardy to Smith, no run pushed back to the bowler;

29.5;?;Woakes to Hussey, no run bouncer, and Hussey ducks it;

29.2;1;Woakes to Hussey, 1 run pushed away to point and finds a quick single;

27.5;2;Shahzad to Smith, 2 runs fuller this time and Smith drives to mid-on, and there's a direct hit at the non-striker's end with Smith safely in his ground, and the deflection allows an overthrow;
27.4;4;Shahzad to Smith, FOUR runs very good shot! That's a forceful square drive, hit on the up but safely behind point, and with enough timing that third man has no hope of getting across to prevent that reaching the boundary;

24.5;?;PD Collingwood to Smith, no run and he's back into solid defence, bat and pad close together;
24.4;6;PD Collingwood to Smith, SIX runs yes, it was only a matter of time before Smith decided to go after a ball, and he's got enough on it over square leg! He's just slogged that, lifting it high and just over the rope;

18.2;W;PD Collingwood to White, OUT White is gone! Collingwood strikes! Angling the ball in, he strikes White on the pad and Reiffel gives him out. White wants a review - there were two noises and height looked like it would be an issue, but the replays show that hit both pads, and was clipping the top of leg stump, so the decision stands;Cameron White lbw b Collingwood 7 (31m 23b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.43;

16.4;3;Woakes to White, 3 runs White is sick of being bogged down, and he launches everything at a big drive over the off side, getting it much higher than he intended but it lands safely in the outfield, not timed as he would have liked;

16.2;1;Woakes to Haddin, 1 run a single this time as Haddin late cuts and gets un under-edge into the turf, just wide of Prior;
16.1;?;Woakes to Haddin, no run Haddin defends solidly now, he's pinned inside the crease with Prior up to the stumps;
15.6;1;Wright to Haddin, 1 run another one angles down leg, and this time Haddin glances behind square;
15.5;4;Wright to Haddin, FOUR runs and this time Haddin finds the gap behind square with his pull around the corner, Wright has been much too straight this over, trying to overcorrect and not allow Haddin to go over the off side;

13.5;?;Wright to White, no run White defends uneasily from the crease;
13.4;1;Wright to Haddin, 1 run oh no dropped by Tremlett! Should have got it. Haddin looking to repeat his drive but mistimed it and it was dying on Tremlett as it arrived on him, couldn't get down properly and spilled the chance;
13.3;4;Wright to Haddin, FOUR runs lovely shot, Haddin was itching for this. Gets leg side of the ball again and threw his arms through the line, pinged through the offside for four. Such sweet timing;
13.2;?;Wright to Haddin, no run good line and length here forces Haddin to block;
13.1;?;Wright to Haddin, no run ooh, all sorts happening! Fullish ball which Haddin drives uppishly, one-bounce to mid-on, Strauss threw to the non-striker's end and White had hared up the crease before diving back full length;

12.5;?;Woakes to White, no run excellent length and line from Woakes, heading for the top of off and forcing White to defend;
12.4;?;Woakes to White, no run touch fuller but White is hanging back which makes his pushed defence look strange;

12.1;1;Woakes to Haddin, 1 run this is worked into space for an easy single;
11.6;?;Tremlett to White, no run banged in short of a length but it doesn't really rear up and White has plenty of time to knock it into the off side;
11.5;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run this is straighter and pushed wide of mid-on for a jogged single;
11.4;1;Tremlett to White, 1 run not really a short ball, back of a length perhaps outside off stump and White steered it to third man;

11.2;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run slower ball this time and left all alone;
11.1;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run hint of extra bounce and away movement is wisely flagged through by Haddin;
11.1;1w;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 wide Tremlett continues, probably for White, but this is shoved down the leg side;
10.6;W;Woakes to Clarke, OUT this time Clarke has gone and Woakes has his first ODI wicket! Poor Clarke just can't revive his fortunes. Full ball on his pads and he's whipped it straight to Yardy at short midwicket who needed three attempts to juggle and catch it;Michael Clarke c Yardy b Woakes 9 (31m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
10.5;2;Woakes to Clarke, 2 runs slid down the leg side and Clarke gets a leading edge that loops wide of mid-on;
10.4;1;Woakes to Haddin, 1 run Haddin makes room ominously again but this time prods a single to point;

10.2;1;Woakes to Clarke, 1 run bit gentle here, fullish on leg stump and Clarke flicks it to deep midwicket;
10.1;?;Woakes to Clarke, no run starts with a full ball that is drilled back at him;
9.6;1;Tremlett to Clarke, 1 run worked off the pads wide of midwicket for a single. That could be Tremlett's spell;
9.5;?;Tremlett to Clarke, no run this time Clarke leaves alone outside off. It's been a good over so far but Haddin's invention manes Clarke has time;
9.4;?;Tremlett to Clarke, no run that's a cracker from Tremlett. Finds a good length and it zips away past Clarke's groping outside edge;

9.2;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run Tremlett continues to bowl a length and this time Haddin is happy to block with soft hands for a single to cover;

8.5;?;Shahzad to Clarke, no run massive scream from Shahzad as Clarke outside edges a drive one-bounce to Yardy who is very deep at slip. Shahzad has a pop at Clarke and then one at Yardy for being too deep! He's very fired up;

7.6;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run Haddin aims a drive and it's a touch loose, sliding off the outer-half again to Bell sliding at point;
7.5;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run this skews off the outer-half of the bat down to point;
7.4;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run beaten outside off, fullish and nipped away. Haddin should have been forward and ended up hanging his bat outside off;
7.4;1w;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 wide well Tremlett shoves the down the leg side. Trying to make sure Haddin has no room to free his arms but he's overcooked it;
7.3;1;Tremlett to Clarke, 1 run back of a length this time and Clarke stands tall to work past a short leg for a single;
7.2;?;Tremlett to Clarke, no run fuller, Tremlett seems to lose devil when he goes full, just floats it up there but at this stage in Clarke's innings it's left alone;
7.1;?;Tremlett to Clarke, no run Tremlett is a man of fewer words and lands this on a length, Clarke eases back to defend;
6.6;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run full again and Haddin defends to cover. Plenty of chat out there;
6.5;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run full ball is dug out back to Shahzad who collects and threatens to knock Haddin's block off. Haddin responded but I can't say with what;
6.5;1w;Shahzad to Haddin, 1 wide shoved down the leg side this time;
6.4;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run big whoosh outside off, looks good if it connects, less so when you miss;
6.3;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run Haddin again aiming to slash over cover but this time it's bottom-edged and trickles to cover;
6.2;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run much fuller this time, Shahzad searches for a yorker and it's carefully defended;
6.1;4;Shahzad to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin is on the charge! Gives himself room again and eases his arms through the line, not perfectly timed but good enough to clear mid-off and run to the boundary;
5.6;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run Haddin has found his timing, even this back-foot defence speeds out to mid-off;
5.5;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run Tremlett's response is to bang it in short and Haddin had to hurry to get out the way;
5.4;4;Tremlett to Haddin, FOUR runs wow, Haddin got all of this! Skips down the wicket and leg side of the ball, got the length he wanted and sweetly thumped the ball over point;
5.3;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run shorter from Tremlett, in another mood Haddin would have a go but here he sways out the way;
5.2;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run touch of movement away from the bat, Haddin jumping back to defend with head over ball;

4.4;?;Shahzad to Clarke, no run gets a very, very short ball first up. Clarke could have jumped and avoided that;
4.3;W;Shahzad to Marsh, OUT massive appeal as Marsh is struck on the pad to a full ball. Eventually given out but Marsh has reviewed it... No inside edge, struck in front and hitting middle. So, both centurions have gone now. That stirs the pot!;Shaun Marsh lbw b Shahzad 6 (13m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50;
4.2;?;Shahzad to Marsh, no run Shahzad corrects his line, length too, and Marsh leaves alone;
4.2;1w;Shahzad to Marsh, 1 wide Shahzad from around the wicket digs in a short ball down the leg side. The umpire's don't like it, fair enough;
4.1;?;Shahzad to Marsh, no run some smart fielding, diving at point, saves this steer into the off side;
3.6;4;Tremlett to Haddin, FOUR runs and another, even better this time. On the up Haddin has punched a length ball, with perfect timing, wide of mid-off to the boundary;
3.5;4;Tremlett to Haddin, FOUR runs ah lovely shot, the best of Haddin, sweetly timed past a diving point fielder for four. There was the slightest hint on offer and he took full advantage;
3.4;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run Haddin is playing back to a ball he should be forward at which makes his defence looked jabbed;
3.3;1;Tremlett to Marsh, 1 run Tremlett lands it on a good length and it hurries onto Marsh who defends with soft hands;
3.2;?;Tremlett to Marsh, no run beaten outside off stump. Back of a length around off and Marsh flirted at it;
3.2;1w;Tremlett to Marsh, 1 wide touch of swing here into Marsh, who shuffled across his stumps and missed a leg-side work, it went pretty much over leg stump and was called wide. Harsh call;
3.1;?;Tremlett to Marsh, no run big grunt from Tremlett as he delivers, but that's the main event as an off-stump ball is left alone outside off;
2.6;1;Shahzad to Marsh, 1 run on the legs again, England tried this approach the last game and Marsh made 110, this is worked again around the corner;
2.5;4;Shahzad to Marsh, FOUR runs too full and the line is wrong, on the pads, Marsh's pick-up flick of the wrists is perfectly timed and it speeds to the square-leg rope;
2.4;?;Shahzad to Marsh, no run Marsh works this from around off stump to backwards square where some sliding fielding prevents one;
2.3;?;Shahzad to Marsh, no run pushed across Marsh here and left all alone;

2.1;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run plenty of chat from the England fielders, I reckon they got a rocket from Strauss at the break. Shahzad is again outside off stump and Haddin leaves alone;
1.6;?;Tremlett to Marsh, no run fuller and whipped off the pads to square leg, where Morgan slides to field well and aim a throw at the striker's end. Marsh was out of his crease then;
1.5;?;Tremlett to Marsh, no run good first ball to Marsh, on a length and and bouncing a touch, gets Marsh in an uncomfortable position as he tried to defend;
1.4;W;Tremlett to Watson, OUT this time he's gone! Same spot, full and nipped back a touch. Watson aimed a booming drive but it was through that gate and pinged the top of off. Tremlett is fired up and sends Watson on his way;Shane Watson b Tremlett 9 (7m 7b 2x4 0x6) SR: 128.57;
1.3;4;Tremlett to Watson, FOUR runs oh that is far, far too close! It was fuller from Tremlett and flew off this inside edge this far wide of leg stump and ran away for four;
1.2;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run back onto a good length and line this time. Watson very correct in defence;
1.2;1w;Tremlett to Watson, 1 wide this is very wide of off stump, Watson had a slash but didn't connect;
1.1;?;Tremlett to Watson, no run Tremlett trundles in and bangs it down just short of a length, that's the place for him to bowl and the bounce takes it past the defence onto the pads;
0.6;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run this time it's left alone outside off stump. Welcome sighter for Haddin;
0.5;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run lovely delivery from Shahzad, nipped back from a length through bat and pad and struck Haddin high on the back leg;
0.4;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run Haddin has been struggling for form and misses out on a leg-side fiddle here. Thuds off the pads;
0.3;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run ooh, almost another chop on as Watson tried to cut a ball that was too close to him. Came off the bottom edge and bounced through to Prior;
