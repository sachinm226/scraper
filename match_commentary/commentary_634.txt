Data
Australia fight back well to keep Sri Lanka down to 226 inside 50 overs, nipping out seven wickets for 69 runs at the end. They do come hard at you, these Australians. Jayawardene and Silva forged a 140-run fourth-wicket stand to lift Sri Lanka, but Australia will fancy themselves to chase down 227 with an attack missing Vaas, Malinga and Murali. Do join me in about 40 minutes - 13:40 local, 17:40 GMT - for the second innings.

Australia just too good for anyone. Not one team has bothered them all tournament. You're going to need a lot to beat this team, A-game, B-game, call if what you will. Dismissed Sri Lanka cheaply, knocked off the runs without breaking a sweat, and I want to see what team beats Australia.
Do join us for tomorrow's much-hyped affair, England v South Africa at Bridgetown, at 13:30 GMT. Thats all from me, Jamie Alter. Good night/morning/evening/afternoon, wherever you may be. Cheers!
