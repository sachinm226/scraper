Data
That is a poor display from the hosts and Australia were rather hot and cold in the field, taking a couple of very goodgrabs, while also putting down a couple. Clarke had a difficult time with a couple of misfields too.
The players now take their tea. I suspect it will taste a lot better for the Australian's who shocked the hosts with genuine pace up front and they were never able to recover.
Join us in 10 minutes as Australia begin their chase, needing just 119 to win.

Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of Australia's tour of New Zealand, which begins with today's Twenty20 in Wellington. The news at the Westpac Stadium is that Daniel Vettori has won the toss and New Zealand will bat.
In team news Southee is 12th man for the hosts with Hopkins getting the nod at number six. While for Australia, Steven Smith retains his spot at number 7, as does Dan Christian at number 9 wth Johnson, Tait and Nannes rounding out the bowlers. Ryan Harris is 12th man.
The conditions are outstanding here in Wellington. After a few showers overnight, the weather cleared early in the day to give us bright sunshine with a temperature of around 22-24 degrees C.
The curator has left quite a bit of grass on the pitch which should mean it plays nice and fast. It has been browned off nicely, so ideally we won't see too much seam movement.
A lot of talk during the week has focused on David Warner and his switch-hit so we await his innings eagerly to see what kind of performance he will provide for the fans here in Wellington.
Warner is still seeking clarification from the ICC regarding the legality of the switch-hit but by all accounts it looks as though he will take the law into his own hands.
Tait is at the top of his mark.
Australia come into the series bouyant after an unbeaten summer at home against Pakistan and West Indies while the Black Caps haven't had a lot of cricket of late, with a tour from Bangladesh over the last few weeks their only lead up.
The seats are slowly filling up here at the 'Cake Tin,' as Westpac Stadium is commonly referred to, and lets hope the public get out in support of what promises to be a mouth watering contest between these two bitter rivals.
My name is Marc Ellison, I will be bringing you live commentary and we have Venkat Raghav scoring for us in the engine room.
Brendon McCullum and Peter Ingram face up to a three-prong pace attack for Australia. It will be interesting to see what kind of speeds Shaun Tait will reach this evening.
 Innings Start
Australia just far too good for New Zealand tonight, winning by six wickets with 24 balls to spare.
David Hussey is happy with his team's effort and enjoyed the pace in the wicket which allowed him to score 46 off 36 balls. He hit nicely over the top straight down the ground and pulled strongly whenever the bowlers dropped short.
New Zealand were undone by the pace of Tait, Nannes and Johnson atth top of the innings and were chasing their tails as a result for the rest of the innings, eventually being bowled out for 118 from the final ball fo the innings.
Australia's reply never looked in doubt with Warner and Watson getting away to a flier before Bond and Vettori pegged it back. Hussey struck a neat 46 while captain Clarke worked the ball into the gaps without taking too many risks to finish 18 not out.
Vettori is confident his side can get it right for the next match in Christchurch on Sunday but isn't looking forward to bowling with the short boundaries straight down the ground.
Clarke is ecstatic with his pacemen and the batting form of Warner and Watson. He feels the team are hungry to be here in New Zealand and with everyone competing for spots, he feels his side stands in good stead looking forward.
Mitchell Johnson is named Man of the Match for his three for 19 off four overs. He picked up the wickets of Ingram, Taylor and Guptill which dented any momentum New Zealand would've hoped for up front.
We look ahead to Sunday now where the series moves to Christchurch for the second and final T20 international. Thanks for joining us here for live coverage of tonights match. Please join us again at 1400 NZDST or 0200 GMT on Sunday.
This is Marc Ellison signing off. Goodluck and god speed.

Australia just far too good for New Zealand tonight, winning by six wickets with 24 balls to spare.
David Hussey is happy with his team's effort and enjoyed the pace in the wicket which allowed him to score 46 off 36 balls. He hit nicely over the top straight down the ground and pulled strongly whenever the bowlers dropped short.
New Zealand were undone by the pace of Tait, Nannes and Johnson atth top of the innings and were chasing their tails as a result for the rest of the innings, eventually being bowled out for 118 from the final ball fo the innings.
Australia's reply never looked in doubt with Warner and Watson getting away to a flier before Bond and Vettori pegged it back. Hussey struck a neat 46 while captain Clarke worked the ball into the gaps without taking too many risks to finish 18 not out.
Vettori is confident his side can get it right for the next match in Christchurch on Sunday but isn't looking forward to bowling with the short boundaries straight down the ground.
Clarke is ecstatic with his pacemen and the batting form of Warner and Watson. He feels the team are hungry to be here in New Zealand and with everyone competing for spots, he feels his side stands in good stead looking forward.
Mitchell Johnson is named Man of the Match for his three for 19 off four overs. He picked up the wickets of Ingram, Taylor and Guptill which dented any momentum New Zealand would've hoped for up front.
We look ahead to Sunday now where the series moves to Christchurch for the second and final T20 international. Thanks for joining us here for live coverage of tonights match. Please join us again at 1400 NZDST or 0200 GMT on Sunday.
