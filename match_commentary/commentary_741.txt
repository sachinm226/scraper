And that's lunch on day one - not the fairly tale start that the fans would have hoped for but the Bangladesh batsmen are hanging in there, Gillespie was right on the money from the word go and Bangladesh were soon reduced to 41 for 4 in just 14 overs.
Gillespie was the wrecker-in-chief, so far he has picked up three wickets and Warne chipped in with the wicket of Mohammad Ashraful.
First session clearly belonged to the visitors, we will be back in 40 minutes time (6:40 GMT) with the post lunch session, do join us then
Start of the post lunch session has been delayed due to some crowd trouble, not sure what really happened but the news is that play will be delayed by at least 10 minutes!
Finally the umpires appear, followed by the Australian team - play should resume any minute now.
`Warne to continue - Aftab Ahmed on strike.
Slip, gully and a short leg in place.
