Data
So Australia end on an imposing 306 for 6 in their 50 overs. Like in Bangalore they recovered from a shaky start. From 8 for 2, Symonds and Hayden propped them up before Haddin provided the finishing touches with a valuable 87.
India's bowlers threatened in phases but the Australian batting proved too strong yet again. They were done in by the rain in the first match but will hope to wrap this one up without much fuss. However India have chased 300-plus targets in the past and there is also a small matter of rain hovering around.
Join us in a while for the second innings. Kanishkaa will take you through the early overs of India's run-chase
49.6;1;Sreesanth to Lee, 1 run yorker length, dug out for a single.;
49.6;5w;Sreesanth to Lee, 5 wide fast and furious at 140kph, way down leg side and it races away for four wides. Adam Gilchrist applauds from the dressing-room.;
49.5;1;Sreesanth to Haddin, 1 run another slower one, full and straight, driven powerfully to long-on but he can't get the elevation and has to settle for one;
49.4;1;Sreesanth to Lee, 1 run slower ball, crunched to the off side but just a single;
49.3;1;Sreesanth to Haddin, 1 run yorker this time and Haddin can't get proper hold of it.;
49.2;W;Sreesanth to Hopes, OUT slower ball works this time, outside off and Hopes slashes wildly, straight to Dravid at extra cover. High Hopes crash. Local boy Sreesanth has three wickets now. His aim was to get five. He has four balls left to achieve it.;James Hopes c Dravid b Sreesanth 4 (11m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
49.1;2;Sreesanth to Hopes, 2 runs full and on the pads, flicked away to midwicket for a couple;
48.6;4;Khan to Haddin, FOUR runs That's as cute as it gets. Twenty20 stuff from Haddin. Full toss on middle from Zaheer and Haddin moves across and scoops it past fine leg. He gets hold of it and it races away for four. Premidated and efficient. Haddin hurting India here;
48.5;?;Khan to Haddin, no run;
48.5;1w;Khan to Haddin, 1 wide too far outside off and Haddin, trying to swish it to the leg side, can afford to miss it. It's called wide;
48.4;6;Khan to Haddin, SIX runs Slow ball after slow ball and one's going to go outside the ground. Haddin middles that and deposits it miles over midwicket. It's cleared many stands. Scattered the crowd even.;
48.3;4;Khan to Haddin, FOUR runs full toss this time and Haddin smacks it down the ground for a four. Two fielders converge, one dives but it doesn't matter.;
48.2;1;Khan to Hopes, 1 run backs away and tries to slog it but can't get hold of a low full toss, skied to long-off and it drops short of the fielder;
48.1;1;Khan to Haddin, 1 run slow ball for Zaheer, cut away to point for a single. He's done a fine job towards the end here;
45.6;1;Khan to Symonds, 1 run full and straight on the pads, dug out to long-on for a single. Fine over from Zaheer, mixing up his pace and length intelligently. India need more of the same.;
45.5;?;Khan to Symonds, no run slower one this time, 105kph and Symonds can't adjust his shot in the last moment, tries to cut but he's too early;
45.4;1;Khan to Haddin, 1 run full and straight again, drilled to long-off for a single. Pathan is quick, keeps them down to one;
45.3;?;Khan to Haddin, no run yorker length ball again, good stuff from Zaheer, Haddin tries to go straight but can only dribble it back to the bowler;
45.2;1;Khan to Symonds, 1 run round the wicket this time, short and directed at the ribs, Symonds pulls but can only get a single to deep square leg;
45.1;1;Khan to Haddin, 1 run pulled away to midwicket, they go for a quick single and Harbhajan goes for the direct hit. One stump to aim at and he misses. Had he hit, Haddin was gone;
44.6;1lb;Sreesanth to Haddin, 1 leg bye worked away for an extra;
44.5;4;Sreesanth to Haddin, FOUR runs creamed through extra cover for four, that's a full-blooded drive. So many words being exchanged, yet Haddin has played a super shot here;
44.4;2;Sreesanth to Haddin, 2 runs;
44.3;?;Sreesanth to Haddin, no run Slower ball that Haddin tries to pull, misses completely and Sreesanth runs up to field the ball. A few words exchanged and there's more drama here. Sreesanth appeals to the umpire (one thinks for running out Symonds at the non-striker's end) and there are a few words exchanged with Symonds as well. The umpire ponders a bit before Dhoni calms everything down by going up to Sreesanth and telling him to stop the appeal. Sense prevailed in the end, one hopes;
44.2;4;Sreesanth to Haddin, FOUR runs Too easy, full and straight and Haddin goes straight, on the back foot and thumping down the ground for a superb four. He's negating all the swing by standing outside the crease. Actually the only swing present there concerns the bat.;
44.1;1;Sreesanth to Symonds, 1 run full one from Sreesanth, driven powerfully by Symonds, through extra cover for a single. They look for two but the fielder is alert enough to get the throw back in fast;
47.6;1;Yuvraj to Haddin, 1 run Reverse-sweep comes out. He can't get the placement, though, and smacks it straight to short third man (or short fine leg if you prefer);
47.5;2;Yuvraj to Haddin, 2 runs slower this time and Haddin tries to pull, under-edge this time and past the keeper for two. Outside edge done, inside edge done, what ya got left?;
47.4;4;Yuvraj to Haddin, FOUR runs some turn for Yuvraj there, Haddin gets a thick edge past the keeper for four, Yuvraj beat him with spin there but you expect this in the final stages of a one-dayer;
47.3;?;Yuvraj to Haddin, no run;
47.2;1;Yuvraj to Hopes, 1 run turned away to the on side;
47.1;1;Yuvraj to Haddin, 1 run Tapped away to the off side for a single;
46.6;1;Sreesanth to Haddin, 1 run Keeps the strike with a push to cover;
46.5;W;Sreesanth to Symonds, OUT another slower one and this time he strikes. It's full on leg stump and Symonds tries to smack it over midwicket, only manages to get a leading edge that balloons up high in the air. Sreesanth gets himself under it and completes a smart catch. Sreesanth celebrates with a leer, Symonds has a few words, Dravid intervenes and all, we hope, is well with the world. Fine innings from Symonds. It could end up being a matchwinning effort.;Andrew Symonds c & b Sreesanth 87 (131m 83b 9x4 2x6) SR: 104.81;
46.4;1;Sreesanth to Haddin, 1 run Full toss this time and that too on the pads but Haddin doesn't get hold of it, straight to the fielder;
46.3;4;Sreesanth to Haddin, FOUR runs too predictable this time. A slower one again, ends up as a low full toss and Haddin swishes it over midwicket for four.;
46.2;?;Sreesanth to Haddin, no run Another slower ball, Sreesanth doing this well, Haddin lines up for a mighty heave-ho over midwicket but is too early on the shot, that nearly went onto the stumps;
46.1;1;Sreesanth to Symonds, 1 run full and outside off, Symonds tries to make room but can't get the elevation, tapped to the off side and they complete a quick single;
43.6;1;Khan to Symonds, 1 run Down the ground again but settles for the single. Keeps the strike.;
43.5;4;Khan to Symonds, FOUR runs full length ball but that was creamed away with immense power, down the ground past the bowler for another four. He didn't middle it really but when has that ever been the criterion in the modern age? Bring on those heavy bats;
43.4;4;Khan to Symonds, FOUR runs Full pitched ball outside off, sliced away by Symonds, past point and wide of third man for a four. This man is dangerous in these phases. Pumping iron almost;
43.3;1;Khan to Haddin, 1 run Good ball again, over the wicket and yorker length again. Haddin seems comfortable taking the single and handing over strike to Symonds.;
43.2;1;Khan to Symonds, 1 run Symonds backs away and charges too, blasted away to long-off but straight to the fielder. Australia will look to launch towards 300 now.;
43.1;1;Khan to Haddin, 1 run yorker from Zaheer, Hadden is forced to dig it out towards the off side, that's the length India need at the moment.;
42.6;1;Sreesanth to Haddin, 1 run pushed to long-off efficiently;
42.5;1;Sreesanth to Symonds, 1 run another slower one, legcutter again, pushed away to the leg side. Sreesanth has a word with Symonds. It turns into several words. Symonds reponds. A smile is exchanged.;
42.4;?;Sreesanth to Symonds, no run slower one that time, 100kph, Symonds has to wait for an age for that and cuts it straight to point. Sreesanth doing a good job now;
42.3;1;Sreesanth to Haddin, 1 run slightly slower one, Haddin cautiously pats it to the off side for a single;
42.2;1;Sreesanth to Symonds, 1 run short of a length, outside off, Symonds backs away and thinks of swatting it away but can't get the timing on it;

41.6;1;Harbhajan to Haddin, 1 run another fired in delivery, low full toss for a single down the ground;
41.5;4;Harbhajan to Haddin, FOUR runs attempted leg-stump yorker but Haddin is quick to pounce on it, glancing it fine, past Dhoni and past short fine leg for four. It was a really quick one and ran away to the fence;
41.4;1;Harbhajan to Symonds, 1 run fired in on the pads but Symonds is up to the task, whips it away behind square for a single;
41.3;1;Harbhajan to Haddin, 1 run another low full toss from Harbhajan, gently tapped away to midwicket by Haddin;

41.1;1;Harbhajan to Haddin, 1 run Worked away for an easy single to the leg side;
40.6;?;Khan to Symonds, no run holds it back a bit and short of a length. Ball stopping on the batsmen a bit now. Symonds tries to cut but can't make contact. Sign of a two-paced pitch for the second innings?;
40.5;1;Khan to Haddin, 1 run outside off and angled away to third man, there's a fielder inside the circle but it beats him. Simple single there;
40.4;1;Khan to Symonds, 1 run glided away to third man for a single;
40.3;2;Khan to Symonds, 2 runs clattered away with a horizontal bat down the ground, racing away four four but stopped well for Gambhir at long-on;
40.2;?;Khan to Symonds, no run short of a length and outside off, ball stopping on Symonds and he tries to cut it away but can't get the timing right. Inside edge could have gone on to the stumps but goes to Dhoni;

39.2;?;Harbhajan to Haddin, no run played back to the bowler;
39.1;6;Harbhajan to Haddin, SIX runs flighted on off and Haddin gives it the royal whack, gets down on his knee and slog sweeps over deep midwicket;

37.4;4;Pathan to Haddin, FOUR runs outside off and Haddin slashes that past the slip region, the ball gets the top half of the bat and races away;

37.1;1;Pathan to Symonds, 1 run;
36.6;1;Yuvraj to Symonds, 1 run;
36.5;1;Yuvraj to Haddin, 1 run played to the off side;

34.3;2;Harbhajan to Haddin, 2 runs;
34.2;6;Harbhajan to Haddin, SIX runs Haddin decides enough is enough and slog sweeps over deep midwicket, the best part was he stayed rooted to the crease while playing that;

30.1;1;Tendulkar to Hayden, 1 run fired inm outside off, Hayden gives it his all and cuts fiercely;
29.6;1;Powar to Hayden, 1 run on the pads and turned away for a single. Easy like Andy. Six and a few singles. Thanks very much. Okeydokey.;

29.4;1;Powar to Hayden, 1 run moves away and axed down the ground for a single;

29.2;?;Powar to Hayden, no run;
29.1;6;Powar to Hayden, SIX runs Thwack! Down the ground and pumelled away way over midwicket for a big six. Powar tossed that up and Hayden, as if swallowing a lollypop, smoted that;

28.5;?;Tendulkar to Symonds, no run;
28.4;?;Tendulkar to Symonds, no run on the short side again, Symonds gets a thick edge that goes towards point;

28.2;1;Tendulkar to Symonds, 1 run short and slightly wide, cut away effortlessly past point for a single;
28.1;4;Tendulkar to Symonds, FOUR runs quicker one, bowled from a medium-pacer's action almost and Symonds cutely paddles it to fine leg for a four. Deliberately played and the ball beats the slow outfield to race away.;
27.6;1;Powar to Symonds, 1 run driven to wide long-off for a single;
27.5;?;Powar to Symonds, no run;
27.4;1;Powar to Hayden, 1 run;
27.3;1;Powar to Symonds, 1 run;
27.2;?;Powar to Symonds, no run 83.6kph, Symonds down the ground and back to the bowler. Powar varying his pace is quite a handful to play.;
27.1;?;Powar to Symonds, no run drifting down leg, patted away to the on side;
26.6;?;Tendulkar to Hayden, no run cut to backward point. Good end to the over, he seemed to be finding some rhythm there.;
26.5;?;Tendulkar to Hayden, no run pushed down the ground;
26.4;1;Tendulkar to Symonds, 1 run another wide one and Symonds goes for the cut again but can't get the placement. Manages a single. Karthik diving around quite needlessly. Wonder who's paying the laundry bills;
26.3;1;Tendulkar to Hayden, 1 run wide of the stumps and cut away to deep point for a single;
26.2;1;Tendulkar to Symonds, 1 run short again, outside off and Symonds goes for the savage cut. Straight to the point fielder though and a misfield allows them to take a quick single;
26.1;4;Tendulkar to Symonds, FOUR runs and he's been carted to midwicket first up. A long-hop to start with and Symonds pulls violently to midwicket for four. Well begun is ...;
25.6;?;Powar to Hayden, no run that's really well bowled. Sees Hayden showing signs of coming down the track and pushes it through faster. Hayden changes his mind and tries to glide it to third man but is beaten.;
25.5;1;Powar to Symonds, 1 run better line it seems, Symonds down the track but can only manage a single.;
25.4;?;Powar to Symonds, no run slow and teasing, that's what he's good at, tapped away to the off side;
25.3;1;Powar to Hayden, 1 run swept away past short fine leg for a single. Powar drifting too much down leg in this spell. Those red goggles are not working today, it seems;
25.2;?;Powar to Hayden, no run;
25.1;?;Powar to Hayden, no run short and slow, cut away to the off side but straight to the fielder;
24.6;?;Harbhajan to Symonds, no run fired in, pushed to mid-on;

24.3;1;Harbhajan to Symonds, 1 run flatter on off and Symonds pushes behind square for a quick single;
24.2;1;Harbhajan to Hayden, 1 run Tapped away for a single. It's amazing how often the Aussies take a single after they've managed a boundary;
24.1;6;Harbhajan to Hayden, SIX runs That's a screamer. Hayden simply gets down on his haunches and whistles that over midwicket for a big six. Harbhajan isn't saying much now. Hayden in such form is best left alone. And by the way he's brought up his fifty. Raises the bat as if to say, 'Now that's just the first course';
23.6;1;Powar to Hayden, 1 run;
23.5;?;Powar to Hayden, no run big appeal but that was likely to miss the off stump. Powar is bowling over the wicket but that pitched on line. Problem was it was turning away and would have missed off. Hayden can't make contact while sweeping but he was safe that time;
23.4;4;Powar to Hayden, FOUR runs tossed up on legstump and Hayden smacks his lips, gets on his haunches and sweeps savagely to fine leg for a four. Suddenly batting looks much easier than earlier;
23.3;?;Powar to Hayden, no run slower through the air, Hayden on the back foot and slightly poking towards the off side;
23.2;1;Powar to Symonds, 1 run too easy this, driven to long-on for another single;
23.1;1;Powar to Hayden, 1 run Confident push down the ground. Hayden working this to a plan;
22.6;2;Harbhajan to Symonds, 2 runs Sensible paddle on the leg side for an easy two. Symonds is mixing gentle touches with brute force effectively. It's difficult to bowl to batsmen when they know when to slap and when to caress.;
22.5;1;Harbhajan to Hayden, 1 run Nudged away to the leg side for a quick one;
22.4;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run bit of extra bounce for Harbhajan, defended cautiously down the ground. It's obvious that Hayden is biding his time and Symonds is going for it;
22.3;1;Harbhajan to Symonds, 1 run firm drive to long-on;
22.2;1;Harbhajan to Hayden, 1 run pushed down the ground for a single;
22.1;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run Hayden edges to the off side but doesn't want the single. Symonds is halfway down the pitch and slips slightly too but Uthappa juggles and doesn't get the throw in time. Opportunity squandered for India;
21.6;6;Powar to Symonds, SIX runs Bang! Another slower one but this time Symonds decides enough is enough. Down the ground and scooped way over midwicket for a big one. He's launching the assault now. And it's just the 22nd over.;
21.5;?;Powar to Symonds, no run Change of pace. In the late 70s this time. Symonds has no pace to work on and pushes it to the off side;
21.4;1;Powar to Hayden, 1 run 86.7kph that time and tapped away to the off side for a single;
21.3;?;Powar to Hayden, no run slow one on middle and spinning away to off, left alone;
21.2;2;Powar to Hayden, 2 runs sweep this time, well struck and picks up two to fine leg;
21.1;?;Powar to Hayden, no run slow start as expected, Padded away by Hayden. Exaggerated stride forward and a gentle kick.;
20.6;?;Harbhajan to Symonds, no run quicker one and straight, tapped away to the leg side;
20.6;1w;Harbhajan to Symonds, 1 wide sharp offbreak, turning from middle to leg and wide is called;
20.5;?;Harbhajan to Symonds, no run flatter and quicker on the pads, dribbled away to the leg side;
20.4;?;Harbhajan to Symonds, no run full and straight. A dart almost. Pushed back to the bowler;
20.3;?;Harbhajan to Symonds, no run;
20.2;6;Harbhajan to Symonds, SIX runs Crack! Down the pitch he comes and pulps that over deep long-on for a big one. Symonds not looking back anymore. These are meaty blows. Bring on the wild pigs, he seems to be saying;
20.1;1;Harbhajan to Hayden, 1 run Hayden tries to open up his shoulders now. These two complement each other well. Uppish cut but it's short of the fielder at point. They scramble a single;
19.6;4;Pathan to Symonds, FOUR runs And that's brutal. Two cute glides followed by a rapacious slap. Too short, too wide and Symonds isn't going to miss out on that one. Creams it past cover for four. Pathan finally stops smiling. It's been that kind of over;
19.5;4;Pathan to Symonds, FOUR runs This one is deliberate. On middle and off and Symonds opens the face of the bat and glides it to third man for another four. Words exchanged but that was really well played. A big man luke Symonds can do cute bits too;
19.4;?;Pathan to Symonds, no run good retort from the bowler. Good length ball on off and moving in a shade. Symonds in a quandary whether to hit or defend. Ends up in knots.;
19.3;4;Pathan to Symonds, FOUR runs short of a length and outside off, Symonds gets a thickish edge that races away to third man for four. Not in control but runs are runs. Pathan smiles that cherubic smile.;
19.2;1;Pathan to Hayden, 1 run;
19.1;?;Pathan to Hayden, no run;
18.6;?;Harbhajan to Symonds, no run drifting down leg, Symonds misses;
18.5;2;Harbhajan to Symonds, 2 runs Symonds charges down the ground again and lofts over extra cover. Doesn't get the timing right and they manage a couple. These two are so powerful that under-edges usually go for six but they're yet to get into full flow.;
18.4;1;Harbhajan to Hayden, 1 run;
18.3;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run more shouldering of arms. Hayden playing it safe here. Biding his time for the assault. At the moment, though, it appears to be some deoderant advert.;
18.2;1;Harbhajan to Symonds, 1 run Bit more intent from Symonds. That was slightly tossed up again and he charges down and pushes it to long-on. Australia need a move along.;
18.1;?;Harbhajan to Symonds, no run lobbed up on off, not much turn but Symonds decides to push it back down the ground to the bowler;
17.6;?;Pathan to Hayden, no run just outside off and left alone. Pathan is garnering Hayden's respect. Arms shouldered;
17.5;?;Pathan to Hayden, no run that's the one, good length ball on and around off. Hayden pats it to cover and goes about practising the stroke again.;
17.4;1;Pathan to Symonds, 1 run short and wide but Symonds doesn't cash in as he should. Slapped away but straight to third man for a single. Pathan might be better off keeping it straight and simple.;
17.3;?;Pathan to Symonds, no run full and on the off stump, driven confidently to cover but straight to the fielder;
17.2;?;Pathan to Symonds, no run defended to the off side. straight one again;

16.6;?;Harbhajan to Symonds, no run Slightly slower one from Harbhajan, 60mph on that occassion. Draws Symonds forward and has him poking at it. Bobs up on the leg side but short of the fielder. No run that time;

16.3;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run another quicker one, left alone by Hayden. Good pace variation by Harbhajan;

16.1;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run slightly short and cut away fiercely but it's straight to the cover fielder. Hayden practises the shot. Slip in place by the way;
15.6;?;Pathan to Symonds, no run straight and good length again, 131kph and no room to free the arms. That's what he did so well in the World Twenty20 and he's continuing the same here.;
15.5;?;Pathan to Symonds, no run Dhoni comes up again. Straight ball that time and Symonds plays it cautiously down the ground;
15.4;?;Pathan to Symonds, no run Beaten first up. 131kph from Irfan and Symonds tries to angle his bat cutely. Can't read the seam movement and the ball goes through to Dhoni.;
15.4;W;Pathan to Clarke, 1 wide, OUT got 'em! Great work by Dhoni behind the stumps. That was a poor ball down leg side but Clarke can't get hold of the flick and over-balances after the stroke. Dhoni, standing up to the stumps, collects it nearly and flicks off the bails in a flash. Easy decision for the umpire that time and Pathan hugs Dhoni as if he's some long lost lover. Was it a poor ball or good judgement? What matters is he's got a wicket. Pup goes the Clarke. Drama! Suresh Shastri, the square leg umpire, lifted his finger but appears to have consulted the third umpire in the last moment. Clarke is waiting in the boundary. It looks out but there's still debating. The giant screen finally shows the verdict: OUT and Clarke is on his way. His back foot was on the line there and as everyone famously proclaims: "The line belongs to the umpire". He even takes it home when stumps are drawn.;Michael Clarke st ?Dhoni b Pathan 27 (59m 38b 3x4 0x6) SR: 71.05;
15.3;1;Pathan to Hayden, 1 run quick single from Hayden this time, direct hit would have been close but Karthik misses;

Toss: Mahendra Singh Dhoni has won the toss and India will bowl first. Not very surprising, given the damp conditions. Dhoni said he wanted his bowlers to make best use of the moisture on the surface.
Team news: India have made a couple of changes, bringing in Harbhajan Singh for RP Singh. That makes two specialist spinners, alongwith Ramesh Powar. Robin Uthappa comes in for Sourav Ganguly, sitting out of this match because of a hamstring injury.
Australia are unchanged from the first game. Still no Ricky Ponting though.
India: 1 Sachin Tendulkar, 2 Gautam Gambhir, 3 Robin Uthappa, 4 Yuvraj Singh, 5 Rahul Dravid, 6 Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt/wk), 7 Irfan Pathan, 8 Harbhajan Singh, 9 Ramesh Powar 10 Zaheer Khan, 11 Sreesanth
Australia: 1 Adam Gilchrist (capt/wk), 2 Matthew Hayden, 3 Brad Hodge, 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Andrew Symonds, 6 Brad Haddin, 7 James Hopes, 8 Brad Hogg, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Stuart Clark
9.05: The umpires Steve Bucknor and Suresh Shastri have said that the toss will happen at 9.15. That's a 45-minute delay.
Pitch and outfield: The outfield is in fairly good shape, thanks to the spectacular work of the ground staff using innovative methods like fire to dry it up. However, the pitch is a little damp and that's holding up the start. There are a few cracks around, bringing the slow men into play.
We did mention earlier that there would be an inspection at 9.00, about 15 minutes from now. More details to follow. In the meantime, you may read Jamie's preview of the game.
Jamie, or 'Jammubhai' as he is otherwise known, also wrote about India's need for rotation
. Funny, not too long ago we all laughed at the Australians for constantly rotating their players for whatever reason. Now, it's the 'in' thing to do.
8.28 local time: Dileep Premachandran, one half of our dynamic duo at the ground, says that the players have gone through their warm-ups. We have news now that a pitch inspection has been scheduled for 9.00 local time. What this means is that the toss has been delayed by half an hour, at least.
Now Jamie Alter, the other half of the duo, makes his observations: "The gates were open as early as 4 am here in Kochi, and by 8.15 the stadium had filled up sizeably with many still flocking in. A jam-packed stadium, replete with chendas, local miniature drums, have added to the hype of what should be a cracker of a contest."
He adds: "And while it's warm outside, the press enclosure is like a fridge. Its freezing in here." Well we know how humid Kochi can get, so hang in there guys....
Well after the scenes yesterday, it's quite a miracle really that we're actually talking about getting a game, let alone hope for a 20-over shootout. The Met department did forecast rain for today. No evidence of that now, for sure.
Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the second ODI between India and Australia in Kochi. I am Kanishkaa Balachandran, your commentator for the moment. Siddhartha Vaidyanathan will join us later.
The main, and probably the only talking point right now is the weather. There is bright sunshine at the moment at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. The covers are off and our sources at the ground have informed us that there is a very good chance of getting a game.
 Innings Start
So that ends what's been a largely one-sided clash with Australia taking a 1-0 lead. They posted a 300-plus score for the second successive game and recovered from a shaky start as they had done in Bangalore.
Chasing 307 was never going to be easy and India's top-order wobble meant they were always playing catch up. The Australians bowled with discipline and fielded with energy and the spinners finally sealed the issue on a wearing pitch.
There will be talk about India's decision at the toss but Australia were no doubt the better team overall. The series now moves to Hyderabad where the team clash in the third one-dayer on October 5.
Thank you for joining us for this one. From me, Siddhartha Vaidyanathan, and my fellow commentator Kanishkaa Balachandran it's good night and good luck.

46.4;?;Hopes to Dhoni, no run smacked down to long-off but he doesn't take a single;
46.3;?;Hopes to Dhoni, no run That's a KO. Full and straight, Dhoni cracks it powerfully and knocks Sreesanth out cold. He can't get out of the way, in the non-striker's end, and seems to have suffered a serious blow to the head. The Australian fielders are surrounding him and he's getting some treatment now. That would have been painful, especially in front of his home crowd. He's back up now and even manages a smile. Wants to bat on. Now that gets a cheer from the Kochi crowd.;

26.6;W;Clarke to Dhoni, OUT Now that's reckless. Another wicket goes down and this time to a run-out. Dhoni worked it to the on side and thought of a single. Pathan was too far down the track when he was sent back. Hogg flung it back to the bowler, who collected and back-flicked it onto the stumps in one motion.

25.2;1;Hogg to Dhoni, 1 run;
25.1;W;Hogg to Dravid, OUT That's the sort of catch that wins matches. Mitchell Johnson, almost like a ballerina, judges a skier to perfection and produces a YouTube moment. Dravid launches into a slog sweep, it goes high towards midwicket and the crowd is already cheering the six when Johnson gets under it, watches it closely, holds on and maintains his balance brilliantly. He was inches from the ropes but kept his poise. Super catch.;Rahul Dravid c Johnson b Hogg 31 (57m 48b 3x4 1x6) SR: 64.58;

21.1;?;Hopes to Dhoni, no run Nagging line again, Dhoni can't get the timing right, only manages a thick inside edge;
20.6;2;Clarke to Dravid, 2 runs turned to the fine-leg region for a couple. Five off the over, Australia will take that for the part-timer. It's the fifth bowler option and India need to do their bit to exploit that.;

18.6;?;Clark to Dravid, no run fuller this time but wide of the stumps and Dravid, almost as if he's in a shell, can't make contact. These overs could hurt India later. Australia sitting pretty as of now. Will the fifth bowler make the difference?;

16.3;1lb;Clark to Dravid, 1 leg bye Close shave for Dravid there, he pushed it to the leg side and took off for a single but ambled towards the end of it. Gilchrist, in a smart move, fired in a direct hit at the non-striker's end and Dravid just made it there. Another second or so and he was gone.;

Thanks Sid. India did chase over 300 in this ground, back in 2000 against South Africa, and it was a nail-biter. The pitch did appear a little two-paced so run scoring won't be very easy.
We're back. Brett Lee has the new ball. Gambhir will take first strike. Two slips in place
