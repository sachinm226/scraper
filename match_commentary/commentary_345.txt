Data
And that's the declaration from Michael Clarke, he's happy with 527 for 7. So it was a brief stint after tea and England will have 32 overs to face today. The follow-on target is 328. All eyes now switch to Harris, Siddle, Starc and Lyon v England's top order. Should be an added edge to the next couple of hours. This was a textbook Test innings from Australia; a solid opening stand, a big hundred by a member of the top order and contributions from others. After their problems in the first two Tests it has been a mighty impressive turnaround. Now it's down to the bowlers to try and keep the Ashes alive.
Gautam: "Difference between Clarke and Cook: Cook would have batted till England went past 600. Talks a lot about their captaincy styles." Yes, but many ways to skin a cat

Here's Dan, with his dander up: "There has been much negativity about this Australian squad but in reality they're not that bad - they just needed to find their groove and maybe, just maybe, they have. We have some runs (finally) now we need to take the wickets! I know - stating the obvious :-)"
 Innings Start
David Warner, who took that catch, then raced off the field. Maybe he will open? That would be fun. Australia's lead is 159. There are 68 overs left today and 90 tomorrow - weather permitting. England have battled hard to reach 368, but if they are being brutally honest with themselves something around 450 should have been in their grasp on this surface. Peter Siddle bowled his heart out for four wickets, Ryan Harris was superb and Mitchell Starc claimed key scalps. Lyon toiled away, and was better than his figures suggest. He will be key in the fourth innings. Australia will have half an hour to bat before lunch. Not sure they'll be blocking.

137.4;?;Siddle to Prior, no run gets forward and plays this into the covers;

135.1;?;Siddle to Prior, no run good length outside off, defended to the covers;

Still three men around the bat
 Innings Start
5.40pm: Play has been called off for the day, so we'll be back tomorrow for a certain Australia declaration and, hopefully, an intriguing chase. Rain is predicted again, however, so we'll just have to pitch up in the morning and see what we see. As they say in Manchester, you're all right, duck. You can read Dan Brettig's report here - thanks for your comments, Gnasher and I will join you for more lolz and bantz tomorrow.
5.35pm: Sounds like we're heading for an abandonment at Old Trafford, where there is now standing water on the outfield. Those looking for a good news story, however, should head over to the county blog, where Derbyshire have secured their first win in this season's Division One, beating title-challenging Sussex by nine wickets, to boot.
5.20pm: Not looking good, folks... The forecast for Monday, by the way, suggests persistent showers throughout the day. Though that might be enough to persuade some to invest in the sunblock futures market.
"I thought at the start of the series that Australia definitely have it in them to win at least a couple of Tests," muses HGB. "England are a better team definitely but in the mental make-up, they have a long way to go...Things would have been different had Aus won that close 1st Test."
Andy M is not the first person to disagree with me, he'll not be the last: "That'd be the fragile England team that always gets bowled out for under 200 when they begin an innings 30-3? Oh wait... this is an old, dated stereotype that goes back to the Atherton years. It's their fans that are fragile, not the team!"
"Where's Kevin Rudd?" chirps Tom Price. "Surely it's time to whinge to the ICC about the umpires taking the teams off."
5.05pm: This is a real shame, because the match had shaped up thus far into a mini-classic. Australia have finally stood up to England and hinted at how close this series might have been... For all their skills, this is a fragile England team, prone to flinching in the face of a stiff challenge.
"@Dominique - Australia AREN'T that good," says Dylan T. "But they'd at least like a chance to show that they can match England, which they have more than done so far in this match."
Here's Robbie Leslie: "Aus should have declared 250 ahead (maybe even 220). The weather forecast is bad - the opportunity to bowl Eng out is this evening. Better to risk losing the match in pursuit of the win than wind up with a weather-caused draw."
"I'm currently reading War of The Worlds by HG Wells." Is that the one where the umpires get zapped, Mark Long?
5.01pm: No sooner typed than done - now the rain has arrived. At least we can stop talking about the light, eh? On come the covers, as Australia's hopes of winning this Test and staying in the series begin to gurgle down the spout.
5pm: It looks like it may actually have got darker out there... Rain is still being forecast for this evening, too. So, anyone read any good books recently?
"If umpires are fine with spin being bowled (as they have asked Cook), I would expect Clarke to make a declaration right now and start the match with Lyon, Warner and Smith bowling the overs." Interesting suggestion, Murali, but everyone seems to agree that, having gone off, they can't now go back on again until the umpires decide, regardless of whether Australia want to declare.
Dominique, meanwhile, decides to rub it in: "If whinging Pom is an apt term, then it's one that has been coined by the undoubted world champions in this field. Everything from umpires to DRS and now the weather is apparently conspiring against the Aussies. Maybe they're just not that good."
4.50pm: The umpires are just explaining the situation, Tony Hill suggesting they couldn't pick the ball up very well from square leg. They then asked Alastair Cook if he wanted to bowl spin from both ends, which, unsurprisingly, he declined. Erasmus says that Clarke was asking why the decision had been made so suddenly, but they had been discussing the light since the start of the over.
"The umpiring in this match, and maybe even series, is bordering on a farce," says John. "How is that light dangerous with the lights on. Should we abandon day/night cricket now?" You need to remember that limited-overs cricket is played with a white ball, rather than red, for the reason it's easier to see under lights. But, still, it's not a satisfactory situation.
Rob Noah: "...but its ALWAYS dark in England.. what gives?" Yes, that's why all the dragons and hobbits like living here.
And here's Javed Mohamed: "The only people inconvenienced by the light seems to be the umpires... but then again, during this series they cant even make the correct decisions in broad daylight... or with hotspot technology... or multiple camera angles! So I really shouldn't be surprised."
4.40pm: The umpires remain out in the middle, monitoring the light. Unless it brightens up again, this slightly ludicrous situation will pertain. I can't tell you what the visibility is like at the ground but, generally, unless it's raining or the horizon looks like Mordor, no one likes to see a Test stopped for bad light.
"When there are lights on at the ground, there should never be a reason to stop for 'bad light'. Isn't that the whole point of having lights in the first place?!" It is certainly to enhance the conditions, Ryan, though I think it can create a sort of twilight effect that doesn't help players to see the red ball.
Here's JimDavis: "So what prompted the umpires to think things were dangerous? Even the new batsman was able to see he ball clearly." No one had seemed too inconvenienced, that's for certain.
Dan is just plum peeved: "It seems like everything and everyone are stacked against Australia having a fair go in this series. Do we add the time lost onto tomorrow - no. Precious runs/overs lost for nought. The umpires couldn't see even in good light!"
4.30pm: This is a bit rum, though you have to sympathise with the umpires. Here's the relevant passage from the ICC's playing conditions: "If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light are so bad that there is obvious and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player or umpire, so that it would be unreasonable or dangerous for play to take place, then they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to commence or to restart. The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one for the umpires alone to make."
Once upon a time, the batsmen would have been offered the light but that has changed. England, of course, will be squinting from the balcony for everything they are worth - Australia are 331 ahead, which may already be enough, but sand is beginning to drain out of the egg timer.
4.25pm: It's getting a little gloomy out there... the umpires are having a chat about the light. They've decided it has got too dark, though Michael Clarke is distinctly unhappy. He's having an animated discussion with Marais Erasmus, as England slink quickly off the field. The lights are on at the ground but the umpires have decided it is unsafe to continue... Oh dear me. Australia are going to be bitterly upset at this turn of events. To confirm: Play has been suspended for bad light

"Regardless of the result, I am loving the fightback and attitude the Aussies are showing in this Test," happy-claps Ganesh K. "Scoring at 4.8 runs an over shows their strong intent to go all out for a win."
 Innings Start
That's your lot for the third Test then. Three down, two to go (until November that is!) All the best reaction and analysis coming up here on ESPNcricinfo so stick around as the day goes on and our correspondents file their stuff from Old Trafford. But a bit of a soggy end to proceedings here, here's hoping for the good weather to return in the North East at the end of the week. 10.15am BST we'll be online on Friday for full coverage of the fourth Test, see you then. But from Monty, Gnasher myself and our colleagues in India too, it's goodbye for now...

Presentation coming up, live from the Old Trafford pavilion dining room. Investec medallions are being presented to all and sundry with light applause echoing around the room.

Here's Alsstair Cook: "It's a slightly strange feeling today but for the lads to retain the Ashes after 14 days is great, We were behind the eight ball here, got a bit of luck with the weather but we fought well. Here it was a good toss to win but fair play Australia they put us under a lot of pressure. But we responded well with the bat. The weather hasn't been ideal today. This hasn't got the atmosphere of Melbourne or The Oval but it's a great feeling in the dressing room.

"It was a really good Test wicket, there was a bit in there today. KP batted really well, it was a perfectly timed innings as well. It's slightly stressful with back to back matches but its certainly a challenge. Your always under pressure as a captain."

Michael Clarke is Man of the Match and says: "I tried not the open the curtains this morning. I certainly don't won't to take anything away from England, they deserve to be 2-0 up in this series but in the UK there's always a chance of some rain. It's important we concentrate on the next two Test and leave two-all. We've seen some great signs from the guys here. It's nice to make runs but it's irrelevant, I'd rather get a duck and win the Test. You can feel great and get no runs. Here I had a bit of luck along the way but it's important I make runs in the next two Tests. It's never really mattered to me where I bat. I'll bat wherever I'm needed for the team.

"I think the selectors have done a great job in this series, five Tests are a lot for fast bowlers. Today's rain might help Ryan Harris. When he's on the park he's such an amazing bowler. We'll try and get him back on the park for Friday. The atmosphere won't affect David, if anything the stick will help him. He's a strong character."

England have problems with their batting. Ian Bell has been the only consistent runscorer. Jonathan Trott looked very out of touch here and they will be hoping that's only a one off; he played fluently at Trent Bridge and Lord's. Alastair Cook hasn't been able to on to a big score and his new partnership with Joe Root is yet to really settle. They will be relieved Kevin Pietersen found some runs here. It would help them all-around if they cut out the strangles down the leg side, several of them in the series and what's the saying, one is unlucky, more than once is careless. Questions remain over Jonny Bairstow's capability to play a long innings and Matt Prior's form too. They can be run through this England line up. One complete failure - as Australia have shown - costs Test matches.

The next Test is just four days away and everyone will travel up to Durham for the fourth Test starting on Friday. Australia can take momentum up north, they have a great chance from here to fire a few shots across the bows of their doubters, who, admittedly had plenty of evidence for their case after the first two matches but here Australia proved their stomach for the fight. But what will their side be? Will Ryan Harris be fit? Or will Jackson Bird come in. Is there a way to solidify their batting which is still quite brittle at the top? It was, after all, Clarke the dependable that made most of their runs here.

So there we have it, Ashes done and dusted. Australia fought back with a vengeance here at Old Trafford but they were drinking in the last chance saloon and failure to force the win has ended this series as a contest. There were much better here though, controlling the entire match from ball one. They made a huge total, Michael Clarke led from the front with a brilliant hundred and their bowlers, with runs to play with, put England's slightly misfiring batting line up under great pressure. Australia have plenty to take into the final two matches and still harbour ambitions to draw this series. England have questions to answer.

4,40pm So much for the 5pm inspection, play has been abandoned, the match is drawn and England retain the Ashes! The players appear on the balcony to take the applause from the spectators left in the ground as the good news for the hosts appears on the big screen. England have secured the series after just three matches for only the second time in history, the previous occasion being 1928-29.

OptaJim ?@OptaJim ... "13.5 - R. Harris (13.5% of balls bowled) has induced the highest percentage of play and misses in this #Ashes series. Channel."

Andy Zaltzman ?@ZaltzCricket ... "Australia have retained the Ashes with a draw on 11 occasions. six times in England - four of those at Old Trafford. #engvaus"

4.35pm It's bucketing down lads, this is going to be all over pretty soon I reckon. The umpires are out with brollies up having a look. There are a lot of puddles on the outfield and the covers. Inspection at 5pm we're being told, that could be the moment.

Mike Brewer: "This is a blow, it looks like England just wont have enough time to knock off these runs and keep the five-nil alive"

4.15pm It's now the evening session by the way, so we're losing overs and we're probably down to something like 40 left in the day perhaps? No sign yet of any improvement in the weather.

Damien Martyn ?@dmartyn30 ... "I'm sorry folks I feel it's all over here .. Rain set in dark clouds light not great ! #Ashes #shame"

3.40pm It's now tea. This was scheduled for 4.10pm because of the delays but has been brought forward to allow the evening session to begin at 4pm. We now stop losing overs for 20 minutes which is some solace to Australia. No break in the weather though.

3.25pm Think this tells you all you need to know..."Cricket Australia ?@CricketAus ... Not much to report from Old Trafford. The rain continues to fall. #Ashes #ReturnTheUrn" I think that hastag has got about three hours left of use!

Gareth: "Everyone's a captain in hindsight. What if Clarke declared and the rain stayed away? England would have won the Test and Clarke would have been a laughing stock. He captained well with the facts he had." I don't think anyone would rile Clarke if Australia lost with a generous declaration. They have to win the keep the series alive, it doesn't really matter if they lose.

3pm Rain still falling and no immediate prospects of play. Ben: "For me, all this simply underlines a key question - why didn't Clarke declare earlier? If he had declared at Tea yesterday, Australia would have been 290 ahead, they wouldn't have lost time to the light (because he would have been able to bowl two spinners - as the Umps requested) and England would have had a carrot to chase. Instead, he batted on (even when Starc fell!), gave England no incentive whatsoever to go for the win."

Phil Coates: "What does Cooky say to Clarke when the match is called off and we have retained the Ashes? Bad luck? You batted an hour too long?" How about, pity you didn't turn up in the first two games?

Siddarthan: "The Chennai Test was my first at the stadium. Ganguly was actually happy the fifth day was washed out. He didn't want to chase 232 with Warnie bowling into the rough."

Rishabh: "What goes around does come back around. Remember the Chennai Test in 2004?" Raining again, covers back on. Showers forecast for the rest of the afternoon too...

2.35pm The covers are being dragged back and there's going to be an inspection at 2.45pm, providing we have no more rain of course!

The glass-half-full Aussie...Adrian: "I reckon the rain could play into Aussie hands and make the conditions worse for batting when they finally go back on." It's a theory...

2.25pm Umpires are coming out to have a look, not exactly sure it's stopped raining completely. They're having a chat to the groundsman.

Nick: "To Craig, who likes England being 30 for 3: just a reminder that we were 20-odd and 30-odd for 3 at Lord's and still won by over 300. And for all DRS detractors: you can't say it hasn't evened out now! What goes around comes around... fair play to Oz, though; they've shown some bottle and battle this time round..."

2.15pm We used up the half-hour grace period at the start of the day so now we're losing overs. It was down to 93 in the day when they came back after lunch and that's now being whittled down with every three-and-a-half minutes we lose.

Craig: "I love being an England fan, never boring. I love it almost as much as England love being 30-odd for 3." They've been there a few times in recent months, the top order batting has been very shaky indeed.

2.05pm Clarke having a word with Bell but he deserves some treatment here. And now it's raining pretty hard so they're going off. And from where the weather is coming from it's very dark. All the sheets are coming on...
