Superb comeback by Pakistan after being smashed around by Watson, who by the way reckoned that there was some movement if the bowlers bowled full, and also said the Pakistan bowlers bowled too short to him. By which account, Australia had reached 0 for 80 in 13 overs, but led by their spinners, Pakistan found their way right back. See you in about half an hour with the chase.

1424 Pakistan make their way out to a huge cheer from the Sydney crowd. Lots of emails about Mohammad Asif's exclusion - surely he is injured and not dropped. We don't know what injury yet. Mohammad Aamer has marked his run, Shane Watson his guard. Here we go.
1405 Mohammad Yousuf has won the toss and put Australia in on a day that an odd shower is expected in Sydney. Australia go in with the same XI that took a 1-0 lead in Brisbane. Pakistan, yet to win a thing on the tour, bring in Umar Gul for Mohammad Asif. Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the second ODI between Australia and Pakistan, we are expecting play to begin at 1425. This is Sidharth Monga, your commentator, and Sanjay Murari will be scoring the game.
 Innings Start
So a superb performance by Australia to a 2-0 lead. While Pakistan made their way back from the Watson storm at the top of the Aussie innings, there was no way back after Bollinger and Siddle blew them away with their pace and bounce. It was indeed a joy to watch them bowl consistently in the high 140s - Siddle hit 150.5 ks too, and getting both disconcerting movement and bounce. Long way back for Pakistan in this series. It was fun calling this game, it's Sidharth Monga here saying good bye. We will be there to bring you the next game - on Australia Day. Okay bye.
