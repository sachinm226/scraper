That was thrilling stuff. Hafeez and Jamshed provided the base before Kamran Akmal provided the late fireworks. Australia's bowling was not at its best, too many full tosses and deliveries down the leg side, the fielding also wasn't at it's best though Dan Christian was at his best in the field. This match may be forgotten soon, but that catch will be remembered for years.
Surya: "That catch was worth two wickets!!! It made my week, after a mixed time of it at work."
Deemi Zafar: "@Anirudh is spot-on with the size of grounds these days. Too much batsman-friendly conditions make for an uneven contest - the laws inclusive."
Dan is staying up in Australia: "A very good score from Pakistan - and the Aussies need to play spin? Can we redeem ourselves?"
19.6;1;Christian to Abdul Razzaq, 1 run short of length, Razzaq went for an almighty heave, off the bottom of the bat, rolls down the track for a single, so Pakistan end on 151, looks a decent score that;
19.5;1;Christian to Kamran, 1 run slower bouncer down the leg side, fine leg was in the circle and Kamran will be disappointed at missing out, he just needed to place it past that fielder to get four, he can't beat that fielder though, Pakistan have reached 150;
19.4;1;Christian to Abdul Razzaq, 1 run short from Christian, batsman goes for the pull, top-edges it and it is in the air for a long time, lands short of long-on;
19.3;1;Christian to Kamran, 1 run a full toss is muscled towards long-on for a single;
19.2;4;Christian to Kamran, FOUR runs slower ball outside off, that is sliced away by Kamran, who threw his bat at that, not sure it was where he intended to hit it but Kamran won't mind;
19.1;W;Christian to Umar Akmal, OUT starts the over with wicket, slapped right to deep midwicket and Umar Akmal has to go, a slower delivery, length, that is right off the middle of the bat, but that isn't good enough to clear the rope;Umar Akmal c White b Christian 13 (23m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 108.33;
18.6;1;Cummins to Umar Akmal, 1 run slower short of length ball outside off, guided to third man for a single;

18.4;1;Cummins to Kamran, 1 run slapped towards deep midwicket for a single;
18.3;1;Cummins to Umar Akmal, 1 run short and wide, looks to uppercut that to third man, edged through on the bounce to the keeper, a run out chance of Wade could get the direct hit, the Akmal brothers aren't the best runners in cricket;
18.2;?;Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run premeditated there, looking to glance that towards fine leg after moving across the stumps, too far outside off to pull that off;
18.1;1;Cummins to Kamran, 1 run short of length and outside off, flays it towards third man, drops short of the fielder;
17.6;1;Hogg to Kamran, 1 run more outstanding fielding from Christian, that was powerfully slammed towards the midwicket boundary, that looked a dead-cert boundary till Christian came in, he flung himself to his left and was in the air as he palmed the ball away from the rope, that was travelling fast, but not fast enough to beat Christian, the crowd gasps in awe as they see the replay on the giantscreen;
17.5;4;Hogg to Kamran, FOUR runs power! skips away from leg stump and bludgeons that low full toss over cover, no chance for sweeper cover to stop that bullet;
17.4;1;Hogg to Umar Akmal, 1 run length ball on the stumps, driven towards long-off for one more;
17.3;1;Hogg to Kamran, 1 run flighted and full, just outside off, driven towards long-off;
17.2;?;Hogg to Kamran, no run well outside off, Kamran was looking for the reverse-sweep, bottom-edges it towards the keeper;
17.1;2;Hogg to Kamran, 2 runs that was outside leg stump, a top-edge lobbed to the vacant midwicket region, he was looking to sweep that squarer;

16.5;4;Watson to Kamran, FOUR runs amateurish this, a high full toss from Watson, slammed towards midwicket for four;

16.3;2;Watson to Umar Akmal, 2 runs length ball just outside off, down the ground and that is carved towards sweeper cover, pushes for the second;
16.2;1;Watson to Kamran, 1 run a slower ball and that is slammed towards long-on, Warner is ridiculously quick, he is across in a flash to cut it off;
16.1;4;Watson to Kamran, FOUR runs a full toss, awful bowling that, it is hammered to the midwicket boundary, came down the track and gave it his all;

15.5;?;Hogg to Kamran, no run a touch short from Hogg, Kamran reverse-sweeps towards short third man, Umar was charging for the single, sent back by Kamran, nervous moment there for Umar;
15.4;4;Hogg to Kamran, FOUR runs wonderfully done by Kamran, a full toss on the pads, deftly sends it past Dan Christian at fine leg, Christian chases and puts in a full-length dive though he had no chance of stopping that;
15.3;1lb;Hogg to Umar Akmal, 1 leg bye on the pads, looks to glance it but it is off the pads towards short fine leg;

15.1;1;Hogg to Kamran, 1 run a touch short on leg stump, reverse swept by Kamran;

14.1;W;Watson to Hafeez, OUT this time Australia take the catch, David Warner at long-on,Hafeez plays an ugly slog, the boundaries are massive here, there isn't enough on that to clear the rope, Warner was waiting, takes a good low catch, Watson will be relieved his drop in the previous over didn't cost him team that much;Mohammad Hafeez c Warner b Watson 45 (73m 42b 6x4 0x6) SR: 107.14;

13.3;1;Starc to Hafeez, 1 run dropped by Watson at short cover, Hafeez scoops a low full ball towards Watson, who dives to his right and gets his hands on the ball but can't latch on it, no luck for Starc this over;
13.2;1;Starc to Kamran, 1 run Kamran could have been out twice on that ball (and thrice this over already), first he is dropped by Starc as he punches that back towards the bowler, to the left of Starc who puts out his hand late, after that the ball is rolling towards mid-off, a run-out chance there at the non-striker's end as Kamran gives up, a direct hit would have sent him on his way;
13.1;?;Starc to Kamran, no run bowled from wide of the crease, angling in towards the stumps, that missed the off stump by a fraction after it beat the bat, Starc can't believe that isn't bowled;
12.6;?;Cummins to Hafeez, no run no footwork at all as he swishes at a ball well outside off, a hopeful look at the umpire to ask whether that was a wide, no movement from the umpire;
12.5;1;Cummins to Kamran, 1 run;
12.4;1;Cummins to Hafeez, 1 run Hafeez pulls a shortish delivery;
12.3;W;Cummins to Jamshed, OUT sensational catch from Dan Christian, even he can't believe it, a massive grin on his face as he gets up after plucking that one-handed blinder, set to be a Youtube classic that, Jamshed scooped that one over mid-off, Christian had to back-pedal, he had plenty of ground to cover, he wasn't going to make it so he puts in a full-length dive and stretches out his left hand, it sticks, and it doesn't pop out as he hits the ground, that could well be the catch of the year;Nasir Jamshed c Christian b Cummins 45 (52m 36b 4x4 1x6) SR: 125;

1.2;W;Starc to Imran Nazir, OUT brilliant delivery from Starc, that one swung one and Nazir was clueless about it, through the bat and pad gap and it crashes into middle stump, what a start to Starc's international T20 career, a duck for Imran Nazir;Imran Nazir b Starc 0 (9m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

0.6;4;Cummins to Hafeez, FOUR runs reaches out for this one and crashes it uppishly past a diving point for the third boundary of the over, it has actually been a pretty good over from Cummins but he has been taken for 12, in what is expected to be a low-scoring game;

8.00pm We're set for the first ball. Imran Nazir and Mohammad Hafeez are in the middle, Cummins, playing his fourth T20, has the ball. A large crowd cheering Pakistan on.
Pete: "Exactly, Kamran... it's not dropping. This is not the most important match in the world, but I hope some of the Australians can tune up a bit better than they did against the class Pakistan outfit last one."
7.50pm Kamran: "You've got to feel for Hilfenhaus, the guy bowled really well in the first match. And dropping Maxwell from the format which is his forte after that match winning (and I strongly believe man of the match deserving) performance in the last ODI is also awfully harsh. Hogg for Doherty is still understandable even though Xavier didn't deserve the ax either." Don't think they have been dropped because of their performances. More of a rotation policy before the World T20.
Paul Cooke takes things seriously, it seems. "If Pakistan do whitewash Australia lets still be realistic, regardless of the rankings, no way are Ireland a better side than Australia in any format of the game.Look at the quality of players in both sides it's not rocket science to see who has the better side and let's not forget Australia did reach the final in the last WorldT20!"
It's almost 2am in Sydney, but Dan Brettig is awake and has just bashed out a toss report. Make his day by reading it here.
James: "Tony from Australia is, of course, right about England clean sweeping Pakistan in the one dayers last winter. Thank you for the reminder!!"
Manu: "rotation policy or not, it makes no sense to leave out Maxwell, the only batsman who looked comfortable against Ajmal in the ODIs."
Stats fanatic Mazher Arshad is back: "Most Man of the Match Awards in international matches since 2011: Mohammad Hafeez (12), Virat Kohli (9), Shahid Afridi (8) and Shane Watson (8). However, half of Hafeez's awards are against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe."
Aussie Phil mails from the UK: "The Aussies have shown consistently that they don't care hugely about this format of the game. World Cups though, are a slightly different matter, so I suspect this match is being used to try some different combinations before the T20 WC."
Awais: "James & Tony, save some fun for later guys. Let this one be Pakistan vs Australia."
7.40pm James: "As an Englishman, I'm really hoping for a Pakistan clean sweep in this series. Seeing Australia ranked below Ireland would just be so funny. Sorry, but that's how it is." Am sure you aren't the only one James.
As always, Cricinfo readers are unhappy with the team changes. Ali Abbas: "The Australian changes are beyond me. Their batting failed them and they changed bowlers. The excuse that they want to give bowlers a chance before T20WC is lame as Daniel and Starc have already bowled a lot in this heat."
Emad likes the look of this Pakistan XI: "I can't understand Pakistan's team composition for the ODI series, especially for the last one where we had only 5 bowlers and only one of them being a pacer.
Now this is a much better composition! 3 pacers and 4 spinners and a batting line-up that can bat well all the way till the number 8 batsman!"
Tony from Australia responds to James: "An Englishman would know all about clean sweeps involving Pakistan..." Hilarious!
Fawad among others questioning Doherty's exclusion: "Its a poor decision not to include Doherty. He would have been more than useful on this surface."
Hugh: "As an Irishman, I'm really hopping for an Australia win today. Much rather have us as the team to knock them below us."
7.30pm Pakistan win the toss and choose to bat. Pakistan have made no changes to the side, that means they still have four spinners in the XI.
George Bailey says he doesn't think the track will change much over the course of the match, and that he'd have batted first as well. Bailey says the changes in the team are to give more of the bowlers a chance before the World Twenty20.
Btw, Bailey turns 30 today, and he wants a win as a birthday present.
7.20pm Greetings, second T20 between Pakistan and Australia coming up. A big crowd is expected at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on this Friday night, possibly the biggest of the series.
Australia's batting imploded two days ago, and they need to pull it together today to stay alive in this series. A bit strange then that they have revamped the bowling for today's game. Changes are: Glenn Maxwell, Xavier Doherty and Ben Hilfenhaus are all dropped. The allrounder Daniel Christian has been included, along with the spinner Brad Hogg and the fast bowler Mitchell Starc. Read Brydon Coverdale's preview to get up to speed about today's game.
The pitch isn't a typical T20 flat track, so the batsmen will need to set their sights on a lower target than usual. The long boundaries in Dubai will also contribute to smaller scores.
The toss is coming up in a couple of minutes. Shahid Afridi won't play today either as he is still injured.
 Innings Start
Australia will bat first in the Superover.
Warner, Watson and Bailey are Australia's chosen batsmen. The Pakistan team has a long discussion over who will bowl. It will be Umar Gul. Ajmal was off the field for the final two overs or so, which I think means he can't bowl now, which explains the long discussion over who to choose.
19.6;W;Abdul Razzaq to Cummins, OUT it's a Superover, it wasn't the best final ball form Razzaq but it was good enough, a full toss on the pads, Cummins was looking to work that to the leg side, a leading edge that ballons towards mid-off, Imran Nazir and Umar Akmal both went for it, Nazir called for it, Umar backed away, Nazir takes it, Cummins wrings his hands in disappointment, this has been some game;Pat Cummins c Imran Nazir b Abdul Razzaq 7 (4m 3b 0x4 1x6) SR: 233.33;
19.5;6;Abdul Razzaq to Cummins, SIX runs oh my! he is nerveless with the bat here as well, a massive hit , a short of length ball heading down leg stump, that is a monster hit from Cukmmins that sends it over the wide long-on boundary, the scores are level, Australia coach Mickey Arthur loves that shot;
19.4;1;Abdul Razzaq to Christian, 1 run short ball heading for the helmet, Christian can only get a single as he pulls it towards midwicket, that put plenty on pressure on young Cummins, who was nerveless on Test debut with the bat;
19.3;1;Abdul Razzaq to Cummins, 1 run a slower full ball on middle and leg, once again it is Arafat who fields after Cummins sweeps to deep square leg;
19.2;1;Abdul Razzaq to Christian, 1 run a full toss is whipped towards midwivcket for a single;
19.1;W;Abdul Razzaq to Bailey, OUT Razzaq strikes first ball, the birthday boy can't finish it, a slower short ball outside off, Bailey goes for the pull, a top edge and that sails towards midwicket, the substitute Arafat is everywhere, he takes the catch, Australia's bowlers will have to do the job with the bat now, you wouldn't believe the noise levels in Dubai;George Bailey c sub (Yasir Arafat) b Abdul Razzaq 42 (46m 27b 4x4 2x6) SR: 155.55;
18.6;?;Umar Gul to Christian, no run length ball outside off, Christian is beaten, there is an appeal for a caught-behind;
18.5;W;Umar Gul to Wade, 1 run, OUT insanity! direct hit from third man, this is certainly not the Pakistan team we all expect, Matthew Wade is gone, brilliance from the substitute fielder Arafat, a yorker from Gul just outside off, squeezed down to third man, Wade wanted the second, but he was well out when that throw crashed into the stumps;Matthew Wade run out (sub [Yasir Arafat]) 6 (15m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
18.4;1;Umar Gul to Bailey, 1 run ooh, another time when the batsman could have been dismissed twice, a shortish ball is hammered back by Bailey, Gul stretches out his right hand but can't hang on to that one, then there's even more disappointment for him as he sees the ball just loop over the stumps at the non-striker's end;
18.3;4;Umar Gul to Bailey, FOUR runs poor from Gul, that was a knee-high full toss from Gul, Bailey sends that past short fine leg for four more, Australia surely ahead now;
18.2;4;Umar Gul to Bailey, FOUR runs Gul looking to hit the base of off stump, an inside-edge, a thick one sends it past short fine leg for four, 16 off 10 needed now, Bailey playing a gem here;
18.1;1;Umar Gul to Wade, 1 run starts with a yorker, driven towards long-off for a single;
17.6;6;Ajmal to Bailey, SIX runs Bailey finishes off Ajmal's spell with a muscular hit for six, superb hit that from the Australian captain, and a much-needed one too, that was too short from Ajmal, a doosra which Bailey read;
17.5;?;Ajmal to Bailey, no run beaten outside off, that one bounces more than Bailey expects and doesn't turn in either;
17.4;1;Ajmal to Wade, 1 run quicker from Ajmal, on middle and off, poked behind point for a single;
17.3;1;Ajmal to Bailey, 1 run goes for the reverse-sweep, gets it towards point to get a single;
17.2;1;Ajmal to Wade, 1 run sliding on towards off stump, slapped towards backward point for a single;
17.1;1;Ajmal to Bailey, 1 run slams the first towards long-on, just a single;

11.4;1;Raza Hasan to Bailey, 1 run could have been another wicket there, Bailey went for the sweep, which seems to be Australia's tactic against spin, that was a top edge which looped in the air but didn't go all the way to deep backward square leg;
11.3;?;Raza Hasan to Bailey, no run spins away sharply, and the birthday boy can't get bat on it;
11.2;W;Raza Hasan to White, OUT a run-out, a direct hit from Umar Akmal, Australia lose one more, pushed that towards backward point and White wanted one, took a few paces down the track, there was no run in that as White belatedly realises, he looks to hasten back, by then Umar Akmal has fired in a throw that catches White short, two wickets in two overs for Pakistan, the crowd is loving it, Pakistan's fielding coach looking pleased as well;Cameron White run out (Umar Akmal) 5 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;

10.5;1;Ajmal to White, 1 run White looking to push that offspinner to the off side, huge lbw appeal, hit him just outside the line though the umpire didn't signal leg-byes, so he thinks there was an inside-edge, there wasn't but the line would have saved White;

9.6;4;Tanvir to Hussey, FOUR runs full and wide, Hussey is an amazing batsman, he could barely reach that one but he still manages to deftly place it wide of the deep square leg fielder to pick up a boundary, 15 off the over, Australia keeping pace, but Ajmal has three to go;

7.2;?;Hafeez to Hussey, no run watchful defence from Hussey;

4.2;1;Ajmal to Warner, 1 run pushed towards mid-on for a single this time;
4.1;?;Ajmal to Warner, no run Warner looks to reverse-sweep, actually the switch hit, he misses and that slides down the leg side (for a right-hander);
3.6;4;Umar Gul to Watson, FOUR runs short from Gul, a terrific pull from Watson, gets plenty of power on it to send it towards the midwicket boundary, Umar Akmal trying to cut that off near the rope but it was too quick for him, even Dan Christian would have had a tough time stopping that;
3.5;?;Umar Gul to Watson, no run back of a length and around off, defended from the crease by Watson;

 Innings Start
Pat Cummins given the responsibility. Umar Akmal and Abdul Razzaq are the batsmen in the middle now. It was Razzaq to Cummins that tied the game, what will Cummins to Razzaq bring?
Praneet: "If ever there were a Utopian world , this would be the utopian cricket match." For those of you asking, Superover runs and wickets aren't added to a player's career stats.
Surya: "Time to amend your half-time commentary that people will forget the match but not the catch. Now folks will say "THAT catch from THAT match"!"
Target for Pakistan is 12 runs. Still waiting to see who will bowl for Australia, and who Pakistan's batsmen are.
0.6;1;Cummins to Umar Akmal, 1 run Pakistan win, they take the serie 2-0, Akmal dabs the final ball of an exhausting match to cover and sneaks the single that seals the win, there was a chance of a run-out there, Akmal could have been short, but Dan Christian, him of the heroic fielding, doesn't collect the ball cleanly before breaking the stumps, Akmal sets off on a fist-pumping celebration, Cummins is distraught, Bailey consoles some of his team-mates, the crowd is drained after a rollercoaster of a match. Whoah, can't ask for more from a T20. Belal bin Suleman: "I love you Cricket... Muaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah." And Rob Noah: "This is the best T20 game I've ever read." Got to feel for young Pat Cummins, must have thought he has sealed the game with that mammoth six off the penultimate ball, but he couldn't pull it off off the next ball, and he was just short in the SuperOver as well. As Irteza says: "Poor Pat! I am feeling for him. He is such a fine fast bowler." Cricket-India: "why MUST a tied T20 have a super-over decider? isn't a tie the deserving result for two equally matched and equally determined teams??" I'm no fan of Superovers either. Surely the match is exciting enough when the scores are tied. Maryam Siddiqui: "Amazing. Just truly amazing. Hands have semi stopped shaking but heart is still racing. Really must be the most intense match I've seen since Razzaq's century off of 72 deliveries against South Africa a couple years back. Thank you Pakistan, Thank you Australia." Not that the T20 rankings are to be taken seriously, but Australia have now slid to 10th place. Time for the post-match presentation. Man of the Match is Saeed Ajmal. "I had an injury to my shoulder, that's why they gave the Superover to Gul." George Bailey: "Good game of cricket, we had our chances today. Our bowling was good, nice to see our batsmen hit a few out of the middle. We will be ready to go for game three." Mohammad Hafeez: "This is T20, it can bring anything. The boys responded well under pressure. The batters put on the score, 140-plus which is needed here, then Saeed Ajmal and Umar Gul bowled really well." And that's a wrap from this extraordinary game. Thanks for the many, many mails. Seeya on Monday for game three.;
0.6;1w;Cummins to Umar Akmal, 1 wide too short from Cummins, he went for the bouncer but that sails over the batsman's head, scores are level now, Pakistan 11/0;
0.5;1;Cummins to Abdul Razzaq, 1 run Cummins doesn't go for the blockhole, back of a length ball is scooped towards David Hussey at mid-off, he dives forward but can't only collect off the half-volley, Pak 10/0. Target is 12;
0.4;4;Cummins to Abdul Razzaq, FOUR runs Pakistan need three off two now as Razzaq calmly slaps a short ball outside off to the deep backward point boundary, Pakistan 9/0, the crowd loving it, can Cummins find the yorker?;
0.3;1;Cummins to Umar Akmal, 1 run Cummins keeps it short, outside off, Akmal was looking to work that over the keeper, he doesn't connect well and they take the single to the keeper. Over to Razzaq;
0.2;4;Cummins to Umar Akmal, FOUR runs it was short from Cummins, just outside off, that is hammered back past the bowler for four, Pakistan 4/0;
0.1;?;Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run slower wide one, Akmal goes for a wild thrash after charging down, misses it by a mile;
0.6;2;Umar Gul to Bailey, 2 runs a low full toss heading for leg stump, once again some sharp fielding from Pakistan, only two off the final ball, Aus finish on 11, that is a pretty good effort from Gul;
0.5;W;Umar Gul to Warner, OUT a short ball from Gul and that is top-edged towards long-off, so a priceless dot ball for Pakistan, Aus 9/0;David Warner c Umar Akmal b Umar Gul 0 (5b 1x4 0x6);
0.5;1w;Umar Gul to Warner, 1 wide Gul had been spot on so far, but that is wide down the leg side, free run for Australia, if Warner had got some bat on that could have been hit for four, Aus 9/0;
0.4;4;Umar Gul to Warner, FOUR runs Warner looks to throw Gul off his length by shimmying down the track, gets a bit of bat and he glances that full on down to fine leg, Aus 8/0;
0.3;1;Umar Gul to Watson, 1 run Gul keeps it full, Watson can't get under that one, punched towards mid-on, Aus 4/0 after three balls;
0.2;2;Umar Gul to Watson, 2 runs a low full toss, whipped away towards deep midwicket where it is that man again, Yasir Arafat, keeps Australia to two;
0.1;1;Umar Gul to Warner, 1 run a yorker outside off, terrific ball, a single towards mid-off;

Australia will bat first in the Superover.
Warner, Watson and Bailey are Australia's chosen batsmen. The Pakistan team has a long discussion over who will bowl. It will be Umar Gul. Ajmal was off the field for the final two overs or so, which I think means he can't bowl now, which explains the long discussion over who to choose.
