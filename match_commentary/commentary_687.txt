5.1;W;McGrath to Taylor, OUT McGrath gets a wicket off his first ball. Wicket no 66 for him in World cups. Banged in short, Taylor is on the front foot, goes for a pull from there and hits straight to midwicket. McGrath is obviously happy. Looks at the batsman, claps before running away towards the catcher.;Ross Taylor c Hussey b McGrath 3 (8m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
4.6;3;Bracken to Taylor, 3 runs fuller, pushed across Taylor who jumps at it, slices it through point. Clarke gives the chase, pulls it back.;

3.5;?;Tait to Taylor, no run Fires in a 151 k bouncer, ducked under;
3.4;?;Tait to Taylor, no run fuller, on the middle and leg stump line, Taylor tries to flick it, loses balance in the process, falls over a touch and inside-edges it on to the pad. Can we play straight when we are new to the crease please?!;
3.3;W;Tait to Fleming, OUT gets him with a bouncer. Fleming is not happy. Banged in short, on the middle and off, Fleming tries to pull off the front foot, the ball bounces more than he anticipated, and thudded into his left arm before bobbing away to Ponting at second slip. They go up in appeal and Aleem Dar raises the fatal finger. No wonder Fleming was not happy, it beat the bat and went off the arm.;Stephen Fleming c Ponting b Tait 12 (18m 9b 1x4 1x6) SR: 133.33;
3.2;4;Tait to Fleming, FOUR runs edged past second slip. Full in length, slanting away from Fleming who shuffled across, had a flash and it flew past Ponting. It would have gone straight to third slip. Tait is not amused. Bouncer coming up, surely.;
3.1;1;Tait to Fulton, 1 run banged in short, at the body, on middle and leg, Fulton is caught in a tangle but he adjusts to swipe it away, pulls it away with a bit of top edge to fine leg;

2.2;?;Bracken to Fleming, no run;
2.1;1;Bracken to Fulton, 1 run On the middle and leg, fullish, Fleming leans across, falls over a touch, flicks to square-leg;

As you would have noticed, I goofed up. This is McGrath's 66th wicket in World cup. not in this one. Now that would be a carnage. So please hold your mails.
