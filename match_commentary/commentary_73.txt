David Warner: "I felt a little bit bogged down there and again frustrated. I managed to hang in there and build a good partnership with Finchy and Uzi as well. When you're deep into your innings you're a bit fatigued. I was just trying to give our fast bowlers as many runs as possible to come out and start well. We're just trying to make up for that year. Coming out here I hit a lot of fielders. I did it last game as well. I think the wicket was a tad on the slower side. One bowler who bowls over 140kph, and Rubel hit good lengths. We capitalised at the back end. We need to come out and bowl well, try and take some wickets in the powerplay and then build some pressure."
Australia might have left 20 out there despite superb innings from Khawaja and Finch as well. Maxwell's cameo could have been anything but a mix up and then Khawaja's dismissal stalled their innings late.
Hemant will be back shortly to take you through the chase. The break is shorter than usual due to the rain delay.

 Innings Start
That's all from our side, folks. Thanks for joining us. See you tomorrow.
You can watch our expert discuss the game on our Match Day Live show.

Aaron Finch: [On having butterflies] Everytime the team gets some partnership, yes. A couple of changes were forced, when you lose your allrounder. So just toying with ideas but also relying on the surface. If it's a dry wicket, we might have two spinners. [On fielding] Very sloppy, early on it was a bit slippery but no excuses. Not thinking about the semi-finals as of now. [On his form] The wickets have been pretty nice to bat on.
Mashrafe Mortaza: I think we conceded 40-50 runs more, otherwise it could have been different. Mushy, Shakib, Tamim batted very well. Riyad was very good towards the end. That's the best ODI side we ever had. To be honest, we were positive from the first ball. After Soumya got out, Tamim and Shakib kept going but 381 was too much to get.
Qasim: "Great game by Bangladesh today. So happy to see them play this well. But, it just worries me a bit that what would happen after their fab5 retire? Their over dependence on Shakib, Mushfiq, Tamim, Mahmudullah and Mashrafe seriously worries me. It's about time the others step up in these big games. It's good for the game that more teams are playing top level cricket now."
David Warner is the Man of the Match. "It's a great achievement [equalling Adam Gilchrist's hundred tally], but it's more about two points and moving forward," he says. "You have to respect the new ball. You have to adapt to the conditions. It (the wicket) was a tad slow. But it was a grind for the bowlers, wasn't easy to get wickets."
6.55pm A 48-run win in the end for Australia to see them to the top of the points table with ten points. But spare a thought for Bangladesh who never gave up despite a herculean task in front of them and posted their highest-ever ODI total. They still have a chance to make to the semi-finals. But star of the game was, undoubtedly, David Warner, who posted 166 off 147 balls on a sluggish track. He has now overtaken Shakib Al Hasan as the leading run-scorer of the tournament.
