Bond led New Zealand's outstanding effort in the field. He now has 33 wickets in 10 ODIs at a staggering 13.12 apiece against them. Australia never lost a clutch of wickets together but they were just unable to score. The target of 149 may seem small on paper but conditions are not easy for batting and Australia will fight tooth and nail. Join me in about 35 minutes (18.15 local time) for the second innings.

Hello everybody and welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the first of three matches of the Chappell-Hadlee series between New Zealand and Australia. Today's game is a day-night affair at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington. I'm George Binoy and I'll be hammering away at my keyboard to bring you all the action as it unfolds.
Toss: New Zealand have won the toss and will bowl.
Australia 1 Matthew Hayden, 2 Phil Jaques, 3 Brad Haddin (wk), 4 Brad Hodge, 5 Michael Hussey (capt), 6 Cameron White, 7 Shane Watson, 8 Brad Hogg, 9 Nathan Bracken, 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Glenn McGrath.
New Zealand 1 Stephen Fleming (capt), 2 Lou Vincent, 3 Ross Taylor, 4 Scott Styris, 5 Craig McMillan, 6 Jacob Oram, 7 Brendon McCullum (wk), 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 Shane Bond, 10 Mark Gillespie, 11 Daryl Tuffey.
With less then a month to go before cricket's biggest carnival kicks off in the West Indies, the two teams have taken a contrasting approach to this series. New Zealand are fielding their full-strength squad - the men who will try to bring home the World Cup, while Australia have rested Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist, their regular captain and vice-captain. They also have a few injury worries with Brett Lee returning home due to an ankle injury and Michael Clarke suffering from a sore hip.
The versatile Michael Hussey will fill Ponting's boots and will lead a squad that includes the new faces of Adam Voges, the Western Australian middle-order batsman, and Brad Haddin. Haddin, in particular, has a lot to play for with Gilchrist missing the first part of the World Cup to be with his family for the birth of his third child. If Haddin were to fire on all the cylinders he's got, who knows what could happen ... Phil Jaques, who smacked 94 on debut during last year's VB Series and then vanished, has been called up as cover for Clarke.
New Zealand, whose CB Series campaign fell to pieces after a promising start, will attempt to fine-tune their World Cup combinations. They've recalled Craig McMillan who was dropped for the final stages of the tri-series in Australia and Daryl Tuffey, remember him, returns to bolster the pace-attack after spending close to two years in the wilderness.
The weather in Wellington isn't the best - grey skies and cold, windy weather should make it an uncomfortable afternoon for both sides. There was some rain earlier in the day but the weather has improved.
Aleen Dar and Billy Bowden will be making the vital decisions today. New Zealand have taken the field and Australia's openers are Matthew Hayden and Phil Jaques, in the absence of Gilchrist. Daryl Tuffey has the new ball and will charge in from over the wicket with two slips in place.
 Innings Start
It's been 22 years since New Zealand last had an opening-stand of over hundred against Australia. Australia have been defeated by ten wickets for the first time in ODI history today. They were missing five key players - Ponting, Gilchrist, Clarke, Lee and Symonds - but they have been humiliated.
The New Zealand bowlers - Shane Bond in particular - made a difficult pitch look unplayable. The Australian batsmen were very subdued and didn't build any momentum. Lou Vincent and Stephen Fleming batted aggressively from the start of the chase and that made a lot of difference.
Here's another interesting fact, if Australia go on to lose the Chappell-Hadlee series, South Africa will move ahead of them as the No 1 ranked team on ODIs. It will be the first time Australia have been dethroned since the ratings were introduced by the ICC in 2002.
Shane Bond is the obvious choice for the Man of the Match. He bowled superbly right through and returned figures of 5 for 23. I've enjoyed bringing today's game to you. Keep a watch on Cricinfo for updates on Oram's finger. Thank you for all your emails and do join us on Sunday for the second ODI at Auckland. This is George Binoy signing off. Cheers!
