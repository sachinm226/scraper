South Africa bowl Australia out for 222 in 48 overs. Real bad from Australia, who failed to see out their alloted overs. South Africa need 223 to win the series. It was a disciplined effort from them. We will be back in a while for the second innings. You could spend the break checking out Cricinfo's

"The predominantly right handed Australian middle order (Hussey, Haddin, White and Hopes, with Clarke to return) are unlikely to get much respite from their difficulties with quality spin any time soon," says Stephen Rendall. "They have NZ in a five match series starting in February and, while Australia will find the going easier against NZ, they will have to find a way to deal with Vettori who bowls extremely well to right handed batsmen looking to work him around in the middle overs - look for lbw decisions with the arm ball sliding in and failing to turn."

Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the fourth ODI at Adelaide.
Toss: Australia have won the toss and there are no surprises, they will be batting. Cameron White comes back for Nathan Hauritz, and Ben Hilfenhaus replaces Nathan Bracken. For South Africa, the injured Mark Boucher is replaced by Morne Morkel. AB de Villiers will keep wickets.
Just to remind you, South Africa lead the five-match series 2-1. A win here will seal the deal for them.
Here come the teams. It looks to be pretty hot out there. The pitch looks a belter. A good crowd gathered. Dale Steyn will take up the attack. There are runs in this pitch. Shaun Marsh faces up. Two slips in place.
 Innings Start
Well then, South Africa are enjoying the moment. They have taken an unassailable 3-1 lead with one game to go. AB and Amla whoop it up and grab stumps for souvenirs. Hats off to South Africa. The Adelaide Oval cheers them on.
How about a quick recap? Ponting won the toss on a good batting deck and made first use. South Africa's bowlers performed admirably in the stifling heat and struck back around Ponting's fifty. The captain, Botha, was frugal with the ball and snapped up Hussey and Haddin. Australia were in desperate need of a rear-guard action, but it never came. Ntini and Steyn chipped away and Australia were bowled out in 48 overs.
After chasing down 270 in Sydney last week, 223 didn't prove that hard for South Africa, particularly with a number of the batsmen in form. Gibbs had a bit of fun what with the fielding restrictions and all, and after he fell Kallis went. Amla and AB were unclustered and both played steady innings, later accelerating when victory was in sight.
"I've been really happy with my bowing in the last few games," says Botha. "I am very proud of the guys. We've been brilliant. We would like to finish the tour with another win."
AB is the Man of the Match for his unbeaten 82 from 85 balls. He also kept wicket, remember. "Things just fell together," he says. "Its been an unbelievable few months. Its all come true for us. A Test win and an ODI win. Its been hard work though."
So thats it, South Africa have won the Tests and the ODIs. A great tour for them indeed. Congratulations.
Do come back and join us for the fifth and final game, which is on January 30 in Perth.
Hope you've enjoyed the coverage. Thanks for your time. Be well!
