Data
South Africa have done superbly to reach 317, considering their sedate start and some good bowling by the Australians early on. The innings was set up by the 136-run third-wicket stand between Gibbs and de Villiers. After both fell, Boucher and Duminy, after a shaky start in the last ten overs, did incredibly well at the death to help their team reach a formidable score. Australia have their task cut out, made all the more difficult by the fact that they are fighting to save the series. Join us in about 30 minutes for their run-chase.

 Innings Start
Three successive wins have handed South Africa the series here. Australia were in the hunt with the kind of start they got from Clarke and Haddin, who added 129. But three wickets in fairly quick succession, all to spinners turned the tide in favour of South Africa. van der Merwe was the star for them with the ball, taking three wickets 3 for 46, including the half-centurion Clarke and Michael Hussey. Ponting started off slowly but got into his groove a little too late with five wickets down. He took four boundaries off an over from Steyn in the third powerplay but fell off the final ball, proving decisive in the outcome. Hopes tried to resist, but Steyn came back well to clean up the tail and finish with 4 for 44.
Ponting: "It (the score) was too many in the end. We let them off in the middle and towards the end of their innings. Gibbs played a sensational knock, and despite the movement early on, we couldn't do well enough. We are professional cricketers and we try to do our best each time we play. We weren't able to do well this time, and the South Africans outplayed us in the last three games."
Herschelle Gibbs is the Man of the Match for his 110.
Gibbs: "It's a beautiful ground to play and a beautiful crowd as well. It was a matter of getting through the new ball, and the guys prepared a really good wicket. It was all about getting partnerships up front and the guys finished up very well in the end. It was nice to get some runs today and finish off what has been a really peaceful easter weekend."
Smith: "Another very good day for us, and the batsmen did a superb job. Gibbs has been getting some starts, but it was good to see him do well today. We were going to bat anyway, but we were hoping for the pitch to slow up. It is a bit unusual for Australia to bowl first in big games. Everyone's contributing with both bat and ball, and we'll look to finish the series on a high note at the Wanderers."
That's all we have from here folks. Thanks for tuning in and sending us all your feedback. We'll see you again for the fifth and final ODI in Johannesburg on April 17. Until then, on behalf of all of us at Cricinfo, it's Siddhartha Talya signing off. Adios!

0.2;1;Steyn to Haddin, 1 run on middle and leg, dabbed into the leg side for a quick single;
0.1;1;Steyn to Clarke, 1 run off the mark straightaway, good length on the off stump, pushed wide of mid-off for a single;
0.1;2w;Steyn to Haddin, 2 wide straying down the leg side, false start, Boucher dives full length to his left and does well to concede just two wides;

Welcome back. Australia have a stiff task ahead of them. However, they have an excellent record on this ground, and they have chased down big totals here before. As Muneer generously reminds us: "Aus has successfully chased 326 against SA on this ground on 6th April 2002. Scorecard is here."
The openers are out in the middle. Steyn will start the proceedings for South Africa, and facing him is Haddin. Two slips in place.
