What an innings by Pollard! West Indies were in a terrible position early on and they were not really scoring runs either. Pollard found some support and constructed useful stands with the lower order to take West Indies to a very respectable 220. A very very uncharacteristic innings by the big man, but exactly what the Windies needed. Australia had things going there way in the first half when Mitchell Johnson ripped through the top order, but they were unable to clean the innings up. We will be back in the chase in about 35 mins.
Reuel: "This is the best inns that i have ever seen Pollard play, brilliant batting by him, certainly his best hundred thus far. happy that i stayed up to watch him bat, well played Polly."
* Apologies for not putting up any comments. There has been a technical snag with that.



Rohit Shankar: "By technical snag you mean that the guy doing the filtering in on leave :)" No Rohit, the time stamps on these comments are all jumbled up. So I get the comments, but they are not showing up in any order.

7.6;W;Johnson to Bravo, OUT caught at second slip! Is anyone missing Starc now? not me.

Toss: West Indies have won the toss and they will bat first. Australia have brought in Adam Voges in place of George Bailey (hamstring injury) and Ben Cutting replaces Mitchell Starc. West Indies have three changes - Johnson Charles, Deonarine and El Tino come in for Gayle, Sarwan and Roach.
paul: "Windies won the toss ay lets see if they can get past 70 today."
Chad: "Shame that WI is batting first. Watson can't get consecutive centuries now."
Patrick: "@ Paul & Chad, Starc is not playing. Windies to get 270+"
Taofiq: "@Chad: If West Indies do get some sort of score over 200, a look at Watson's stats will show that if he really is in good form, he should do well today. Batting first, he averages 34.13 with 2 centuries (including the one a few days ago), and batting second he averages 57.10 with 5 centuries."
Just 10 minutes from the start of the game now. Time to get my cup of tea ready and then we are set to go. Seems like there is not much interest in this match; Tom Moody has just tweeted from a beach.. I hope he regrets missing a thriller..
Dave: "With injuries and sending people to India early, you would think that Hussey (either of them) would get a proper look in. D Huss's 60 in the first game against Sri Lanka was quality and Mr. Cricket, well ... it is in his name isn't it."
Dave-2: "Does not selecting a spin bowler on a dry wicket in Sydney smack of arrogance, or ignorance, Australia?" .. Spinner? But they are playing McKay and Faulkner in, aren't they?



"I'm back," Watson said after scoring a ton that set up Australia's win against West Indies at the Manuka Oval. Watson, who was playing international cricket after sometime, looked like he never left. He drove the ball powerfully and with ease, and the timing of the innings was perfect too. On the other hand, West Indies' big guns haven't really fired. There have been good individual performances, but as a batting and bowling unit, the team has lacked incisiveness. Chris Gayle, who has been lacklustre, is doubtful for this match. Welcome to our coverage of the 4th ODI in Sydney.
 Innings Start
Game over: The total, in the end, was not enough to test the Australian batsmen. Shane Watson was fantastic second game in a row and he got great support from all the other batsmen in the top order. Tino Best was exciting to watch with all that pacy stuff, but other bowlers were hardly a threat. Australia go 4-0 up in the series just like that.
For West Indies, Kieron Pollard, who is also the man of the match, played an amazing innings to prop up the score to 220 but there wasn't much from the others. Mitchell Johnson bowled with fire up front and did most of the damage earlier. There is just one more game to go - in Melbourne - and the home side would hope for a clean sweep.
Thanks for all your comments and feedback and I apologise for the technical issues from our side. We will be back with our coverage for the 5th ODI. It's Devashish Fuloria signing off from here, ciao ciao.
