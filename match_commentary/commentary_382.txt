Data
1.05 pm Australia have been restricted to 204 for 8 on a pitch that is slow and has turn for the spinners. Sunil Narine thrived on the surface, restricting the run flow with Marlon Samuels and Kemar Roach. Dwayne Bravo picked up three wickets. West Indies have not beaten Australia in an ODI since the group stages of the 2006 Champions Trophy. They have a good chance today if they can pace their chase well. We'll be back in about 40 minutes.

7.1;W;Bravo to Watson, OUT this time the umpire's given Watson lbw and Australia have asked for a review. It's quite similar to the appeal in Bravo's first over, which the umpire said was not out and West Indies reviewed unsuccessfully. Watson came half-forward to a delivery that nipped into him off the pitch. He was beaten on the front-foot defence and hit in front. The ball hit the pad in line and it wasn't too high either. That would have hit the top of middle and leg. Watson has to go. Both teams are a review down.;Shane Watson lbw b Bravo 21 (35m 23b 4x4 0x6) SR: 91.3;

3.4;1;Bravo to Warner, 1 run Warner gets squared up as he tries to defend and the thick outside edge goes towards third man;
3.3;?;Bravo to Warner, no run Warner plays back to one that was too full to play back to, he prods and gets beaten as the ball seams across him;
3.2;?;Bravo to Warner, no run another ball kicks off a good length, Warner stays in his crease and defends on the leg side;
3.1;1;Bravo to Watson, 1 run Watson stays back and cuts a short of a length delivery towards third man, that bounced a bit but Watson controlled his shot;
2.6;1;Roach to Watson, 1 run Watson drives straight and Russell runs to his left from mid-on and dives to prevent the boundary;

1.2;4;Bravo to Watson, FOUR runs short and wide outside off, Watson frees those powerful arms and cuts hard over the leaping fielder at point;
1.1;?;Bravo to Watson, no run a confident appeal for lbw first up but the umpire says not out. Darren Sammy has asked for a review. The ball had nipped into the right-hander from a good length just outside off and beat the front-foot drive. Replays are taking a while and when we finally have them they indicate that the impact on the pad was marginally outside off stump. So the decision will stay with the on-field call. That ball was going on to hit off stump. Had the umpire given it out, and Watson reviewed it, it would have stayed out. He's survived by the narrowest of margins.;

b>9.15 am It's sunny but there is some cloud about. Nothing threatening at the moment. The pitch is expected to play slow, so chasing could be tricky. I'm looking forward to see how the Australian batsmen fare against Sunil Narine, the offspinner.
Gareth: "I don't want to sell out my nation, but I'd love to see Russell and Narine have an awesome series. They both play the game with that true West Indian flair, and have bright futures as young players."
Toss, 9.00 am Shane Watson has won the toss and Australia are going to bat.

8.50 am Hello, welcome to ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage of Australia's tour of the West Indies. It kicks off with the first one-day international in Kingstown, St Vincent.
Australia's camp has had to cope with Brad Haddin's sudden return home for personal reasons, though it wouldn't have affected their XI today - since Mathew Wade was going to play.
West Indies have not beaten Australia since the Champions Trophy in 2006 - I was at that game, Jerome Taylor took a hat-trick - so it has been ages.
The toss should have happened, I'll bring you the details of it as soon as I get some myself.
 Innings Start
So Australia win by a comfortable 64 runs after a pretty miserable batting performance from West Indies who gifted most of their wickets. Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo had laid a platform but it disintegrated in the blink of an eye. It raises familiar questions about West Indies' batting stocks and there is plenty of work to do ahead of the second match on Sunday.
Australia, though, will be delighted with the winning start on a tricky surface. The batting wasn't and its best but they mustered a decent total. Early wickets then gave them a lift then Doherty responded superbly from a tough first over that cost 18.
I'll bring you the presentation shortly, and Brydon's match report will be here.
Darren Sammy "We are very disappointed," he starts before the master of understatements. "Losing six wickets for seven runs set us back a little bit."
Then he looks ahead. "Hopefully we can bounce back in the second match. We have two more games here, we have a history of getting better as a series goes on."
George Bailey is the Man of the Match. "We didn't get as many as we would have liked but I thought if Mike Hussey was finding it tough it must have been tough and we just wanted to give the lower order a chance to have swing at the end."
Shane Watson "We knew it was an average score and knew it should be enough if we bowled well. Dwayne Bravo was batting very nicely so we knew we needed a breakthrough but the surface was offering help to the quicks and spinners. Xavier Doherty came back really nicely when he changed ends. All the bowlers were good today."
So that just about wraps things up for today. The second match is on Sunday and we'll see if West Indies can bounce back. But don't forget the third day of New Zealand-South Africa starts shortly and we'll have full coverage on ESPNcricinfo. For now, though, it's goodbye from Andrew McGlashan and George Binoy.
32.2;W;McKay to Sammy, OUT all over, Sammy's late flourish is ended and so is the match. He tries to try over the off side and only picks out cover;Daren Sammy c Christian b McKay 35 (28m 20b 3x4 3x6) SR: 175;
32.1;6;McKay to Sammy, SIX runs he has plenty of power and picks this up from a good length outside off, sending it over the midwicket boundary again;
32.1;1w;McKay to Sammy, 1 wide starts with a slower-ball gone wrong that loops out well wide of off stump;
31.6;?;Lee to Roach, no run strikes Roach with a well-directed short ball. Not very well played as he took his eye off it and takes a blow on the shoulder;
31.5;?;Lee to Roach, no run on off stump, solidly defended to the covers...Roach has shown batting ability in the past;
31.4;?;Lee to Roach, no run back in the crease and defends;
31.3;1;Lee to Sammy, 1 run missed chance, he gets away with a big top edge this time...another good bouncer that cramps him for room, Sammy goes for the pull and Doherty from short fine-leg can't steady himself under the chance and doesn't even get a hand on it;
31.2;4;Lee to Sammy, FOUR runs a good short ball and it costs Lee four...bounced and nipped into Sammy then took the inside edge which flew past Wade;
31.1;?;Lee to Sammy, no run aims for a full, swinging yorker which is dug out to the leg side;
30.6;1;Doherty to Sammy, 1 run he manages to keep the strike again by working this away;
30.5;?;Doherty to Sammy, no run pushed into the off side;
30.4;4;Doherty to Sammy, FOUR runs uses his feet, doesn't quite get it out of the middle but it's struck well enough wide of mid-on...late counter-attack from Sammy;
30.3;?;Doherty to Sammy, no run quicker and flatter, tucked into the leg side;
30.2;4;Doherty to Sammy, FOUR runs well struck again by Sammy - a hint of anger in these shots - as he goes down on one knee and slog-sweeps it flat through midwicket;
30.1;6;Doherty to Sammy, SIX runs and the first ball is dispatched into the stands. Dragged down very short by Doherty and Sammy pulls it high over deep midwicket;
29.6;1;Lee to Sammy, 1 run inside edge past leg stump means he keeps the strike;
29.5;?;Lee to Sammy, no run aims for the yorker and it comes out as a low full toss which is clipped to mid-on;
29.4;1;Lee to Roach, 1 run nicely played off the back foot with an open face and soft hands towards backward point;
29.3;?;Lee to Roach, no run back over the wicket, short of a length on off stump and defended to the covers;
29.3;1w;Lee to Roach, 1 wide pushed too far outside leg stump and an easy call for a wide;
29.2;?;Lee to Roach, no run banged in short again, Roach goes onto the back foot and defends down in front of short leg;
29.1;?;Lee to Roach, no run round the wicket, starts with a bouncer that sails over Roach's back;

28.5;?;Doherty to Sammy, no run nearly does with this one which scoots through quick and it's defended off the back foot;
28.4;?;Doherty to Sammy, no run onto the front foot and defends with bat and pad together;
28.3;W;Doherty to Narine, OUT that's four for Doherty and he's been gifted most of them. This time Narine tries to clear long-on put doesn't get the distance and it's a simple catch. What a sad display from West Indies;Sunil Narine c Bailey b Doherty 0 (5m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
28.2;?;Doherty to Narine, no run round the wicket, on off stump, defended on the front foot;
28.1;1;Doherty to Sammy, 1 run touch short from Doherty, gives Sammy time to go onto the back foot and drive out to deep cover;
27.6;?;Christian to Narine, no run outside off and left alone;
27.5;W;Christian to Pollard, OUT this demise is proving very rapid. Another limp dismissal as Pollard chips to midwicket trying to drive, another batsman finding timing hard on this surface. Australia closing in swiftly.;Kieron Pollard c Bailey b Christian 4 (20m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 36.36;
27.4;1;Christian to Sammy, 1 run back of a length, driven towards mid-off and they set off for the single straight away so even if David Hussey had hit direct he was safe;
27.3;?;Christian to Sammy, no run dabbed into the off side;
27.2;?;Christian to Sammy, no run full outside off and pushed firmly to cover;
27.1;1;Christian to Pollard, 1 run worked out to deep square leg;
26.6;W;Doherty to Russell, OUT big appeal for a stumping...and gone! Wade was very confident. Russell stretched forward and was beaten by the spin. His foot appears to be on the line, but it's a tight call. The third umpire has given him, a brave decision from the TV official. West Indies sink further.;Andre Russell st ?Wade b Doherty 1 (8m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
26.5;?;Doherty to Russell, no run slightly quicker this time and defended off the back foot by Russell;
26.4;1;Doherty to Pollard, 1 run finds the gap this time with an open face this and the sweeper is in action;
26.3;?;Doherty to Pollard, no run on the back foot and driven to cover;
26.2;?;Doherty to Pollard, no run pushed out to midwicket from a leg-stump line;
26.1;?;Doherty to Pollard, no run flighted on middle and leg, straightens and touch and is defended to the on side. How long can Pollard resist?;

25.5;?;Christian to Pollard, no run takes the pad and a strangled shout from Christian...replays confirm it was going down the leg side;
25.4;1;Christian to Russell, 1 run onto the front and pushes out to the cover sweeper;
25.3;?;Christian to Russell, no run plays back and defends;
25.2;1;Christian to Pollard, 1 run loses his line down the leg side, Pollard connects well with his flick but picks out fine leg;
25.1;?;Christian to Pollard, no run beaten outside off stump as he tries to guide this square through the off side;
24.6;W;Doherty to Baugh, OUT this time he's gone! Aims an ambitious sweep and is taken on the back leg right in front of middle. Another awful piece of shot selection considering the match position;Carlton Baugh lbw b Doherty 0 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
24.5;?;Doherty to Baugh, no run played to the on side;
24.4;?;Doherty to Baugh, no run we have a review from Australia against Baugh first ball. Appeal for lbw as he's beaten on the back foot and it's given not out. Doesn't look out, missing leg stump? Well, it's just clipping the outside of leg stump so the on-field call stands;
24.3;W;Doherty to Samuels, OUT another goes. What was Samuels thinking? Comes down the pitch to launch this over the leg side and gets an outside edge which is well taken at slip. Watson will have been unsighted for a while. Pretty ungainly from Samuels given a wicket had just fallen;Marlon Samuels c Watson b Doherty 35 (86m 58b 2x4 3x6) SR: 60.34;
24.2;?;Doherty to Samuels, no run driven to mid-on;
24.1;?;Doherty to Samuels, no run angled in towards the right hander who defends coming forward;
23.6;?;Christian to Pollard, no run defended comfortably to midwicket;
23.5;W;Christian to Bravo, OUT and there's his reward! A lovely delivery from Christian, another off-cutter which bites in the surface and zips between bat and pad to take off stump. Bit of a loose shot, but credit to the bowler for his consistency. Just what Australia needed as West Indies had settled nicely with this stand;Dwayne Bravo b Christian 32 (46m 43b 5x4 1x6) SR: 74.41;
23.4;?;Christian to Bravo, no run he's keeping it simple, on a length around off stump, and it's again defended;
23.3;?;Christian to Bravo, no run worked to midwicket and can't beat the man inside the circle;
23.2;?;Christian to Bravo, no run good length, accurate from Christian, and it's defended to the bowler;
23.1;?;Christian to Bravo, no run off-cutter outside off stump which is played to backward point;
22.6;1;Doherty to Bravo, 1 run flicked through the leg side wide of midwicket;
22.5;1;Doherty to Samuels, 1 run hops onto the back foot and places this through the covers;
22.4;1;Doherty to Bravo, 1 run driven out to the cover sweeper;
22.3;?;Doherty to Bravo, no run half an appeal from Wade but no-one else as Samuels comes forward and is taken on the pad...going down the leg side with the angle;
22.2;?;Doherty to Bravo, no run played into the covers;
22.1;?;Doherty to Bravo, no run nicely flighted on off stump, turns a little and is defended to cover;
21.6;?;Christian to Samuels, no run opens the face to backward point...would have been maiden without that misfield;
21.5;?;Christian to Samuels, no run played from the crease to the leg side;
21.4;4;Christian to Samuels, FOUR runs well, you don't see that very often from Australia...Shane Watson has let a ball through his legs at mid-off which has gifted West Indies a boundary. Was a well-time drive, but Watson should have stopped it;
21.3;?;Christian to Samuels, no run tight lines from Watson and it's played off the front foot to cover;
21.2;?;Christian to Samuels, no run driven firmly but straight to mid-off;
21.1;?;Christian to Samuels, no run defended with soft hands to backward point;
20.6;?;Doherty to Bravo, no run defended on the off side;
20.5;?;Doherty to Bravo, no run played off the front foot;
20.4;4b;Doherty to Bravo, 4 byes that's a huge heave from the batsman and he's connected with nothing, the ball pitched middle and turned past off, just missing the stumps, it beat the keeper as well;
20.3;?;Doherty to Bravo, no run defended on the front foot;
20.2;?;Doherty to Bravo, no run that ball has jumped off the pitch away from the right-hander, big turn, and Wade does well to collect;
20.1;?;Doherty to Bravo, no run defended on the front foot;
19.6;?;Christian to Samuels, no run full length and straight, defended back to the bowler;

18.2;?;Doherty to Bravo, no run defended on the front foot;
18.1;4;Doherty to Bravo, FOUR runs and Bravo welcomes him, whipping the ball off his pads and over the head of the fielder at midwicket, he came a long way out of his crease to hit that;
17.6;?;Christian to Samuels, no run defended from the crease towards the off side;
17.5;?;Christian to Samuels, no run he lets another one go outside off stump;
17.4;?;Christian to Samuels, no run this time Samuels strides forward and shoulders arms, Christian got that ball to move towards the keeper's right, but after it passed the batsman;

15.6;6;Doherty to Samuels, SIX runs that's the biggest of them all, Samuels has stepped out of his crease, got to the pitch of the ball, and lofted it straight over the bowler's head again, I don't think we'll be seeing Doherty during the Powerplay any more;

15.3;6;Doherty to Samuels, SIX runs that's been dropped beyond the long-off boundary! Samuels stepped out of his crease and blasted the ball flat and far, hitting it with a lot of power;

10.6;W;Watson to Bravo, OUT Bravo's been run out! He pushed the ball off his pads towards wide mid-on and took on Brett Lee, who is a phenomenal athlete even now. Lee swooped on the ball after sprinting to his left and let the throw rip at the stumps at the bowler's end, hitting them with Bravo yards out of his crease. He had played that off his front foot and didn't hesitate that much before running, he still did not have a chance;Darren Bravo run out (Lee) 4 (20m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 26.66;

9.5;?;McKay to Bravo, no run played towards point;
9.4;?;McKay to Bravo, no run nips back from a good length, takes an inside edge into the pads and rolls towards square leg;
9.3;?;McKay to Bravo, no run beats the edge, a pretty loose shot from Bravo as he tries to force it off the back foot but was playing a long way from his body;

8.3;?;Lee to Samuels, no run slower ball from Lee and it almost deceived the batsman but he picked it at the last moment and didn't push too hard which could have led to a catch;
8.2;?;Lee to Samuels, no run a much more solid defensive shot this time as he plays into the off side;

7.1;?;McKay to Samuels, no run stays outside off stump, Samuels comes half forward and defends to backward point;

6.5;?;Lee to Bravo, no run leaves his first ball outside off;
6.4;W;Lee to Powell, OUT oh dear, that's very soft. Dropped in short by Lee, Powell went for the pull but lobbed a simple catch to mid-on who took it neatly at head-height;Kieran Powell c Bailey b Lee 8 (30m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 42.1;

4.5;?;Lee to Powell, no run moment of good fortune, he aims another booming drive and this time it comes off the inside edge and flies past the stumps to short fine-leg;
4.4;?;Lee to Powell, no run goes very full, but not quite yorker-length, and it's dug out to mid-on;
4.3;4;Lee to Powell, FOUR runs lovely shot, big stride forward to a full delivery and drives strongly square through the off side past point;

3.3;?;McKay to Samuels, no run played into the leg side;
3.2;?;McKay to Samuels, no run good length on off stump, looked like an off-cutter from McKay, and it's defended backward of square on the leg side;
3.1;W;McKay to Charles, OUT early strike, a flashing drive from Charles and he played it with such power that it carried comfortably to third man where the fielder took a good catch coming forward. Charles was only going to play one way.;Johnson Charles c Hussey b McKay 13 (15m 11b 3x4 0x6) SR: 118.18;
2.6;?;Lee to Powell, no run not able to find any gaps in that over and it ends with another flowing drive that picks out one of the cover ring;
2.5;?;Lee to Powell, no run comes onto the front foot and plays with a slightly open face to backward point who leaps to field the field;
2.4;?;Lee to Powell, no run a nice-looking, punchy drive straight to short cover;
2.3;?;Lee to Powell, no run on off stump this time and draws a shot from Powell as he drives to cover;
2.2;?;Lee to Powell, no run pushes this one up a foot further outside off and the batsman isn't interested in playing...looks like he's leaving the shot-making to Charles;
2.1;?;Lee to Powell, no run outside off stump and Powell shoulders arms;
1.6;?;McKay to Charles, no run banged in a bit shorter, Charles' eyes light up at the prospect of a pull but he slightly loses his shape on the shot and misses out;
1.5;?;McKay to Charles, no run now he's back in defence to a delivery on off stump;
1.4;4;McKay to Charles, FOUR runs driven on the up, fine start by Charles. Was full outside off and he drilled it past mid-off with a high follow through. Well balanced;

1.1;?;McKay to Charles, no run his first delivery doesn't bounce much on off stump and Charles jabs down to keep it out;
0.6;1;Lee to Charles, 1 run targets the leg side again, but this time doesn't connect as cleanly as he pulls a good-length delivery from off stump to deep square-leg. Certainly not playing Lee's reputation;
0.5;4;Lee to Charles, FOUR runs fetch that! Dismissive way to get off the mark as he picks this up from outside off stump and swings it through midwicket. Nice way to treat Brett Lee.;
0.5;1w;Lee to Charles, 1 wide swings down the leg side but had started on the wrong line as well...the umpire gets to stretch his arms;
0.4;?;Lee to Charles, no run good line on off stump and decent pace, defends from the crease and point does the fielding;
0.3;?;Lee to Charles, no run beaten first up, shapes away nicely from the right hander and curves past the outside edge...slightly tentative footwork from Charles;
0.2;1;Lee to Powell, 1 run touch of extra bounce outside off, he rides it well and guides the ball to third man to open the scoring;
0.1;?;Lee to Powell, no run outside off, left alone and carries at waist-height to Matthew Wade;

Brett Lee with the new ball...
Welcome back to the second half of this one-day international. Gnasher here for the first part of the chase. West Indies probably marginal favourites, but it won't be easy on a slow pitch. Meanwhile, here's Brydon Coverdale's report from the first innings.
