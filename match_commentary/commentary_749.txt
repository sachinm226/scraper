Welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the sixth match of the Champions Trophy. Today's game is between Australia and England, and with all the hype over the Ashes, lets hope the fireworks on the field match Jaipur's Diwali celebrations. I'm George Binoy and, with Sriram Veera, I'll be taking you through the day's events.
The pitch for today's game is the same one used for the India-England fixture that had only 251 runs in the entire match. The dew in Jaipur is far more than what we've had in Mumbai and the toss will play a vital role again. Both England and Australia have lost their first games which means that the loser today will find it extremely hard to progress from the group.
In the 2004 Champions Trophy, England beat Australia in the semi-final at Edgbaston by six wickets. During the 2005 season, England and Australia shared the NatWest series after the final was tied and then Australia beat England 2-1 in the NatWest Challenge that followed. All that, however, was before the Ashes and England's 2-1 triumph still rankles the Australians. Expect them to come out firing.
Toss: Ricky Ponting has won a crucial toss and as expected Australia will bowl first to aviod the dew later in the evening. Andrew Flintoff says he's not too fussed about batting first but stresses that their top-order batsmen need to come good.
Team news: Australia have brought in Mitchell Johnson for Brad Hogg, the chinaman bowler. England have retained the same team that was dismissed for 125 against India. Flintoff wont be bowling today so Adam Gilchrist can breathe just a little more easily.
The players are out there on the field. England continue their experiment of opening with Ian Bell but it will be Andrew Strauss who takes strike. Brett Lee has the new ball, steaming in from over the wicket. Here we go, the start of the Ashes appetiser ...
 Innings Start
England imploded after a good start. 10 wickets fell in the space of 83 runs. Maybe a diwali gift to Australia. Despite a mini-hiccup early in the chase, Australia have wrapped it up without too much sweat. That's it from us. Join us on 24th for the South Africa v Sri Lanka match at Ahmedabad. Goodbye and good luck. Ta!

We're moments away from the start of Australia's chase. They need only 170 and are favourites to win. England, however, should not be written off. Australia's batsmen choked in their loss against West Indies and England will feel they can cause similar flutters if their bowlers come good.
Much will depend on how Steve Harmison fares. He had a horrid outing against India when he often bowled at all the fielders behind the wicket and not at the batsmen. However, James Anderson will begin England's defence, bowling over the wicket to Adam Gilchrist while Shane Watson looks on from the non-striker's end. There's one slip in place.
