Innings break Brilliant finish from Pakistan. Imad made 28 not out from 13 balls in a sensational cameo on a slow pitch. The innings was held together by Haris Sohail who makes his maiden ODI century. Australia need 281 to win this first ODI.
We apologise for the technical difficulties in that innings with the scoring and commentary. We will hopefully have them sorted for the run chase.
Imran: "Is Australian bowler forgot about bowling YORKER!? Haven't seen any one bowling Yorker in depth overs since India went to aus . Reason ?" Not sure. I suspect they felt the slowness of the surface meant balls banged in would be harder to hit.
Yasir Lodhi: "Fall of Faheem Ashraf's wicket was blessing in disguise. Imad should have promoted ahead of Faheem."

The players are out in the middle. Jhye Richardson will open the bowling. Iman-Ul-Haq is on strike with Shan Masood on ODI debut at the non-striker's.
2.55pm The teams are out there and are observing a minute's silence for the tragedy that occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, seven days ago. And now the two national anthems.
2.50pm Ten minutes away from the first ball. The surface looks a very typical Sharjah pitch. Very dry with mosaic cracks all across it. There's cloud cover which is rare.
Nitish: "I like this move of dropping Turner. Whist he did show his capability in the series against India, it was on pitches that comparably fast. The ball did come on to the bat very well in at least 3 games. Its the opposite in Sharjah--slow and low. Expecting a low scoring thriller."
Asad Cheema: "Rizwan inclusion is a surprise to me, i dont know for how long he will be tested as a back up wkt keeper batsman. Pak has been failed in producing a genuine wkt keeper batsman in Sarfaraz absense. It should be their genuine concern."
2.30pm Toss Pakistan has won the toss and will bat first.
Pakistan XI: Shan Masood, Imam-ul-Haq, Haris Sohail, Umar Akmal, Shoaib Malik (c), Faheem Ashraf, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Mohammad Amir, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Abbas
Australia XI: Aaron Finch (c), Usman Khawaja, Peter Handscomb, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Shaun Marsh, Alex Carey (wk), Nathan Coulter-Nile, Jhye Richardson, Nathan Lyon, Adam Zampa
Mohammad Hasnain has not been selected for his debut. Shan Masood debuts at the top of the order. Umar Akmal has been listed to bat at No.4 behind Haris Sohail on his return to the International side. Mohammad Abbas will make his ODI debut after tormenting the Australians in the Test series back in October.
Australia has incredibly left out Ashton Turner and Shaun Marsh is listed to bat at No.6. Pat Cummins has been rested and Nathan Coulter-Nile also returns to the side after missing the last three ODI's in India due to the birth of his second child.
Dr bilal: "surprised husnain is not playing, he should have been included instead of abbas( test bowler)"
Mutahir: "I think they should give a chance to Ahmad shehzad also"
Nisar: "What ? Ashton Turner not playing? I don't understand the move."
2.20pm There was some concern that Glenn Maxwell may not play today due to illness but he has his pads on in the warm up so we shall see at the toss.
Rayhan: "was it right to rest Sarfraz for this series and check bench strength under Shoaib Malik??" We'll find out. Coach Mickey Arthur was comfortable with the plan.
Mohammed Nasir : "Happy to see Mohammed hasnain in Pakistan squad against Australia, may be he was releasing some pressure from Mohammed amir, good luck Mohammed hasnain and Mohammed amir too."
2.00pm Hello and welcome to Sharjah for game one of this five match ODI series between Pakistan and Australia. This is the final leg of a three format series that began back in October. Pakistan won the Test series 1-0 and the T20 series 3-0 but the ODI's were held back until now as part of both teams preparation leading into the World Cup.
Here is Danyal Rasool's preview of today's clash. Pakistan are resting a number of front line players including the captain Sarfaraz Ahmed ahead of the World Cup. Australia are on a winning roll having won the series against India after claiming the last three matches.
Salman: "1-0, 3-0, and is it gonna be 5-0 now?" Big ask given how many experienced players are out for Pakistan.
Marvin Odafa: "Make or break for Khawaja if he wants to get into the World Cup XI..." He might have already cemented his spot after two centuries and a 91 in the India series. The question is, can Aaron Finch find some form before David Warner becomes available for the World Cup?
qudsiya: "Hey! Are Smith and Warner expected to play?" Smith and Warner will not play in this series. They were only available for the last two games and the Australian selectors opted to allow them to go and play in the IPL instead of staying with the squad. They did spend a couple of days in camp in Dubai.
 Innings Start
Australia win by eight wickets and that's four wins in a row now. A very efficient run chase, led by Aaron Finch's century which Shaun Marsh supporting him well. It never really looked in doubt from a long way out. Earlier, Australia's spinners did a very good job on a slow surface as Pakistan never really got away from them with the bat. Haris Sohail made a good hundred, and there was a bit of a dart in the final five overs, but there was a lack of power for much of the innings. Australia's one-day momentum continues to build nicely. Who'd have thought it a month ago? There are four more matches in this series, the next of them on Sunday so it's a quick turnaround.
Shoaib Malik "Early strikes were missing from our side. Must say the way Finch and Marsh batted, they controlled the innings and took it deep. You can always make things better, we gave away some extra singles when batsmen are set. A few areas to improve. I would like to congratulate Haris on scoring a hundred coming back from injury. A great sign for Pakistan cricket."
Aaron Finch (who is also Man of the Match) "It was to chase down that total, was pretty daunting but it played really well in the second half. Nice to hit a few in the middle. I think doing it two-down was a real positive for us. There's a been a few times recently where it might have got to 6 or 7 down. The way Shaun played was a huge bonus to take the pressure off me. Just great to get the win. There's still room for improvement but nice to get four wins in a row. Nice that people are seeing the rewards for some hard work."
That just about wraps things up for today. Thanks for staying with us during the earlier problems. We'll be back on Sunday. Until then, from Gnasher and Alex, it's goodbye.
