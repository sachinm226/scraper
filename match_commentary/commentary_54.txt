Data
5.00pm Some late hitting by Handscomb steered Australia to 288 for 5, at one stage it looked like they might get 275 at the most. Batting first, Australia lost Finch early but Khawaja and Marsh stabilised the innings. However, that came at the expense of scoring rate. The two added 92 in 111 balls. Stoinis was sent ahead of Maxwell but struggles initially, but redeemed himself a bit towards the end. India's struggled at the death and ended up conceding 93 in the last ten, but they would still think it's withing their reach.
India certainly missed Jasprit Bumrah during the business end of the innings. Gaurav Sundararaman tells me that since 2018, he has been India's best bowler in the last ten overs, going at a miserly 3.92 per over. Bhuvneshwar, meanwhile, is at the other end of the spectrum, giving away 8.17. In terms of wickets as well, Bumrah leads the way with ten scalps in 113 balls, Bhuvi has only four from 138.
We will be back with the chase soon. And meanwhile, don't forget to vote here where does Australia's latest ODI kit rank among their greatest.

 Innings Start
Australia go 1-0 up in the three match series. The next game is in Adelaide on Tuesday. On behalf of all the team thanks for your company tonight. Look out for Andrew McGlashan's post-game coverage from the SCG. For now goodbye, and hopefully we see you Tuesday.
9.37pm Presentation Virat Kohli: "We're not very pleased with the way we played. I think we were fine with the ball. That wicket was 300 plus par. I think we did well with the ball. We thought 288 was quite gettable. Losing three wickets upfront is never good. I thought Rohit was outstanding and MS supported him but I thought we could have done better with the tempo of the game and we fell short. They took the game deep to give us a chance. MS got out at that stage. That put pressure on Rohit. One more good partnership and we would have got close. But losing three wickets up front was the problem and Australia were professional enough not to let us back in. I think we have to take it as a day when Australia played better than us. We're not too stressed about results. I think days like these make you aware of things you have to work on as a team."
Aaron Finch: "Very pleased. We knew that they'd try and take it deep and luckily we were able to take wickets and stem the flow. I thought we were around par. I thought with the earlier start, dew wouldn't come in. We felt the wicket would slow up a bit so I thought it was par. I thought the partnership between Khawaja and Marsh set us up and Pete Handscomb payed a gem. Anytime you get a team three down early and three big guns it's very important. I thought Jason handled his nerves brilliantly. And then the youngster Jhye is full of confidence and he's got a bright future ahead of him. There's always room to improve."
Jhye Richardson is Player of the Match for his career best 4 for 26. Richardson "Credit to them. They gave us a run through the middle. But like Finchy said when you get teams three down that's what you aim for. Getting (Kohli) is one that I'm going to treasure for a long time. But more happy to get the win."
Australia win by 34 runs. An upset to start the series. Australia defend 288 despite a magnificent century from Rohit Sharma. India were 3 for 4 early, Behrendorff and Richardson striking upfront. Richardson removed Kohli and Rayudu. Rohit and Dhoni rebuilt. But Dhoni was unfortunate to be given out LBW and the chase never recovered despite Rohit making 133.
