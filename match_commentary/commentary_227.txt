Data
6.20pm Australia have plundered 126 runs in the last 10 overs to run up 378 for 5, the second-highest total at the Manuka Oval. Warner, who struck his sixth ODI century of the year, and Smith, who made 72, set a strong base for the hosts. Head and Marsh then launched from there, scoring brutal half-centuries. Amid the carnage, Santner's figures of 1 for 47 stand out. New Zealand need 379 to stay in contention for the Chappell-Hadlee trophy.
Josh: "Anyone else missing Baz right about now?"
Alo Kapfo: "Good to see Marsh get some runs. Its all well and good to contribute when the team is doing well. Still need to see a gritty innings among ruins. The test series in India should fix that hopefully."
Jon: "How would NZ have done if they had batted rather than fielded?"
Davy: "Poor captaincy from Williamson in that innings. Bad choice at the toss, too defensive with fields straight away and very poor management of his bowlers."

39.1;W;Southee to Smith, OUT as easy as they come for Santner.

Warner waited briefly for the no-ball check but eventually walks off.;David Warner c Williamson b de Grandhomme 119 (149m 115b 14x4 1x6) SR: 103.47;

35.4;?;Boult to Warner, no run this one's full and straight on off stump, pushed to cover;
35.3;4;Boult to Warner, FOUR runs low full toss on the pads, tickled into the fine leg boundary. Buffet bowling this, as Geoff Boycott would say. All he had to do to get a boundary was a faint deflection, which he did.;
35.2;?;Boult to Warner, no run too full outside off, squeezed to cover;
35.1;6;Boult to Warner, SIX runs Boult floated this in at 135 clicks, it went to the deep midwicket fence at double that speed! One heck of a shot. Warner fetches the full ball from outside off and swings across the line. Super stuff.;

34.1;?;de Grandhomme to Smith, no run nips back in to hit him on the box. He went outside the line of the stumps to pull that behind square. He seems to be in some pain too and is flat on his back;
33.6;4;Southee to Warner, FOUR runs poor effort from Matt Henry at third man. Dives full length but the timing is such that he had no chance despite that. Too full and wide, Warner did well to reach out and pick the bones out of that. Super placement;
33.5;1;Southee to Smith, 1 run punched to deep cover as they pick an easy single again;
33.4;4;Southee to Smith, FOUR runs this has been clobbered over wide mid-on. Clears his front leg, and lofts the length ball over the infield without much fuss.;
33.3;?;Southee to Smith, no run the length ball nips back in from outside off, Smith played outside the line as he looked to ease it behind point. The ball missed everything. The appeal wasn't spontaneous either, and in the end, the right call has been made. No under-edge. Smith survives and rightly so;

31.6;?;Southee to Warner, no run play and a miss. Not much width to play the cut. That kept a touch low as well and went through.;
31.5;?;Southee to Warner, no run doesn't get the placement right this time. Slow off-cutter that has been hit straight to cover point;
31.4;1;Southee to Smith, 1 run short and wide outside off, eased behind point as they jog the single;
31.3;1;Southee to Warner, 1 run slower delivery on off, squeeze back down the pitch to get to the hundred. There's a typical leap, the joy is writ large on his face. His third hundred in five ODI innings. Can he convert this into a daddy hundred?;
31.2;?;Southee to Warner, no run looks to flay that through cover, gets it off the bottom of the bat and to the man on the edge of the ring. Cry of anguish as he executed the stroke;
31.1;?;Southee to Warner, no run slower and fuller on the pads, Warner misses a faint tickle to get him through to the century. Deflects off the pad to the keeper;

30.5;?;Neesham to Warner, no run full and tailing away from middle, squeezed back down the pitch;
30.4;4;Neesham to Warner, FOUR runs that's a hit! Wow, straight as a dye. The bowler had no time to even put his foot out. Such ferocity in his batting. Too full and he gave it the treatment.;
30.3;1;Neesham to Smith, 1 run punched on the up sweeper cover;
30.2;2;Neesham to Smith, 2 runs width and he's crashed that behind point. Top class effort from Latham to run around at least 20 yards to his right and throw himself full stretch to stop that. Saved two;
30.1;4;Neesham to Smith, FOUR runs full on the pads, flicked with an air of disdain. Split deep square and fine leg perfectly. Big boundary there, but it didn't matter.;

17.1;?;Southee to Warner, no run low full toss, Warner could have actually swung across but instead waits and waits for it and ends up nearly yorking himself as he digs that out;
16.6;?;Santner to Smith, no run shaped to drive but ended up defending solidly once he realised he was beaten in flight;
16.5;1;Santner to Warner, 1 run slow turn back in, Warner was standing outside leg in anticipation of a full ball, just works it wide of square leg this time;
16.4;?;Santner to Warner, no run quicker one on middle and leg, tucked to square leg;
16.3;?;Santner to Warner, no run gets to the pitch of the ball and dabs a tossed up delivery back down to the bowler;
16.2;?;Santner to Warner, no run steps out but this one drifts away to beat the flick and hit him on the right thigh. Excellent from Santner. That's more like it.;
16.1;1;Santner to Smith, 1 run eased with the spin to long-off, too full from Santner on that occasion;
15.6;1;Southee to Smith, 1 run gets half-forward and bunts it towards cover, which is a little deep, and they get a single easily;
15.5;?;Southee to Smith, no run shapes to cut but realises the ball's too full for him to slash, lets it go instead;
15.4;?;Southee to Smith, no run this is superb from Southee. This one's pitched up. The ball deviates away a wee bit, and Smith watches it through to the keeper;
15.3;?;Southee to Smith, no run hops across to punch it into the gap at point, but this one jags back in to hit the inside edge and roll to the leg side;
15.2;?;Southee to Smith, no run this one nips away off the seam from length outside off, left alone;
15.1;1;Southee to Warner, 1 run full delivery angling away, squeezed between cover and point;
14.6;1;Santner to Warner, 1 run solid wrist work again as he eases it to wide long-on for an easy single to keep strike. Sensible stuff;
14.5;1;Santner to Smith, 1 run makes a bit of room and punches that in-drifter to long-off;
14.4;?;Santner to Smith, no run this is fired full on middle from around the stumps, he stretches forward and blocks;

14.1;1;Santner to Smith, 1 run drifting into middle and leg, worked off his hip past square leg;
13.6;1;Southee to Smith, 1 run excellent stop by the skipper. Throws himself to his left to pull off a one-handed stop. That was travelling, saved three runs.;
13.5;?;Southee to Smith, no run this is too full, he doesn't get underneath it. Jams his bat down to keep that out though;
13.4;?;Southee to Smith, no run gets across and squeezes this full delivery to Williamson at cover;
13.3;4;Southee to Smith, FOUR runs delightful straight drive. Too full and the confidence from the first ODI speaks. He shuffles across just a touch and drills it down the ground past mid-on. Super timing;
13.2;?;Southee to Smith, no run short of length delivery around the sixth stump outside off, Smith watches it through to the keeper;

12.4;1;Santner to Smith, 1 run worked off his hip to deep square and gets off the mark;
12.3;?;Santner to Smith, no run some purchase off the pitch. This one turn's away from off stump, but Smith is half forward as he defends;
12.2;W;Santner to Finch, OUT so the dropped chance didn't cost them much. Finch looks to play a predetermined sweep. Was across a long way even before the ball was delivered, so he was in no position to sweep that full delivery. He swung through way too early as well as the ball sneaked through to crash into the leg stump. Timely wicket for New Zealand. Australia were starting to run away with this.;Aaron Finch b Santner 19 (53m 34b 2x4 0x6) SR: 55.88;
12.1;?;Santner to Finch, no run tossed up on middle, he gets forward and pats it to the off side;
12.1;1w;Santner to Finch, 1 wide drifts this back into middle and leg, Finch attempts a sweep and manages a glove. The keeper fluffs a relatively simple chance. Wide called;
11.6;4;Southee to Warner, FOUR runs superb hand-eye coordination. Picks the length so early. Stayed back in the crease, waited for it and flayed it behind point. Those wrists. Superb. Square third man was a mere spectator.;
11.5;?;Southee to Warner, no run back of length delivery on off stump, he hops back and bunts it to short cover;
11.4;1;Southee to Finch, 1 run half-volley on the pads, flicked with the angle to deep fine leg. The fielder there didn't have to move an inch;
11.3;1;Southee to Warner, 1 run digs a short ball into the body, not alarming bounce, neither was the pace that threatening. Warner gets on top of the bounce and deflects it wide of square leg;
11.2;1;Southee to Finch, 1 run length ball that slides into middle and leg, worked to mid-on as they sneak in a single. Warner trusted his partner's call and took off in a jiffy;
11.1;1;Southee to Warner, 1 run;
10.6;1;Santner to Warner, 1 run worked off his hip to square leg. Warner's just played a series of dots. Wow;

10.4;?;Santner to Warner, no run this is much better, slower through the air and lands it at length on middle, Warner stretches forward and blocks;
10.3;?;Santner to Warner, no run gets to the pitch of the ball and hammers it straight to Williamson at cover;
10.2;4;Santner to Warner, FOUR runs just short of Neesham at short third man. Too full for the cut, Warner still went through with it and managed to get a thick edge that raced past the man there for a boundary;
10.1;?;Santner to Warner, no run slides a short ball across the batsman, cut away but straight to point;
9.6;2;Boult to Finch, 2 runs short of a good length and angling away outside off, Finch leans back and square-cuts away;

8.6;2lb;Henry to Finch, 2 leg byes glanced off the pads to fine leg;
8.6;1w;Henry to Finch, 1 wide another bouncer outside off, Finch is upright as the ball soars over him to Watling. Second wide of the over;
8.5;?;Henry to Finch, no run full and in the channel, left alone now;
8.4;2;Henry to Finch, 2 runs good length and seams away outside off, Finch is on the move again. He drives and sends an outside edge flying to the left of first slip. Just one slip in place;
8.3;?;Henry to Finch, no run pitches outside off and nips away outside off, Finch is on the move as he drives and is lavishly beaten;
8.3;1w;Henry to Finch, 1 wide big bouncer outside off, Finch drops his wrists on it. Wide called by the square-leg umpire;

8.1;2;Henry to Warner, 2 runs full and wide outside off, Warner throws his hands at it and carves it up and over point. Warner's feet were stapled to the crease;
7.6;1;Boult to Warner, 1 run short and just outside off, short-armed away to square leg;
7.5;1lb;Boult to Finch, 1 leg bye veering into the leg stump, off the pad and rolls behind square;
7.4;?;Boult to Finch, no run an appeal for leg-before from Boult. He chats with Williamson. The time's up. Back of a length and swings back in, Finch leaps and is struck above the knee-roll. That's definitely missing the stumps. It pitched outside leg and darted in, and was sailing over the stumps;
7.3;?;Boult to Finch, no run pitched further up, and angling away outside off, Finch covers his off stump and lets it be;
7.2;?;Boult to Finch, no run back of a length and swings in, Finch aims a cut, and drags an inside edge to midwicket;

6.6;1;Henry to Warner, 1 run low full-toss outside off, punched straight to mid-off;
6.5;4;Henry to Warner, FOUR runs dug short and outside off, 140ks, Warner read the length early. Skipping back and nailing a pull over square leg. Kumar Dharmasena swerves out of the way, and evades it;

6.3;?;Henry to Finch, no run good length on off, forward and firmly punched to mid-off;

4.2;?;Henry to Warner, no run back of a length and outside off, leaps and jabs to the covers;
4.1;?;Henry to Warner, no run that's a gem from Henry. Beats the outside, and nearly shaves the off stump. Too good to even kiss the edge, too good to even kiss the stump. Good length - shapes like an inswinger - pitches on leg, and then viciously seams away, opening up the left-hander. That's the magic ball;

Around the wicket
 Innings Start
10.20pm Australia have bounced back, and how. They lost 5-0 in the ODI series in South Africa. They came back home and were beaten 2-1 in the Tests. The seniors were under pressure here, but have they delivered or what? David Warner made a typically bruising century to set things up along with Steven Smith before the supercharge from Mitch Marsh and Travis Head got them past 370. In the chase, this was all about Guptill v Australia. He threatened briefly, but once he fell, it was a steep task. As well as Neesham and Williamson played, the escalating asking rate meant they were always in danger of falling to one big shot. Once they fell, Australia had it easy. Pat Cummins did his reputation no harm whatsoever, while Starc did what Starc does. Easy, then. 2-0 Australia with one to play at MCG.
David Warner, Man of the Match: It was a fantastic wicket, here at the Manuka. Once you keep wickets it hand, you can take 100 in the last 10. Early on I was hitting as well as I would have liked. The other day I played a lazy stroke. And it was great batting with the skipper, and run between the wickets. This year is going great.
Kane Williamson: The way they batted, and executed with the ball, 380 is a tough total. If we knew they were going to get 380, then maybe I would wind back [toss?]. Neesham carried on after the blow and hit some. I am sure he will be alright. Australia is one of the best side in the world, and at home they are the best side in the world. The death overs really hurt us, and Australia have been showing us how to build partnerships.
Steven Smith: 330, 340 was probably par. 380 was a big total. You needed a lot of things to go right if you need to chase it down. Warner set us up, Head and Marsh played well. It was a good batting deck, but the ball can reverse a bit in the night, and we have got some good quicks who bowl at good pace and tail the ball in. Cummins really switched it on today. He changed his pace at times, and he is quality prospect. We will hold the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy for six wickets before we head to New Zealand. It would be nice to keep the winning ways going.
That is all we have for you from this game. Thanks for reading. Cheers
47.2;W;Faulkner to Watling, OUT how fitting is it for Warner, the centurion, to take the catch? Australia have taken the Chappell-Hadlee series. Watling swings but doesn't get under that full delivery and ends up slicing it towards Warner, who circles around the ball briefly at cover, before settling underneath it to complete a comfortable catch.;BJ Watling c Warner b Faulkner 17 (37m 22b 2x4 0x6) SR: 77.27;
47.1;?;Faulkner to Watling, no run slower delivery angling away, flayed to the point fielder;
46.6;?;Hazlewood to Boult, no run clears his front leg and clobbers that to mid-off, calls 'wait' immediately. Can't beat the infield;
46.5;?;Hazlewood to Boult, no run makes room and squeezes a yorker-length delivery to cover;
46.4;1;Hazlewood to Watling, 1 run walks across the stumps and swings leg side, gets a bottom edge towards short fine leg;
46.3;?;Hazlewood to Watling, no run crunching drive, Boult was more than a couple of paces in for a run. Smith could have thrown it down at the bowler's end but he stopped short of doing that. May have cost Australia a run at max.;
46.2;4;Hazlewood to Watling, FOUR runs that's a lovely hit. Backs away and slap the length ball over extra cover. The bat face slightly turned in his hand, but he ensured there was enough power;
46.1;1;Hazlewood to Boult, 1 run swings and gets a thick inside edge towards the keeper. Watling was off the blocks, but Boult, who was ball-watching, had to really scamper through to make the crease even as the throw came whistling in to the bowler's end. A direct hit and he was gone.;
45.6;1;Cummins to Boult, 1 run no, he can't. Excellent slower ball on middle, Boult gets an inside edge to the leg side and gets off the mark;
45.5;?;Cummins to Boult, no run punched to point from the crease;
45.4;?;Cummins to Boult, no run right into the blockhole from wide of the crease, Boult just about manages to dig that out in the nick of time;
45.3;1;Cummins to Watling, 1 run mistimes a pull to deep midwicket. Watling wanted the second but Boult wouldn't have made it back;
45.2;?;Cummins to Watling, no run backs away and bunts an imcoming length ball to the off side;
45.1;W;Cummins to Henry, OUT hit well, but he's picked out the lone man at deep midwicket. Swung through the line to pull that short delivery, but it was almost as if he forgot there was a man in the deep. Nice, running catch from Faulkner. Ran to his left, was aware of the boundary behind him and pouched it safely. Hit and miss knock from Henry is over.;Matt Henry c Faulkner b Cummins 7 (14m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 53.84;
44.6;1;Starc to Henry, 1 run looks for a yorker but turns out to be a high full toss on the body, tucked wide of midwicket as they take a single;
44.5;2;Starc to Henry, 2 runs backs away and lofts this one into the gap at cover, two it will be;
44.4;?;Starc to Henry, no run three in a row. On another night, Starc would have shattered the stumps many times over. Floats this full and into the batsman from around the stumps, Henry swings over long-on but misses;
44.3;?;Starc to Henry, no run he can't lay bat on ball at the moment. Looks to swipe this over the infield, but the ball tails away late to beat his swing;
44.2;?;Starc to Henry, no run another swing and a miss. Backs away to slap that length ball over cover but he was nowhere near the ball;
44.1;1;Starc to Watling, 1 run full-length delivery on off, driven to long-off;
43.6;?;Cummins to Henry, no run swing and a miss. He looked to hit that to Sydney, but could only connect with the cool evening air. Went for a mow over cow corner but played too early;
43.5;?;Cummins to Henry, no run backs away to go over cover, but gets it off the toe end to the fielder there;
43.4;1;Cummins to Watling, 1 run drilled down the ground but straight to Head at long-on;
43.3;?;Cummins to Watling, no run excellent bouncer but way over the batsman's head. Watling did well to spot that early and duck under it;

43.1;2;Cummins to Henry, 2 runs slower and fuller outside off, swung across the line to toe-end it towards deep square;
42.6;?;Starc to Watling, no run play and a miss. This was too close to cut, the ball shaves past the inside edge;
42.5;1;Starc to Henry, 1 run juicy full toss that has been slashed over the infield to deep cover;
42.4;?;Starc to Henry, no run how did that miss the off stump? I don't know. This one's fired full and into the stumps from around the stumps, the batsman went for an almighty thwack but missed it completely;
42.3;?;Starc to Henry, no run stands still inside the crease and pushes the length ball to mid-off;
42.2;1;Starc to Watling, 1 run swung across the line, gets the toe end but the ball lands short of the man running in from long-off;
42.1;?;Starc to Watling, no run firm push off the frontfoot but straight to cover;
41.6;1;Cummins to Watling, 1 run chopped behind the wicket and they scamper a run;
41.5;W;Cummins to Southee, OUT pace and bounce does the trick again. Southee was in no position to play a flat-batted pull. The ball got big on him, he was cramped for room and only managed to get a top edge to Bailey, who took a simple catch coming in from midwicket.;Tim Southee c Bailey b Cummins 2 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
41.4;?;Cummins to Southee, no run way too early into the pull, gets a bottom edge that goes through to Wade on the bounce;
41.3;?;Cummins to Southee, no run backs away to slash over point but the steep bounce did him in. The ball also kept coming back in to cramp him for room;

38.4;W;Starc to de Grandhomme, OUT edged and taken by Wade diving low to his right. Wide of the crease, very full and holds its line outside off.
