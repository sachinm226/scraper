Well, what do we make of that from Australia? Apart from Aaron Finch, it felt pretty ordinary. However, all credit to England. They bowled very impressively, spin playing a key role with Root chipping in with two wickets, and Eoin Morgan's captaincy and tactics were outstanding. England didn't have any problem chasing over 300 a few days ago so they'll be hugely confident of hunting this down. Australia are short of experience in the bowling attack, but you never know. We'll be back at 5.30pm for the chase.

 Innings Start
9.02pm Right, that's your lot. Thanks for joining us today, have a read of Dan Brettig's report and join us again on Sunday for the third ODI in Sydney, where Australia desperately need a win to stay alive in the series.
Sarvesh : "Even without Stokes, England ODI side is a force to reckon with. They were the most competitive in India among visiting teams last year, after South Africa. They played really well in South Africa before that. I m in favour of a whitewash in Australia !!! " Watch this space. They are clearly a team in a very good frame of mind at the moment. Good night.
9pm Man of the Match is Joe Root for his wickets and runs. "Enjoyable today, didn't think I'd bowl seven overs at the start of the day. The form Smith has been in this summer, very enjoyable to see the back of him."
"Whenever you come off a series loss you want to prove a point, and leading into the World Cup we want to set a benchmark. We had to stay cool in the moment and get the job done."
Eoin Morgan: "Our bowlers were exceptional. It puts pressure on the Australia batsmen. We did enough to win but it was far from a complete performance, which is exciting for us."
"We have a level of trust and confidence in the group that someone will put their hand up for us."
8.55pm Time for some presentations. Here's Steve Smith. "We're not playing good enough one-day cricket at the moment. It's a quality England batting line-up. We lost a couple of wickets in a row, we couldn't get that power going at the back end to get that 320 we were after."
"Richo bowled pretty well, perhaps [we should have played a spinner]. This wicket is different to the one we had for the Test match."
8.47pm England have won their first ODI at Brisbane since 1999, and they have taken an emphatic 2-0 lead without really being stretched in two apparently daunting chases.
Hypocaust: "Joe Root now has the 3rd highest average (87.06) in victorious ODI chases (min. 20 innings), behind Dhoni (102.72) and Kohli (93.64) and just ahead of Bevan (86.25)."
Mark: "Are we facing a scenario where Australia's total domination of the Tests will be countered by England's total domination of the ODIs and T20s. You begin to wonder if Australia could be whitewashed."
Deedat: "Like Morgan said last time, if Roy fails, someone from the rest of the team would step up. This time, seems like who whole team did. Magnificent from Hales and Bairstow. And just solid as always from Root"

11.6;1;Tye to Bairstow, 1 run fuller, straighter, punched to cover;
11.5;4;Tye to Bairstow, FOUR runs too short, too wide, too repetitive from Australia's quicks. Interspersing excellent deliveries with rank long-hops, and England are cruising at the moment;

8.2;2;Head to Bairstow, 2 runs swept square;
8.1;?;Head to Bairstow, no run a big appeal but Bairstow is so far down the track that it is guesswork... Smith declines the review, though it might have been tight...;

5.1;?;Jhye Richardson to Hales, no run tight line, defended;
4.6;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run sharp bouncer and that's cracked Bairstow on the side of the grille like a right hook! He's fine, the lid does its job as the ball bobbles into the gully. Actually, it looked like the breastbone on second viewing.;
4.5;4;Starc to Bairstow, FOUR runs that's sublime. Fuller length, tighter line, drilled through the covers;
4.4;4;Starc to Bairstow, FOUR runs too short, too wide. Starc is not getting it right often enough in this spell, and Bairstow batters a cut through point. No swing back into the right-hander, so the wider line is a freebie;

2.4;4;Starc to Hales, FOUR runs a loose full toss outside off. That's a rank delivery from a fine bowler, and Hales picks his spot, behind square on the off side, with a dismissive slap;
2.3;?;Starc to Hales, no run dabbed to cover;
2.2;4;Starc to Hales, FOUR runs short, and pumped with firm forearms through midwicket. That sat up and begged;
2.1;?;Starc to Hales, no run a long-levered drive into the covers, smothered with a dive;
1.6;?;Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, no run punched off the back foot to mid-off. A very fine first over from the new boy;
1.5;?;Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, no run forward again, this is genuinely brisk from Richardson, skidding low from a low trajectory;
1.4;?;Jhye Richardson to Bairstow, no run jeepers, how did that miss! Fast and full, and Bairstow was beaten for pace, under-edging a defensive push off the toe of his bat and past the off stump!;

It was the swing wot won it, aiming straight, looking for the lbw, Roy's bat came swishing across the line but couldn't stay on top of the shot. A good low grab from Finch to lift Australia's spirits;Jason Roy c Finch b Starc 2 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
