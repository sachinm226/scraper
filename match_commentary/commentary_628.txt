14.2;4;Hoffmann to Hayden, FOUR runs Thwack! Hayden had enough of pottering around. Thrust his front foot out and swung through the line.;
14.1;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Guess where this was bowled? Yep, full, straight and on that off and middle stump line, turned to point.;
13.6;1;Wright to Hayden, 1 run tip and run. Length delivery on the off and middle, Hayden taps it towards mid-off, one look at Gilchrist who responds favourably and off they go;
13.5;1;Wright to Gilchrist, 1 run Full, inviting a drive, Gilchrist obliges with a inside-out effort and the cover fielder makes a half-stop;
13.4;?;Wright to Gilchrist, no run sliding down to the pads, Gilchrist tries to tickle it away, fails and it runs off the pads to short fine leg;
13.3;1;Wright to Hayden, 1 run back of length, on the off stump, Hayden punches it to right of mid-off for a single.;
13.2;?;Wright to Hayden, no run angled away, turned straight to point;
13.1;?;Wright to Hayden, no run Full and straight, no deviation whatsover, on the middle stump line, worked to midwicket;
12.6;?;Hoffmann to Gilchrist, no run Almost squeezed between bat and pad. Fullish, on the middle stump line, again Gilchrist's right foot is planted across and he tries to drive it around his pad. It doesn't work and he gets a inside edge and the ball rolls down the track;
12.5;?;Hoffmann to Gilchrist, no run lands on a length, on the middle, goes on straight, Gilchrist thrusts his right foot across and defends;
12.4;?;Hoffmann to Gilchrist, no run slightly overpitched, on the off stump line, driven to mid-off;

12.2;1;Hoffmann to Gilchrist, 1 run Again full in length, sliding away and Gilchrist late cuts it to thirdman. Ala Arjuna Ranatunga;
12.1;?;Hoffmann to Gilchrist, no run on the middle and off stump, full in length (they have been pretty good with the length so far), worked to the on side;
11.6;?;Wright to Hayden, no run short of length, gentle pace but Hayden is not going to be sucked into any over-ambitious swipe across the line. He just pushes it to cover point;
11.5;?;Wright to Hayden, no run honing in on the off stump, pushed to cover region;
11.4;1;Wright to Gilchrist, 1 run;
11.3;4;Wright to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Mis-field! Poonia is the culprit. Gilchrist times his offdrive well and Poonia, at long off, doesn't time his sliding dive well.;
11.2;?;Wright to Gilchrist, no run full, straight, on the leg and middle, Gilchrist gives his wrists some rest, just turns it to midwicket;
11.1;2;Wright to Gilchrist, 2 runs on the hips, Gilchrist pivots to flick it to fineleg region and will come back for two.;

10.2;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run just short of driveable length, on the off and middle, Hayden thrusts forward and smothers the delivery.;
10.1;2;Hoffmann to Hayden, 2 runs Fullish, on the middle and leg stump line, deflected to the on side for a single;
9.6;5;Wright to Hayden, 5 runs on the middle stump line, Gilchrist turns it to left of mid-on who fires in a throw. Rebounds off the batsmen's bat and runs away to the boundary. Four extra runs. Such is life, such is this game.;
9.5;1;Wright to Gilchrist, 1 run sliding away from Gilchrist who shapes to cut but the length is not that short and it runs down towards short thirdman region;
9.4;?;Wright to Gilchrist, no run goes back to a back of length delivery, pushes it out to cover region;
9.3;1;Wright to Hayden, 1 run gentle seam-up stuff, outside off, Hayden opens the bat-face, runs it past point for a easy single.;
9.2;1;Wright to Gilchrist, 1 run Short and Gilchrist immediately pushes back to pull it to deep midwicket;
9.1;?;Wright to Gilchrist, no run Full and outside off, left alone. The wicketkeeper Smith is standing up;
8.6;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run pushes it across Hayden who shoulders arms.;
8.5;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Again on a good length, around that off stump, Hayden just leans forward without thrusting his foot out, pushes it out to short cover;

8.1;1;Hoffmann to Hayden, 1 run Full, straight on the middle stump line, Hayden leans forward, places it to left of mid-on;
7.6;?;Blain to Gilchrist, no run Similar delivery and straighter. Patted back down the ground. Australia not doing anything reckless here, just going after the loose deliveries and that seems to be enough;
7.5;?;Blain to Gilchrist, no run Blain back to probing outside off. That's something he has been doing really well. Gilchrist shoulders arms and has nothing to do with it;
7.4;2;Blain to Gilchrist, 2 runs Full and on the pads, drilled easily to midwicket for a couple;
7.3;4;Blain to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Short ball from Blain and Gilchrist is up for the challenge. Pulls with a mighty swing and a thick top edge files over short fine-leg for a one-bounce four.;
7.2;?;Blain to Gilchrist, no run Straight and accurate from Blain. Gilchrist gives it the respect it deserves and defends it back to the bowler;
7.1;?;Blain to Gilchrist, no run Wide and slightly back of a length. Gilchrist goes for the fierce slash but can't time it. Straight to the cover fielder;
6.6;4;Hoffmann to Hayden, FOUR runs Too wide from Hoffmann. The first real rank delivery and Hayden punishes it with a slash through covers. Ball races away to the point fence;
6.5;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Defended off the back foot;
6.4;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Quite a bit of swing into the batsman. No room for Hayden, as he tries to repeat the stroke. Cramped for room and brings his bat down in the last moment. Appeal for lbw but that was going down leg;
6.3;6;Hoffmann to Hayden, SIX runs Blitzer! Hayden walks down the wicket nonchalantly and dismisses the ball over the long-on fence for a cracking six. Hayden at his bullying best there.;
6.2;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Back of a length delivery and luckily it was straight. Hayden, standing outside his crease, was lining up an almighty swing. Checked his shot in the last minute;
6.1;1;Hoffmann to Gilchrist, 1 run Tip and run from Gilchrist. Tapped to cover and Gilchrist steals an easy single. Short cover comes into place for Hayden;
5.6;?;Blain to Hayden, no run Shade of inswing from Blain. Hayden defends it back to the bowler;
5.5;2;Blain to Hayden, 2 runs Good seam movement again. Pitched on leg and moving away from the left hander. Hayden gets away with a thickish edge that squirts past gully for a brace;
5.4;1;Blain to Gilchrist, 1 run Short ball from Blain. Not that quick though and Gilchrist rocks back and turns it square on the leg side for an easy single;
5.3;?;Blain to Gilchrist, no run Straight and back of a length this time. Gilchrist on the back foot and defends it confidently.;
5.2;4;Blain to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Ouch! Too close to the body and Gilchrist gets away with a wild slash. Thick edge flies over first slip for another boundary. Moral victory for Blain - if ever there's anything like a moral victory;
5.1;4;Blain to Gilchrist, FOUR runs Typical Gilchrist response. Blain pushes it too full and Gilchrist smashes it through the extra cover region. Surely it must have burnt some grass on the way to the fence;
5.1;1nb;Blain to Gilchrist, (no ball) Oh! No ball called but quite a handful for Gilchrist. Teasing outside off and moving it away off the seam. Gilchrist beaten comprehensively that time;
4.6;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Left alone outside off. Good probing over that;
4.6;1w;Hoffmann to Hayden, 1 wide Wide ball conceded but good swing to encourage the bowler. Starts on middle and leg and swings at a fine arc. Hayden has nothing to do with one way down leg;
4.5;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Easy run-up and smooth follow-through. A typical English action with some swing in the air. Hayden lets it go outside off;
4.4;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Straighter line, Hayden whips it square on the leg side. Tries to pinch a single but Gilchrist screams a denial;
4.3;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Full ball. Nice easy action from Hoffmann. Full ball on off and Hayden cracks it straight to the short extra cover fielder. Good stop that time;
4.2;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Shifts his length this time, back of a length and straighter. Going away from the left-hander just a shade. Hayden adjusts in the last minute and keeps it out;
4.1;?;Hoffmann to Hayden, no run Full length delivery outside off, slightly shaping away from the left-hander. Hayden lets it go watchfully;

In 1979 WC, the first three matches, the teams which won the toss inserted the opposition in to bat. Just like this WC.
 Innings Start
This is the third time in World Cup history that a team has won with a 200+ margin. England achieved it against India in the first edition and then Australia did it against Namibia in 2003. Good outing for Australia: runs for the top order and wickets for Glenn McGrath.
Man of the Match Ricky Ponting
40.1;W;Hogg to Smith, OUT Sharp turn there! Cleans up Smith. Lands outside off stump and spins back sharply. He shapes to cut but is surprised by the turn and its all over. Good outing for Smith. This is the 48th instance of a batsman registering 50+ score on World Cup debut. Since Blain is injured and won't bat, Australia have sealed up a facile win.;Colin Smith b Hogg 51 (93m 76b 7x4 0x6) SR: 67.1;
39.6;W;Bracken to Smith, OUT A run out! offcutter on the off stump line, pushed towards Hayden who rushes in from point and rolls it along the ground to Gilchrist - lost some time there but still fast enough to catch the batsman short.;Glenn Rogers run out (Hayden/?Gilchrist) 6 (29m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 31.57;

38.5;?;Hogg to Rogers, no run;
38.4;1;Hogg to Smith, 1 run fifty up for Smith. His colleagues in the pavilion stand up to applaud. Scottish fans in the arena clear their lungs. Maiden fifty. Only the second Scottish batsman to get a fifty in WC. On the legs and swept away to long leg;

34.2;4;Tait to Smith, FOUR runs Or. As Colin Smith prefers back away and clatter it past gully for a sizzling boundary;

33.6;?;Hodge to Rogers, no run Well tossed up outside off, batsmen in a quandry about whether to attack or defend and chooses the safer option in the last moment. Silly point waiting for the edge but it drops short;

32.4;4lb;Tait to Wright, 4 leg byes Speared down leg again. Thank heavens Tait isn't a fighter pilot. His sense of direction is so awry. Batsman simply has to kick it away to the fine leg fence. Looked more like byes though;
32.3;1;Tait to Smith, 1 run Back of a length and on off. Smith jabs to the off side and takes off for a single. 100 comes up for Scotland and the crowd is ecstatic;
32.2;?;Tait to Smith, no run Short and wide outside off. Steepling delivery and Smith's waft can only strike the air. Tait too fast for Scotland. Now if only he could get his direction more often;
