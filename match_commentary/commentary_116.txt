3.49pm Well, that was a curious innings. Record-breaking on the one hand, but oddly underwhelming on the other. It's a measure of the heightened expectations around this England team, I guess. But credit to Australia for hauling the runaway train back in the latter overs. It's a quick turnaround after the rain. Alan will be here in 15 minutes. See you then!

6.5;4;Agar to Bairstow, FOUR runs squashed through point, and up comes England's fifty in dismissive fashion. Too much width and tonked to the rope!;

6.3;4;Agar to Roy, FOUR runs thwacked with intent, up and overs the covers! One, two, three bounces and into the rope. Selective and dismissive;

1.5;4;Kane Richardson to Roy, FOUR runs slammed to the fence! You can't bowl there to any international batsman, or most club batsmen, to be fair. Short, wide, and in the slot for the cut;

0.1;1;Jhye Richardson to Roy, 1 run decent pace first-up but sliding into the pads, Roy is off the mark with a nudge to leg;

10.58am Right, let's play some cricket. Out come the England openers, and you suspect that Jason Roy in particular will be grateful not to have Stanlake bearing down on him. Jhye Richardson is rapid though... this will be fun.
10.47am Well, that was more dramatic than expected. Morgan's 69 was crucial to England's victory at The Oval. Two wicketkeeper-captains today, which is unusual.
John Gillett: "I think that's a bit harsh on Neser, especially given he can bat a bit as well" Needs must, I guess ... but agree, he showed some good ticker on his debut.
Matt Russell: "I might be missing something here, but why is Root not looked into as a captain in the coloured clothing?" Slightly curious isn't it? Maybe they are determined not to overburden him with too much responsibility across all formats.
10.40am Here comes the toss. But Eoin Morgan has had a back spasm. He is out of the game Jos Buttler will captain in his absence
Heads is the correct call, and Australia will bowl. Short is in for Neser, and as flagged, Stanlake is out, Jhye Richardson comes in. He's got wheels.
"It's a bit overcast and it might swing," reasons Tim Paine, not unreasonably.
"I found out 20 minutes ago," says Buttler re the captaincy. "We were going to bat, with the weather around it would have been a bit of a tricky decision."
Sam Billings is confirmed as Morgan's replacement.
England: 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Jason Roy, 3 Alex Hales, 4 Joe Root, 5 Sam Billings, 6 Jos Buttler (capt & wk), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 David Willey, 9 Liam Plunkett, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Mark Wood
Australia 1 Travis Head 2 D'Arcy Short, 3 Shaun Marsh, 4 Marcus Stoinis, 5 Glenn Maxwell, 6 Aaron Finch, 7 Tim Paine (capt & wk), 8 Ashton Agar, 9 Andrew Tye, 10 Kane Richardson, 11 Jhye Richardson
10.35am George Dobell has finishing scoffing welshcakes at the back of the press box and pops up with a bit of worrying intel re Australia. "Billy Stanlake is a doubt with a toe injury," he says. That would be a massive blow, he was quality at The Oval.
10.30am It looks as though the toss is going to be pushed back to 10.40am, but the groundstaff are still hopeful of a prompt 11am start. We shall see
10.25am The suggestion from the front line is that D'Arcy Short could be set to make his ODI debut today. Potentially a switch at the top with Travis Head, but all will be revealed shortly.
10.20am Brandon: "Croeso/Welcome! Unfortunately the skies are not that welcoming. At the ground in my poncho and feeling a light drizzle already." Humbug. What a lovely Welsh welcome!
Asher: "Australia must play 7 batsmen. There's no need for the extra bowler - Maxwell, Finch, Head, Stoinis and Short all bowl and can easily make up 10 overs." You have to say there is a strong case for that, especially given how impressive Australia's frontline quicks were at The Oval. A few more runs to defend and they could have been in business.
10.10am There's a hint of light rain lurking around the ground this morning, but hopefully it'll all blow over by the start of play. Still 20 minutes to go until the toss.
Obviously, you wonder if Australia will mind terribly about a delayed start, seeing as they are not the nation's only sporting team set to kick off at 11am today. The Socceroos are getting their World Cup campaign underway against France. Follow the action at ESPN.com right here!
9.30am Good morning, and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's coverage of the second ODI between England and Australia at Cardiff. It was a peculiar opening contest to this five-match series - England won emphatically in the end, but their three-wicket margin was another reminder that their gung-ho attitude isn't always the smartest approach to take to every contest. Still, they've cemented their No.1 status after that indignity against Scotland last week, and it's Australia's batting that offers the bigger concerns.
So, what can we expect from Match 2 of this rubber? Alan Gardner ran the rule over the two teams and the conditions in his preview yesterday.
And are Australia on course for redemption after their scandal-dogged tour of South Africa? They've certainly arrived with a few new ideas from their captain-coach combo of Tim Paine and Justin Langer.
 Innings Start
7.55pm: Right, well, that was a thoroughly enjoyable bun fight. George Dobell's report is in, so we'll wrap things up for the day. The furore seems to have died down a bit in St Lucia, where West Indies look set for a first-innings lead (you can read about the latest ball-tampering controversy here); from Miller and myself, it's goodnight and good luck, we'll be back for more when the series moves to Trent Bridge on Tuesday. Ta ra!
7.45pm: Time for the presentations, starting with Australia captain Tim Paine: "Obviously we would have liked to restrict them to less than 340, the way Shaun Marsh batted showed we could have chased but until Ashton came out we didn't get going. [Marsh ran out of help?] Would have been nice to have a wicket or two more in hand when he got going, unfortunately we couldn't get over the line. I think our best cricket is good enough to beat these guys, we just haven't put the complete package together. [Face okay?] Yeah, just a bad bounce."
England's stand-in captain Jos Buttler: [Nervous at the end?] "They were playing very well, and as you see all around the world, 10 an over is very achievable with a guy like Marsh playing well, but we had to keep going until the end. [Plunkett and Rashid] Two great wicket-takers for us over the past few years. Adil handled the pressure at the end very well, with batsmen coming after him, wickets for those guys was crucial. [Roy innings] Great to see, played well from ball one, I thought he paced it very well. We got into a position where we could have scored a few more, they bowled well at the end. Always nice to contribute, enjoy the captaincy, tricky at times and you always need the extra fielder out, but good fun. We're always striving to get better.
Jason Roy is Man of the Match: "Obviously nice to get over the line. [Stokes waiting in wings?] Yeah, never ever complacency, we want to better ourselves and match each other in every training session. [Bairstow aggression] It was amazing to watch, I was able to drop back and nudge it around, which was quite pleasing. It's difficult chopping and changing but we have developed a good partnership and friendship, so all good."
7.35pm: England held their nerve, taking a 2-0 lead in the series. Australia didn't quite have enough in junk in the trunk to get themselves up and over the line, despite a marvelous hundred from Shaun Marsh. It would have been a record chase for Australia, but there were too few contributions around the No. 3 - Ashton Agar's sprightly 46 was the next-highest score. Liam Plunkett and Adil Rashid were the beneficiaries of Australia's need to hit out, sharing seven wickets between them, but Moeen Ali again bowled a key spell to tie the top order down. England, with a century from Jason Roy and some pyrotechnics from Jos Buttler, just had too much power once again.

23.5;1;Plunkett to Maxwell, 1 run tapped firmly down the ground, a sharp single;

17.4;6;Root to Marsh, SIX runs humpty, at last! Marsh dances down and slots a sweet lofted drive over long-on for six! First one of the innings - first boundary in eight overs, in fact. And it has damaged the ball, so there is going to be a delay;
