Data
Career-best figures for Mitchell Johnson - also the fourth-best by an Australian in ODIs - have given Australia a target that they should chase down. The way Sri Lanka started, it seemed 300 was on but their top order threw away their wickets with aggressive shots chasing wide deliveries. Nuwan and Suraj have given them something to bowl at though. Join us in half an hour for the chase
Our stats man Madhu again: " Among bowlers who have at least 50 wickets in the subcontinent (away and neutral ODIs only), Mitchell Johnson's average of 20.41 is the third-best behind Allan Donald and Wasim Akram. His strike rate of 25.6 is the best among the bowlers in this group."

3.1;4;Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, FOUR runs lovely shot, Tharanga picks up four for this, it looked like it would fetch him a single at the best as he came forward and pushed a length ball without any followthrough, but the timing and the outfield took care of the rest and extra cover gave up the chase in the end;

1.2;4;Bollinger to Dilshan, FOUR runs this time he gets four, very well played, he was starting to lunge at this fuller one with a big backlift, then saw it was better to hang the bat and push with an open face, and timed it past a diving Lee in to the third man boundary;

2.27 pm All set for the start. Brett Lee, one away from 350 ODI wickets, has the new ball. Sri Lanka's openers walk out under sunshine, Tharanga, back from his ban, accompanies his captain. Two slips in place for Lee with Tharanga on strike
Gareth: "Am i missing something? How has Hastings been given the boot whilst Steve Smith is still being carried? I know we're lacking spin options, but this is getting beyond a joke!"
S Rajesh, our stats editor: "SL's record when they've won the toss and batted first in a home ODI since 2000: played 33, won 25, lost 5." He keeps coming up with such gems pretty regularly on Twitter @rajeshstats.
The DRS is being used for this series, one unsuccessful review per innings per side, including ball-tracking but not Hot Spot. Exactly inverse to what is being used in the series between England and India. Confused? Join the gang.
Shishank: "I think they should have played another spinner(Herath/Perera) here seeing how the Aussies struggled in the last match against the tweakers. Angelo can play the second seamer role."
Hugh: "Very important toss to win - Sri Lanka's spinners just look so much better than what Australia have thrown together - Doherty isn't an international player and while I'm a fan of Smith, he can't carry a spin attack yet. Angelo Mathews has to be one of the most valuable cricketers today - a smart and yet explosive batsman, a game-changing fielder, and his pretty decent bowling allows Dilshan to bring in an extra spinner."
Punit: "Congratulations to Mitchell Johnson on his 100th ODI Match..."
2.10 pm Russell Arnold says on air that batting against the new ball will be the easiest but thereafter it will get tougher and tougher with the dry surface having a few cracks as well.
Pitch expected to spin, Australia batting second. Are they up against it already or what?
2 pm: Sri Lanka win the toss and will have a bat
Dilshan: "Much dryer pitch and will help the spinners. We have two spinners and two seamers, and Jeevan Mendis as well. We need to definitely improve our fielding standards. I think 250+ will be a good total." Herath misses out as Mendis and Randiv are playing.
Clarke: "Wicket looks good, it is reasonably dry, no surprises for us, we have our work cut out. We've had a good chat and we'll have to back ourselves and play our way. Haddin and Watson will open, as they did during the World Cup." Lee, Bollinger and Johnson are Australia's three seamers with Doherty and Smith making up the spin attack.
1.55 pm This will be the first big test for Clarke after taking over the captaincy from Ponting after the World Cup. There was an ODI series against Bangladesh but Australia were hardly pushed in those games. The T20s against Sri Lanka have provided some glimpse of the challenges they will be up against in these conditions. Toss coming up in five minutes; it plays a big role in Sri Lanka with pitches slowing down as the game progresses.
1.45 pm Welcome to our coverage of the first game of the five-match ODI series between Sri Lanka and Australia. The Twenty20s are done with, and Australia will be glad that they will now have some more time to try and make sense of the web spun around them by the Sri Lanka spinners, especially Ajantha Mendis. They also have a more solid-looking middle order with Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey coming in for the ODIs. Not that they have played Mendis a lot before, in fact he hasn't bowled against Australia in an ODI or Test.
Nitin Sundar says in his preview that the series could well evolve into one that pits Australia's pace against Sri Lanka's spin.
 Innings Start
That will be all from us for this game. Join us for the 2nd ODI on Sunday from Hambantota. This is Abhishek Purohit signing off. Thanks for all the feedback. Cheers!
Clarke: "The wicket was fantastic, it was dry but held together better than I expected. It is important that I lead from the front, it is great having Ponting at No 3 with all that experience at the other end."
Mitchell Johnson is the Man of the Match for his 6 for 31. Johnson: "I enjoyed myself, good to get that win on the board after the Twenty20 losses, Brett Lee getting his 350th ODI wicket was exciting as well. I enjoyed getting Sanga out, always exciting to get one of their top players out."
Dilshan: "This was not a 190 wicket, we did not bat well. Our shot selection was not good, it was a good toss to win, I think our spinners bowled well, but they did not have the runs to defend."
Hang on for the presentation
