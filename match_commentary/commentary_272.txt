Data
Well, Jos Buttler was the man there for England, he really put the foot down in the last few overs and Australia will need 317 for victory - and they're missing four of their best batsmen, who are resting. The highest successful chase at the WACA was 274 by Pakistan back in January 1987. This will not be easy, but if someone like Aaron Finch gets going you just never know. Join us for the chase in half an hour.
49.6;4;Faulkner to Broad, FOUR runs no hat-trick for Faulkner and Broad has also managed to force a boundary through cover, well struck and that takes the total to 8 for 316;
49.5;W;Faulkner to Bresnan, OUT another catch at third man! Would you believe it? Bresnan has sliced this one off the edge and Johnson makes good ground to his left to take the catch;Tim Bresnan c Johnson b Faulkner 2 (12m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
49.4;W;Faulkner to Buttler, OUT Buttler's entertaining innings comes to an end, he's swung hard outside off and this slices off the top edge and flies away towards third man where Johnson comes in and takes the catch;Jos Buttler c Johnson b Faulkner 71 (52m 43b 6x4 4x6) SR: 165.11;
49.3;6;Faulkner to Buttler, SIX runs and that's why Buttler wanted the strike! Faulkner goes low on the pads and Buttler just picks this up off the legs and this flies over square leg and is put down by a spectator on the hill;
49.2;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run low full toss now and Buttler swings but finds mid-on - they turn down the single so Buttler can keep the strike;
49.1;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run Faulkner has the last over and he aims at the body, gives Buttler no room, and the batsman can't get it away;
48.6;1;Pattinson to Buttler, 1 run Pattinson goes well wide of off and Buttler slaps this in the air down the ground for a single;
48.5;?;Pattinson to Buttler, no run again Buttler tries to walk across and lap Pattinson over Wade but this time he doesn't make contact;
48.4;6;Pattinson to Buttler, SIX runs this is super stuff from Jos Buttler. Super stuff. He's now gone down the ground with a strong smash in the air straight back over the head of Pattinson and this flies 20 rows back into the crowd;
48.3;4;Pattinson to Buttler, FOUR runs four more as Buttler just flashes hard outside off and slices it uppishly between third man and point;
48.2;4;Pattinson to Buttler, FOUR runs Buttler picks correctly here as he walks across and laps Pattinson's slower ball over the head of Matthew Wade. Easy runs if he gets something on it, and he gets plenty on it;
48.1;1;Pattinson to Bresnan, 1 run good slower one from Pattinson at 113kph and it's surprised Bresnan by bouncing a little more than he anticipated - off the gloves for a single to fine leg;
45.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run full and wide of off, well bowled by Coulter-Nile as this was within the painted lines that guide the umpires on wides - but only just. Buttler reached with feet planted and couldn't get bat on ball;
45.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run tries for the yorker but it turns into a low full toss, it's clipped through square leg;
45.4;1;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run flicked away towards fine leg for a single;
45.3;6;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, SIX runs the Buttler serves up something special here! He's lifted Coulter-Nile over long-on, just a strong, well-timed shot that clears the boundary and goes a long way back. Hefty six, that;
45.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run Buttler backs off now and Coulter-Nile follows him, well bowled;
45.1;4;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, FOUR runs muscular pull from Buttler as he gets one that is barely too short, but he's forced it through midwicket where Finch can't quite get a hand on it;
44.6;?;Johnson to Morgan, no run left alone outside off, which is a touch surprising at this stage of the match;
44.5;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run pulls again and this one is collected in the deep;
44.4;4;Johnson to Buttler, FOUR runs even better now from Buttler, again he goes the pull but this is timed and placed better, fizzes along the ground and away to the boundary behind square leg;
44.3;2;Johnson to Buttler, 2 runs swivels a pull through square leg now and good running once again makes this into two;
44.2;4;Johnson to Buttler, FOUR runs well struck by Buttler as Johnson gives him a touch of width at a driveable length and Buttler obliges by punching this soundly through the gap at cover;
44.1;?;Johnson to Buttler, no run Johnson at 143kph beats Buttler outside off;
47.6;2;Faulkner to Buttler, 2 runs Buttler picks up two runs with a soft-handed nudge through square leg and that's his half-century, he's consistently offered something for England with the bat in this series;
47.5;1;Faulkner to Bresnan, 1 run Bresnan picks up a bouncer and hooks away to the deep midwicket;
47.4;?;Faulkner to Bresnan, no run Bresnan is the new batsman and he drives to mid-on;
47.3;W;Faulkner to Morgan, OUT Morgan is gone, he has flicked a low full toss from Faulkner to midwicket where Christian takes a pretty straightforward catch.;Eoin Morgan c Christian b Faulkner 33 (66m 33b 3x4 1x6) SR: 100;
47.2;6;Faulkner to Morgan, SIX runs another six, and this is starting to get away from Australia - Morgan went the slog off Faulkner and it turns into a top edge that flies away with the wind and over the head of fine leg;
47.1;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run slower one down leg and Faulkner is lucky Buttler manages only to swivel a single to fine leg;
46.6;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run Buttler swats a pull to Marsh at midwicket, his throw misses at the non-striker's end;
46.5;1;Johnson to Morgan, 1 run now it's Morgan who tries to lift Johnson over square leg for six - but this one doesn't quite make it, it bounces to Coulter-Nile in the deep;
46.4;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run miscues this one as he crunches it away to midwicket;
46.3;6;Johnson to Buttler, SIX runs Buttler clears the boundary again, and this one is square of the wicket - he's opened up his stance a little to clobber this up and over square leg - very, very well struck;
46.2;?;Johnson to Buttler, no run 129kph as Johnson drops short, Buttler goes the pull and his under-edge nearly clips the off stump on the way through to Wade - done for a lack of pace there;
46.1;1;Johnson to Morgan, 1 run good ball as Johnson goes full and straight - and slow - Morgan can only bunt it away to off for a single;
43.6;1;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run Buttler is on the back foot as this is again short of a length, he pushes a single behind point;
43.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run aims at the hips of Morgan, who just nudges a single to leg;
43.4;1;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run short again and this time Buttler hooks along the ground through square leg;
43.4;1w;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 wide bouncer from Coulter-Nile and Buttler shapes to hook then backs out - it's called a wide;
43.3;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run Morgan flicks it away through square leg and immediately takes off for the single;
43.2;1;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run again Buttler walks across his stumps and this time turns it behind square;
43.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run pushed back down into the ground by Buttler;
43.1;1w;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 wide Buttler tries to turn this one down fine leg but gets nothing on it - this is called a wide by Dharmasena and that seems a tough call, Buttler walked across his stumps and this was barely down leg at all;
42.6;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run turned away off the hips for another run to fine leg;
42.5;4;Johnson to Buttler, FOUR runs good placement from Buttler now as he drives wide of mid-off and this one runs away for four, all the way along the ground;
42.4;1;Johnson to Morgan, 1 run now it's the slower bouncer and Morgan goes the hook before picking the speed, then adjusts and swivels it finer;
42.4;1w;Johnson to Morgan, 1 wide down leg side now and that will be called a wide - Morgan went the big hook but couldn't connect;
42.3;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run on the pads and again Buttler works it away behind square;
42.2;2;Johnson to Buttler, 2 runs banged in at the hips and Buttler pulls it around the corner for a couple of runs;
42.1;?;Johnson to Buttler, no run soft hands as Buttler nudges to off but can't justify a single;
41.6;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run defended away safely again;
41.5;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run again slower from Faulkner, again picked by Morgan;
41.4;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run there's the slower ball out of the back of the hand, and Morgan drives hard into the ground and back to Faulkner;
41.3;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run this time they take the quick single to mid-on and Finch's throw misses at the non-striker's end - Buttler was probably quick enough to have been home anyway;
41.2;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run this time they take the quick single to mid-on and Finch's throw misses at the non-striker's end - Buttler was probably quick enough to have been home anyway;
41.2;1w;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 wide short ball from Faulkner and a delayed wide call by the umpire;
41.1;2;Faulkner to Buttler, 2 runs worked away off the pads through square leg and they've done well to turn this into two;
40.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run driven away to mid-off and can't beat the field;
40.5;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run defended back towards Coulter-Nile;
40.4;2;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 2 runs soft hands from Morgan as he edges this away safely wide of slip and third man does well to get across and cut this off;
40.3;1;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run tickled away to fine leg for a single;
40.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run worked away off the pads;
40.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run bouncer from Coulter-Nile and that could nearly have been called a wide, but he gets away with it;
39.6;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run worked towards mid-on who hits the stumps direct but Buttler is safe;
39.5;1;Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run fuller outside off, think it was a slower one, Morgan drives down to long-off;
39.4;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run that's better, adjusts his line to outside off and there's some extra bounce to take it through to the keeper;
39.3;4;Faulkner to Morgan, FOUR runs another short ball, but this time Morgan puts it away, angled towards leg stump and he helps it over short fine leg;
39.2;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run on leg stump, worked behind square;
39.1;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run short of a length on off stump, played into the covers;
38.6;W;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, OUT and now he's gone! England losing their way. A length delivery, Bopara tries to pull but can't get it over mid-on where Doherty runs backwards, keeps his eyes on the ball and holds a good catch;Ravi Bopara c sub (XJ Doherty) b Coulter-Nile 3 (12m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30;
38.5;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run tries to manufacture something now, moves outside leg to open up the off stump but can't make contact and is almost bowled;
38.4;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run straighter this time, worked off the stumps towards mid-on who can't stop a sharp single;
38.3;4;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, FOUR runs he's middled that okay...pushed up fuller outside off, allows Morgan to drive and he slots it wide of mid-off;
38.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run back of a length, played square to point;
38.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run beaten again as he tries to run down to third man...Coulter-Nile has come back well after his first two overs were expensive;
37.6;1;Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run opens the face towards short third man...just four singles off the over. Australia clawing back well.;
37.5;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run fuller this time, driven very firmly and it's the air for a while but falls short of cover;
37.4;1;Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run tucked off his hip behind square;
37.3;1;Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run short of a length, dropped square into the off side;
37.2;1;Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run opens the face into the off sid;
37.1;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run on off stump, defended to the covers;
36.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run nearly an edge as Morgan tries to run this into the off side, the ball slides across him over the top edge. Was a noise as the ball went past the bat;
36.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, 1 run nudged into the leg side to get off the mark;
36.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run touch shorter, played into the off side...four dot balls to build the pressure;

36.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run full outside off, defended square to point;
36.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run full outside off, Bopara comes forward and defends on the walk;
35.6;W;Faulkner to Stokes, OUT big wicket! Stokes tries to lap-sweep a slower ball but can only get a top edge that loops behind him and Matthew Wade trots around for the catch. They check the no-ball, it's very tight but is just okay. Bit close for comfort.;Ben Stokes c ?Wade b Faulkner 70 (93m 84b 6x4 1x6) SR: 83.33;
35.5;1;Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run fuller and pushed down the ground;
35.4;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run good comeback from Faulkner, nips this away off the seam as Morgan tries to open the face;
35.3;4;Faulkner to Morgan, FOUR runs down the pitch then up and over he off side, a length ball outside off and Morgan drives to deep cover;
35.2;1;Faulkner to Stokes, 1 run strong bottom hand from Stokes as he takes this from outside off down to long-on;
35.1;1;Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run starts full on middle and off, punched sweetly down to long-on and that's 200 for England;
34.6;4;Johnson to Stokes, FOUR runs lovely shot, pitched up on off stump and Stokes pings a punchy off-drive straight of a diving mid-off. Superb timing;
34.5;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run full on off stump, defended towards mid-on;
34.4;1;Johnson to Morgan, 1 run ooh, close! Full and he drives in the air just wide of point to get off the mark;
34.3;?;Johnson to Morgan, no run good delivery, fuller outside off stump and Morgan nearly feels for it before pulling his bat away at the last second;
34.2;?;Johnson to Morgan, no run gets a short ball first up, over off stump, Morgan sways out of the way;
34.1;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run short on leg stump, rolls his wrists on the pull down to long leg;
33.6;1;Pattinson to Stokes, 1 run full at off stump and worked down the ground to long-on;
33.5;2;Pattinson to Stokes, 2 runs short again, this time Stokes connects cleanly with his pull through midwicket;
33.4;W;Pattinson to Ballance, OUT that will boost Pattinson. Banged in a short, Ballance goes for the pull and gets a meaty top edge which goes now further than cover where Smith negotiates the sun to hold the catch;Gary Ballance c Smith b Pattinson 18 (42m 30b 1x4 0x6) SR: 60;
33.3;?;Pattinson to Ballance, no run short over middle and off, Ballance sways out of the line;
33.2;1;Pattinson to Stokes, 1 run shuffles across to off stump and flicks this in front of square on the leg side;
33.1;?;Pattinson to Stokes, no run comes at the bowler and bunts this straight down the pitch, Pattinson gets his right hand to it;
32.6;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run pulls a short ball over midwicket, more top edge than middle but it falls safely;
32.5;1;Johnson to Ballance, 1 run turns this delivery, which is short of a length, into the leg side;
32.4;?;Johnson to Ballance, no run good short ball, on off stump, and it climbs past Ballance's outside edge as he fends at it...close to the gloves;
32.3;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run dropped a little shorter outside off, driven square off the back foot through point out to the sweeper;
32.2;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run slower ball on off stump, 129kph, defended to cover;
32.1;4;Johnson to Stokes, FOUR runs cracking shot, superb piece of timing through midwicket...Johnson homing in on leg stump but Stokes whipped it away strongly;
31.6;?;Pattinson to Ballance, no run drives and misses, full outside off but Ballance was quite into the ball with his footwork;
31.5;?;Pattinson to Ballance, no run full outside off, driven on the up behind square on the off side;
31.4;4;Pattinson to Ballance, FOUR runs aims to guide this to third man, gets it finer than he wanted past the diving Wade but he benefits with a boundary;
31.3;1;Pattinson to Stokes, 1 run chopped down to third man;
31.2;?;Pattinson to Stokes, no run has this carried? Marsh, the catcher, isn't sure so it's not quite like the previous match. Was flicked firmly by Stokes and Marsh dived forward. As usual, will be tough to see on TV replays. Marsh immediately said he wasn't sure. Not much excitement from the fielders. And it's not out;
31.1;?;Pattinson to Stokes, no run plays and misses as he tries to drive on the up through the covers;
30.6;1;Maxwell to Stokes, 1 run driven out to the deep sweeper...another tight over from Maxwell;
30.5;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run pushed to the off side;
30.5;1w;Maxwell to Stokes, 1 wide almost a leg-side stumping, fired down the leg side but it was just too wide for Wade to get back in time;
30.4;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run picks out the fielder again, the same man at cover;
30.3;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run this drive firmly but straight at cover;
30.2;1;Maxwell to Ballance, 1 run gives himself some room towards leg stump so he can drive square through point;
30.1;?;Maxwell to Ballance, no run pushed to the off side;
29.6;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run drives down to the mid-off in the circle;
29.5;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run drives towards short cover and this time there's no thought of a run;
29.4;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run a hint of outswing and this also beats the bat of Stokes;
29.3;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run beaten outside off now;
29.2;1;Faulkner to Ballance, 1 run pushed away to the off side;
29.1;1;Faulkner to Stokes, 1 run punched away to cover and they take a quick single - and it's a run-out chance that goes begging! Coulter-Nile is not deep at cover and pounces, throws at the bowler's end and misses. But Ballance had given up on that - he was gone;
28.6;1;Maxwell to Stokes, 1 run defended away safely;
28.5;6;Maxwell to Stokes, SIX runs Stokes has had enough, he has advanced to Maxwell and lifted this over long-on for a really well-struck six that goes many rows back into the crowd, he just hit through the line of the ball and played it well enough to clear the boundary. And bring up his fifty;
28.4;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run tossed up a touch more and the cut can't beat the infield;
28.4;1w;Maxwell to Stokes, 1 wide quick and flat again, this one is down leg though;
28.3;1;Maxwell to Ballance, 1 run 93kph from Maxwell so he's bowling pretty quick at times, it's nudged away to leg for a single;
28.2;?;Maxwell to Ballance, no run angled on to the pads now and it's worked fine;
28.1;?;Maxwell to Ballance, no run cuts hard and this goes into the turf and back past Wade;
27.6;1;Faulkner to Ballance, 1 run Ballance waits on this and turns a single towards midwicket;
27.5;1;Faulkner to Stokes, 1 run steered away to third man now;
27.4;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run good ball beats the bat! Faulkner brought the length back just enough but Stokes was committed to trying a drive - the ball also nips away a tiny bit and beats the edge;
27.3;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run defended away to the off side;
27.2;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run Stokes has got this pull out of the middle of the bat but it's also smashed into the middle of Shaun Marsh's hand at midwicket - on the bounce;
27.1;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run cuts hard and finds the man at point;
26.6;?;Maxwell to Ballance, no run 93kph from Maxwell on the stumps, it's defended;
26.5;1;Maxwell to Stokes, 1 run drives along the ground to long-off;
26.4;1;Maxwell to Ballance, 1 run Ballance waits on this and plays late - cutting through point;
26.3;1;Maxwell to Stokes, 1 run advances and drives to mid-off;
26.2;4;Maxwell to Stokes, FOUR runs finally England go after Maxwell and rightly so, as he dropped too short here and was pulled confidently through midwicket;
26.1;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run pushed away to cover and can't beat the field;
25.6;1;Christian to Stokes, 1 run worked away for a single to end the over;
25.5;?;Christian to Stokes, no run Stokes walks across his stumps now and tries to work it behind short fine leg - can't beat him though;
25.4;1;Christian to Ballance, 1 run goes uppishly over the cordon again and bounces down to third man;
25.3;1;Christian to Stokes, 1 run Christian again goes well across the left-hander, who slashes hard and his edge flies down on the bounce to third man;
25.2;1;Christian to Ballance, 1 run worked away through midwicket along the ground now;
25.1;2;Christian to Ballance, 2 runs Ballance goes aerial now over midwicket and this just stops dead in the turf in the outfield like a well executed chip onto the green;
24.6;1;Maxwell to Ballance, 1 run wide of off and Ballance drives hard to deep cover;
24.5;?;Maxwell to Ballance, no run tries the late cut but it's too full and Ballance can't find the gap;
24.4;?;Maxwell to Ballance, no run driven hard back to the bowler;
24.3;?;Maxwell to Ballance, no run pushed away to mid-on and they can't find a run;
24.2;1;Maxwell to Stokes, 1 run on the back foot Stokes punches down the ground to mid-off;
24.1;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run Stokes goes for the big swing now and misses;
23.6;?;Christian to Ballance, no run again Christian just angles it across the left-hander, this time it very nearly tickles the edge on the way through to Wade;
23.5;?;Christian to Ballance, no run pushed down towards mid-on and can't beat the field;
23.4;1;Christian to Stokes, 1 run Stokes steers this through the vacant slip region and it's collected at third man;
23.4;1w;Christian to Stokes, 1 wide Stokes slashes hard outside off and this again is too wide from Christian - umpire Dharmasena is not having that;
23.3;?;Christian to Stokes, no run pushed away defensively to the off side;
23.2;?;Christian to Stokes, no run pushed right across Stokes, who leaves it alone;
23.1;1;Christian to Ballance, 1 run just waits on this one and dabs it towards off, they take off for a quick single and Maxwell running in from point fumbles;
23.1;1w;Christian to Ballance, 1 wide short and wide, beats Ballance and is also too wide for the umpire's liking - he's called it wide;
22.6;2;Maxwell to Stokes, 2 runs crunched through extra cover for a couple more;
22.5;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run Stokes uses the feet and drives back to Maxwell;
22.4;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run nudged away to off;
22.3;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run beaten outside off now as Stokes tries to cut late - he's cut too late to get any bat on the ball;
22.2;1;Maxwell to Ballance, 1 run on the back foot now and cut forward of point;
22.1;?;Maxwell to Ballance, no run driven away to cover and can't beat the field;
21.6;1;Christian to Ballance, 1 run Ballance gets himself off the mark with a drive through cover point;
21.5;?;Christian to Ballance, no run driven away towards point;
21.4;W;Christian to Bell, OUT Bell is gone! Oh, he'll be so frustrated at himself here. It was a bad ball down leg and Bell goes for the glance but fine leg is up in the circle and takes the catch easily! That didn't look like a plan from the Australians, just a fortuitous piece of, well, fortune.;Ian Bell c Faulkner b Christian 55 (92m 52b 9x4 0x6) SR: 105.76;
21.3;2;Christian to Bell, 2 runs Bell drives hard again over the infield and this one is into safe territory, between cover and mid-off and Coulter-Nile gets around to cut off the boundary;
21.3;1w;Christian to Bell, 1 wide Christian gets the line wrong now, down leg side for a wide;
21.2;?;Christian to Bell, no run 131kph from Christian on the stumps and Bell defends;
21.1;1;Christian to Stokes, 1 run fullish and wide of off, Stokes flashes hard and gets a thickish edge away to third man;
20.6;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run another drop! And again it was a really difficult one for Marsh at first slip. Stokes gets a genuine edge and this one flies to where second slip would have been - if there was one. Marsh dives to his left and gets the hand to this but it doesn't stick.;
20.5;4;Johnson to Stokes, FOUR runs clipped away well through square leg and Stokes picks up a boundary as Johnson goes too far towards leg;
20.4;2;Johnson to Stokes, 2 runs cut away for two into the deep;
20.3;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run oh, it's another life for Bell! This time Marsh at first slip has dropped it! Not an easy chance as Bell opens the face and tries to glide this wide of slip, it's within reach of Marsh who thrusts the hands up to his right and can't hold on, just parries the ball away towards third man;
20.2;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run Stokes goes for the pull off a bouncer here and it runs along the ground to deep square leg;
20.1;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run left alone outside off and this wasn't far away from the top of off;
19.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run pushed away defensively;
19.5;4;Coulter-Nile to Bell, FOUR runs oh dear, Pattinson has misjudged one in the deep and it has brought Bell his half-century. Bell went inside out over cover and Pattinson was on the boundary there, but he's taken too many strides in and misjudged this - the ball goes over his head and bounces for four! Had he stayed back that may have been a reasonably straightforward catch. A let-off for Bell.;
19.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run again Bell tries to steer this fine of point but again he's not quite got it fine enough;
19.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run dabs this away towards point;
19.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run Bell defends with a straight bat;
19.1;1;Coulter-Nile to Stokes, 1 run a touch short outside off and Stokes waits on this for a late cut into the ground;
18.6;3;Johnson to Stokes, 3 runs Stokes drives outside off and places this nicely between point and cover and the outfield is super fast - he didn't time it that well but this has almost reached the boundary;
18.5;2;Johnson to Stokes, 2 runs clipped away to Finch who is patrolling the deep midwicket boundary;
18.4;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run Johnson draws the edge from Stokes but this has fallen short of Marsh at first slip! And it's fallen quite a way short - perhaps Marsh is a touch too deep because you'd expect those to carry at the WACA;
18.3;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run goes the yorker again but it's just a touch short and Stokes keeps it out well;
18.2;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run lovely ball as Johnson goes fullish and swings this away late - Stokes drives at it just outside off and doesn't really get the bat near it;
18.1;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run probes outside off and Stokes leaves it alone;
17.6;4;Coulter-Nile to Bell, FOUR runs what a good shot this is! Bell leans forward and lifts Coulter-Nile over mid-off, it bounces away for a boundary. Initially it was hard to tell how well he'd timed it - the answer was very.;
17.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Stokes, 1 run waits on a late cut now and works a single behind point;
17.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Stokes, no run good bowling from Coulter-Nile here, he pushes it across Stokes on a good length and the batsman plays and misses;
17.3;1;Coulter-Nile to Bell, 1 run opens the face and steers the late cut down to third man;
17.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run yeah yeah no! That's the call from Bell as he nudges to off and nearly sells Stokes down the river - the no came quick enough for them to both get back safely though;
17.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run banged in shorter by Coulter-Nile and Bell now gets a leading edge - a few of them in the last couple of overs - just lobs back in front of him on the pitch;
16.6;1;Maxwell to Bell, 1 run turned away behind square leg now;
16.5;1;Maxwell to Stokes, 1 run goes the reverse sweep now and doesn't get this far past the keeper;
16.4;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run tossed up a bit more now and Stokes tries to defend, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad and it lobs up safely to leg;
16.3;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run tries to turn this to leg and it's another leading edge;
16.2;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run quickish from Maxwell, Stokes defends;
16.1;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run punched away to the off side;
15.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run pushed away to the off side;
15.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Stokes, 1 run oh, nearly a chance here! Stokes gets sick of the lack of runs this over and tries to close the face on this to work it to leg, instead it's a leading edge that lobs only just over the head of Maxwell at point;
15.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Stokes, no run drives clunkily down past the bowler;
15.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Stokes, no run good delivery, right length from Coulter-Nile and this nips away from around leg stump past the edge outside off - tough one for Stokes;
15.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Stokes, no run solidly defended by Stokes on off stump;
15.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Stokes, no run angled across Stokes, who drives hard and misses;
14.6;?;Maxwell to Bell, no run on off stump, skids on and it's defended to the covers;
14.5;?;Maxwell to Bell, no run short outside off, Bell cuts and gets beaten by some extra bounce;
14.4;1;Maxwell to Stokes, 1 run stretches forward and drives through cover to the sweeper;
14.3;2;Maxwell to Stokes, 2 runs swept again, well placed and it nearly reaches the boundary but deep square-leg is able to get the slide out;
14.2;1;Maxwell to Bell, 1 run goes onto the back foot and works this out to deep square;
14.1;?;Maxwell to Bell, no run brings out the reverse sweep, misses and gets taken on the pad...not quite sure that's needed right now;
13.6;4;Pattinson to Stokes, FOUR runs oh, that's a stunner...a stand-and-deliver on-drive is punched down the ground past a diving Pattinson in his follow through and too well timed for mid-on to have a chance;
13.5;2;Pattinson to Stokes, 2 runs on leg stump and it's flicked wide of deep square-leg;
13.4;?;Pattinson to Stokes, no run gets square up this time as he aims to leg and a thick outside edge falls short of point;
13.3;?;Pattinson to Stokes, no run full and wide, 140kph, Stokes chases it with a drive and gets beaten;
13.2;1;Pattinson to Bell, 1 run short of a length, opens the face to third man;
13.1;4;Pattinson to Bell, FOUR runs the boundaries keep coming, Bell goes straight down the ground against a full delivery although it was in the air for quite a while but was too straight for mid-on...his bottom hand came into play;
12.6;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run touch quicker and flatter, played off the back foot to midwicket;
12.5;4;Maxwell to Stokes, FOUR runs angled outside leg stump, and Stokes connects with a strong sweep which beats deep square leg;
12.4;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run played back to the bowler;
12.3;?;Maxwell to Stokes, no run onto the front foot, blocked firmly to cover;
12.2;W;Maxwell to Cook, OUT breakthrough! Another start not built on for Cook. Goes for the slog sweep, played over the top of the ball and it hits off stump. Was quite full for the shot. There may have been a little bottom edge. Maxwell does the trick again.;Alastair Cook b Maxwell 44 (53m 43b 8x4 0x6) SR: 102.32;
12.1;?;Maxwell to Cook, no run defended to the off side;
11.6;1;Pattinson to Cook, 1 run full outside off, driven wide of the diving cover but it wasn't really timed so mid-off can get around;
11.5;1;Pattinson to Bell, 1 run pushed into the pads and it's flicked through square leg;
11.4;?;Pattinson to Bell, no run back of a length outside off, Bell watches it go through to the keeper;
11.3;?;Pattinson to Bell, no run this one comes out of the screws as well, full outside off and Bell drives to cover;
11.2;4;Pattinson to Bell, FOUR runs on leg stump and that's a lovely piece of timing and placement by Bell as he flicks it in the air over midwicket;
11.2;1w;Pattinson to Bell, 1 wide now this is fired down the leg side...another wide;
11.1;4;Pattinson to Bell, FOUR runs edged! But just wide of slip as he dived to his right. Full delivery, Bell comes into the drive and gets a thick edge just out of reach of Marsh at the lone slip;
10.6;?;Maxwell to Cook, no run onto the front foot, drives firmly into the ground and to cover;
10.5;1;Maxwell to Bell, 1 run drops short and it's pulled off the front foot through straight midwicket...long-on comes into action;

10.3;?;Maxwell to Cook, no run touch short outside off, Cook back-cuts to short third man;
10.2;1;Maxwell to Bell, 1 run outside leg stump and turned through midwicket;
10.1;?;Maxwell to Bell, no run round the wicket, full and dug out back to the bowler;
9.6;4;Coulter-Nile to Cook, FOUR runs this is straight down the ground, not a common shot for Cook...it didn't come quite of the middle, the bat turned in his hand, but it was straight of mid-off;
9.5;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run gets forward and this takes an inside edge into the pads then rolls to mid-off;
9.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run onto the front foot and drives to cover;
9.3;4;Coulter-Nile to Cook, FOUR runs another short ball, another boundary...Cook pulls fiercely just past a diving square where Christian wasn't miles away from pulling off a blinder;
9.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run this one is cut off the front foot, hard into the ground and fielded by short point;
9.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run full outside off, left alone;
8.6;4;Faulkner to Bell, FOUR runs same again! And this time it's timed much better, launched straight down the ground by Bell as this flying starts continues;
8.5;4;Faulkner to Bell, FOUR runs this is lovely from Bell, comes at the bowler again then drives perfectly straight down the ground in the air...nearly plugs in the outfield again, but dribbles over the rope;
8.4;1;Faulkner to Cook, 1 run finds the outside edge, flies through the area that would be packed during a Test but today is worth a single to third man;
8.3;?;Faulkner to Cook, no run full outside off, gets forward and drives to mid-on;
8.2;1;Faulkner to Bell, 1 run now it's Bell on the pull short as this is dropped short, goes out to deep square;
8.1;?;Faulkner to Bell, no run strangled appeal for lbw, nipped back into Bell but sounded like two noises...might have been two pads but it was high as well;
7.6;4;Coulter-Nile to Cook, FOUR runs three in a row...this time it's a lovely, flowing cover drive. This is a glimpse of the Cook the world game got used to see a while ago. Coulter-Nile tries to compensate by pitching up, but Cook takes a big stride forward and creams it through the off side;
7.5;4;Coulter-Nile to Cook, FOUR runs and again! There's a touch of anger and frustration in this batting from Cook, another poor delivery which was short and wide gets dispatched square of the wicket with the cut;
7.4;4;Coulter-Nile to Cook, FOUR runs that's another strong shot by Cook, this time he cuts against some width from Coulter-Nile and goes over point;
7.4;1w;Coulter-Nile to Cook, 1 wide short ball, outside off stump, Cook goes for the pull but is beaten by the extra bounce and it's too high for the umpires;
7.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run full outside off, 135kph, left alone;
7.2;1;Coulter-Nile to Bell, 1 run touch fuller, Bell drops it into the on side between midwicket and mid-on for a well-judged single;

6.5;4;Faulkner to Cook, FOUR runs excellent stuff from Cook, he came across his stumps and picked this up from a length outside off and pulled it in the air behind square...one bounce over the boundary;
6.4;?;Faulkner to Cook, no run driven firmly to mid-off;
6.3;4;Faulkner to Cook, FOUR runs crunched! This one had the power. Wasn't very short from Faulkner, but Cook latched on, fetching it from outside off and hammering through midwicket. More brute force than timing;
6.2;2;Faulkner to Cook, 2 runs short of a length, Cook pulls again and it doesn't come out of the middle but splits the gap between midwicket and mid-on;
6.2;1w;Faulkner to Cook, 1 wide short, down the leg side but Cook had moved across outside off as he went for the pull. Almost went over leg stump, but called wide;
6.1;?;Faulkner to Cook, no run full at the stumps and worked to midwicket;
5.6;2;Pattinson to Bell, 2 runs over the top again, this time straight down the ground. It has more height than distance, plugging in the outfield about two thirds of the way to the rope. Good intent.;
5.5;4;Pattinson to Bell, FOUR runs he frees his arms square over the off side, this ball swung but it was too wide and meant Bell had room to go up and over point;
5.4;?;Pattinson to Bell, no run back of a length, Bell takes his bottom hand off the bat as he fends it to the leg side;
5.3;?;Pattinson to Bell, no run good delivery, targets Bell's feet and it swings...dug out to the off side;
5.2;?;Pattinson to Bell, no run uses his feet again, gets a thick inside edge into his pads as he aims to drive through the off side;
5.1;?;Pattinson to Bell, no run appeal for caught behind! Bell jabbed at a very full delivery and Wade went up for the catch, but the ball bounced out of the footmarks and Bell hit the ground in his shot;
4.6;?;Johnson to Cook, no run follows up with a full delivery at the toes which is dug out towards mid-on;
4.5;4;Johnson to Cook, FOUR runs this time he makes contact, more width from Johnson and Cook flashes hard getting a healthy top edge over the slips...fully committed to the shot;
4.4;?;Johnson to Cook, no run short and wide, Cook attempts to go up and over point but the ball bounces over his top edge;
4.3;?;Johnson to Cook, no run pushed into the pads again, 145kph, this time Cook doesn't make contact and the ball bobbles to the leg side;
4.2;2;Johnson to Cook, 2 runs angled into the pads, uses his wrists and tucks through midwicket;
4.1;3;Johnson to Bell, 3 runs goes up and over the off side to a length delivery, it easily clears the ring of fielders but then plugs in the outfield;

Fine leg comes up, deep square on the boundary now
 Innings Start
So there you have it - England have avoided what would have been an equal record 10th straight loss across all formats for them. It's their first win of the tour in a full international. Yes, the series is dead, and yes, Australia have rested four of their best players, but at this point England will take anything. It was a strong batting effort that set this up, through Stokes and Buttler especially. Finch's century gave the Australians hope but four wickets to Stokes and five catches to Buttler made sure of the win for England.
With that, Australia's reign at No.1 on the ODI rankings ends after two days. They drop back down to No.2 and India by default return to No.1.
Australia's stand-in captain George Bailey says Australia struggled to control the ball with so many wides and England getting away to a quick start really hurt. "I don't think we've quite nailed down our death bowling yet," Bailey said.
Man of the Match is Ben Stokes. "We batted really well and then I thought we were really consistent and put a lot of pressure on with the ball," Stokes said. "I do love the challenge in every game against Australia, the old foe."
Alastair Cook at last gets to answer some questions about a victory. Relief? "Yeah, it's been a while since we've had this feeling. It's been a frustrating tour and we've played a long way below our potential. The good thing is we know it's there ... when you see the way people have performed today you know we're not a bad side."
That's it from the WACA. What a relief for England to finally get a win on the board. It won't be a record losing streak. It won't be 10-0 or 13-0. Now the question is can they keep it up come Adelaide on Sunday? Join us then for the final match of the ODI series, until then, from Brydon Coverdale and Andrew McGlashan it's goodbye for now.
47.4;W;Bresnan to Pattinson, OUT it's over! England have won! Pattinson skies a high top edge that flies over the head of the keeper, but Buttler is good enough to run back and take a well-judged catch;James Pattinson c ?Buttler b Bresnan 4 (9m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 44.44;
47.3;1;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run worked out towards leg;
47.2;2;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs thumps this out to deep midwicket in the air for a couple more;
47.1;?;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, no run beaten outside off - or is it? Jams down on the ground to a wide one and Hot Spot shows a little tickle on the bat there but England didn't really appeal;
46.6;2;Jordan to Pattinson, 2 runs another one has been skied and another one doesn't get taken in the deep! This one was a top edge that flew out towards deep square leg, the men from deep midwicket and deep fine leg converged but neither quite got there. Ballance from fine leg very nearly made it, but perhaps just misjduged it a touch;
46.5;?;Jordan to Pattinson, no run this one beats the bat through to Buttler;
46.4;1;Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run Jordan tries for the yorker, Coulter-Nile drives down the ground to long-on;

46.3;1w;Jordan to Pattinson, 1 wide bangs it in short now for an above-the-head wide;
46.2;?;Jordan to Pattinson, no run;
46.1;1;Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run is this it? Is this the win? No! Oh dear, Stokes has dropped a chance at deep midwicket! Coulter-Nile has launched this high out into the deep and it was a pretty straightforward chance that just slipped through the fingers of Stokes.;
46.1;1w;Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 wide wrong line for Jordan though as he strays down leg;
45.6;?;Stokes to Pattinson, no run beaten outside off now;
45.5;?;Stokes to Pattinson, no run Pattinson pushes this away to cover for no run;

45.1;?;Stokes to Pattinson, no run steered away towards point;
44.6;W;Broad to Christian, OUT Christian is gone now, yet another batsman in this match caught at third man. He's swung hard and a thickish edge is taken by a sliding Gary Ballance;Dan Christian c Ballance b Broad 23 (48m 19b 1x4 1x6) SR: 121.05;
44.5;4;Broad to Christian, FOUR runs at last Christian does get one out of the middle, he lifts a fuller delivery up and over wide midwicket and this bounces away for a boundary;
44.4;?;Broad to Christian, no run shortish and Christian's swing misses;
44.3;1;Broad to Coulter-Nile, 1 run Coulter-Nile tries to club this over midwicket and his leading edge flies uppishly to third man on the bounce;

44.1;?;Broad to Coulter-Nile, no run Coulter-Nile swings hard now and misses;
43.6;1lb;Stokes to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye Coulter-Nile has to settle for a leg bye as he swings hard;
43.5;1;Stokes to Christian, 1 run Christian backs off and has a swing but again it's not out of the middle, just a thickish inside edge;
43.4;1;Stokes to Coulter-Nile, 1 run swivels a pull around and it's collected on the boundary;
43.3;W;Stokes to Johnson, OUT bowled, middle stump! Johnson went the big swing and Stokes was accurate enough to hit. This is England's match now, it's hard to see any way out for Australia.;Mitchell Johnson b Stokes 6 (9m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 75;
43.3;1w;Stokes to Johnson, 1 wide bonus run now as Stokes skews this one down leg for a wide;

43.1;1;Stokes to Christian, 1 run flicked uppishly off the pads to fine leg for a single;

42.4;4;Broad to Johnson, FOUR runs powerful strike from Johnson now as he gets a low full toss outside off and crunches a drive through cover and through the gap for four;
42.3;?;Broad to Johnson, no run bouncer now and Johnson ducks - this one hasn't been called a wide;
42.2;?;Broad to Johnson, no run too wide for Johnson, who just had the feet planted and didn't move, and good bowling as this is inside the wide guide line;
42.1;?;Broad to Johnson, no run Broad at 135kph and Johnson just steers it away to point;
41.6;1;Stokes to Johnson, 1 run Johnson is keen to after it straight away, backs off a touch and crunches behind point;
41.5;W;Stokes to Faulkner, OUT another wicket and it's the big one! Faulkner will not be the hero today. The extra bounce has done for Faulkner as it did for Maxwell. Faulkner backs off a touch and tries to slash through off and a top edge sails safely through to Buttler;James Faulkner c ?Buttler b Stokes 2 (11m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 18.18;
41.4;1;Stokes to Christian, 1 run shortish but Christian's pull is just for the single to deep square leg;

40.6;?;Broad to Faulkner, no run defended away to the off side;

40.4;1;Broad to Faulkner, 1 run opens the face on this and gets off the mark with a steer to third man;
40.3;?;Broad to Faulkner, no run again Faulkner is happy to defend;

39.6;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run wants a quick single to cover but sends Christian back in the end;
39.5;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run solid in defence from Faulkner as he tries to get his eye in;

39.3;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run pushes away to off;
39.2;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run tight line on off stump and left alone;
39.1;W;Stokes to Maxwell, OUT strikes first ball! An excellent match continues for Stokes. It was a back-of-a-length cutter, gripped a little on the pitch, which Maxwell tried to swing with all his power through the leg side but only got a thin edge to Buttler;Glenn Maxwell c ?Buttler b Stokes 26 (39m 26b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100;
38.6;6;Jordan to Christian, SIX runs stunning strike! Stand and deliver. It was a length ball which Christian sent way over long-on. A lovely shot, nothing like a slog.;
38.5;1;Jordan to Maxwell, 1 run uses his feet, which makes it a very full ball, and drives into the off side but can't quite beat the ring of fielders;
38.4;2;Jordan to Maxwell, 2 runs excellent work on the boundary, a short ball was pulled away and was skipping over the outfield but Root, on as a sub, was very quick around the fine leg rope;
38.3;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run short of a length, he tries to pull but picks out midwicket;
38.2;1lb;Jordan to Christian, 1 leg bye short of a length, takes the thigh pad behind square;
38.1;1;Jordan to Maxwell, 1 run short delivery, Maxwell pulls and gets a healthy top edge down towards third man who does well to keep them to a single;
37.6;?;Bresnan to Christian, no run on off stump, 132kph, blocked back down the pitch;
37.5;1;Bresnan to Maxwell, 1 run fuller and worked into midwicket;
37.5;1w;Bresnan to Maxwell, 1 wide attempted slower-ball bouncer and it gives away another wide down the leg side as Maxwell misses his pull...priceless for Australia. Maxwell, though, was actually beaten by the change of pace;
37.5;1w;Bresnan to Maxwell, 1 wide tries to follow him with a bouncer, but it's too short and is called another wide;
37.4;4;Bresnan to Maxwell, FOUR runs oh, that's a superb shot...full at the stumps and it's flicked backward of square with something appraoching a sweep to vacant fine-leg area;
37.3;1;Bresnan to Christian, 1 run angled into the body, a little fortunate that this isn't glanced either side of short fine-leg but instead picks out the man;
37.2;2;Bresnan to Christian, 2 runs back of a length outside off, well placed as he drives behind point and third man can't cut off the second;
37.2;1w;Bresnan to Christian, 1 wide pushed down the leg side, Bresnan furious with himself...extra run, extra ball;
37.1;1;Bresnan to Maxwell, 1 run goes for the yorker, dug out down to long-on;
36.6;?;Jordan to Christian, no run nicely bowled, 136kph and it tails into Christian who can only push it back to Jordan;
36.5;1;Jordan to Maxwell, 1 run worked off middle and leg down to long leg;
36.4;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run low full toss speared down the leg side but a clip of either bat or pad saves him from a wide call...it was the pad;
36.3;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run ah, then he follows something brilliant with something a bit more ugly as he advances down the pitch and outside leg stump then misses a heave to leg;
36.2;4;Jordan to Maxwell, FOUR runs that's a brilliant piece of placement, as close as Maxwell gets to deft touch as he flicks this delivery off his hip and bisects deep square and long leg perfectly;
36.1;1;Jordan to Christian, 1 run driven in the air but fine of backward point down to third man;
35.6;2;Bresnan to Maxwell, 2 runs short delivery, quickly onto the pull and places it well enough behind square to come back for a second;
35.5;1;Bresnan to Christian, 1 run fuller delivery, inside edge into the pad and it drops into the off side for a sharp single;
35.4;1;Bresnan to Maxwell, 1 run charges down the pitch and lofts this down the ground, one bounce to long-on;
35.3;?;Bresnan to Maxwell, no run angled into the pads, doesn't make contact and it runs back to Bresnan;

35.1;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run good start, tight on off stump, can only defend back to the bowler;

34.5;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run tucked off the stumps to midwicket who is inside the ring but right on the edge;
34.4;?;Jordan to Finch, no run nicely bowled, full on off stump, no room for Finch as he defends;
34.3;1lb;Jordan to Maxwell, 1 leg bye gets a long way across his stumps, England excited for a moment but not really close to a good shout as the ball deflects to square leg;
34.2;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run hint of movement into Maxwell from a full length, pushed to point;
34.1;2;Jordan to Maxwell, 2 runs short of a length, whipped behind square on the leg side and they pick out Tredwell for a second;
33.6;1;Broad to Maxwell, 1 run he ramps this down to third man, carried quite a long way in the air but was never in danger of being caught;
33.5;2;Broad to Maxwell, 2 runs short ball, Maxwell pulls and it doesn't quite come out of the middle so dribbles over the outfield;
33.4;1;Broad to Finch, 1 run pushed into the off side off the back foot;
33.3;?;Broad to Finch, no run short of a length, chopped into the ground and straight to point much to Finch's annoyance;
33.2;2;Broad to Finch, 2 runs pushed into the pads, flicked past a diving midwicket;
33.1;1;Broad to Maxwell, 1 run short of a length at off stump, dropped down by his feet and that's an easy single with the fielders quite deep;

32.5;?;Bopara to Finch, no run very full, almost a yorker, Finch can't get it further than the cover fielder this time;
32.4;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run places it past cover again, out to the sweeper;

31.6;?;Broad to Maxwell, no run well bowled, short of a length, 139kph, targetting Maxwell's body and he fends it to the off side;
31.5;?;Broad to Maxwell, no run full on off stump, comes forward and drives to cover;
31.4;W;Broad to Smith, OUT and that's what he needs! Broad pitches up outside off, just a hint of movement away to take Smith's outside edge. Well bowled, just rolled his fingers across the ball to create some cut;Steven Smith c ?Buttler b Broad 19 (25m 16b 2x4 1x6) SR: 118.75;
31.3;4;Broad to Smith, FOUR runs dispatched! Poor ball, dragged half way down and Smith crunches his pull between midwicket and mid-on. Cook needs better than this from Broad;
31.2;?;Broad to Smith, no run driven into the off side;
31.1;1;Broad to Finch, 1 run full and driven to mid-on;
30.6;4;Bopara to Smith, FOUR runs wrong line, outside leg stump and that's gift as he tucks it away fine past short fine-leg;

30.4;?;Bopara to Finch, no run dug out to the off side;
30.3;2;Bopara to Finch, 2 runs and there it is, tucks a brace into the leg side for his second hundred of the series. Superb innings;
30.2;1;Bopara to Smith, 1 run worked down the ground, nearly off a leading edge;
30.1;1;Bopara to Finch, 1 run driven firmly to cover who parries it for a single;
29.6;6;Stokes to Smith, SIX runs Smith clears the boundary now! He got a bit of a short one and just went after it, a pull that flew low and flat and only just out of the reach of the man at deep midwicket;
29.5;1;Stokes to Finch, 1 run swivels this off the hips and down to fine leg;
29.4;2;Stokes to Finch, 2 runs uppishly driven through cover - that was heart-in-mouth stuff as this flew just wide of the man at short cover and away for a couple more;
29.4;1w;Stokes to Finch, 1 wide a bonus run for Australia now as Stokes strays down leg;
29.3;1;Stokes to Smith, 1 run clipped away through midwicket and Smith can only get a single;
29.2;?;Stokes to Smith, no run Smith defends away to leg;
29.1;1;Stokes to Finch, 1 run driven down towards mid-on and Finch moves up to 94;
28.6;?;Jordan to Smith, no run Smith drives but can't beat short cover;
28.5;?;Jordan to Smith, no run Smith goes the power pull but it turns into a bottom edge into his leg;
28.4;?;Jordan to Smith, no run and slip is in play in the 29th over of the chase! But it hasn't carried! Smith drives really hard outside off and this edge just dies a bit on Cook and bounces short of him.;
28.3;?;Jordan to Smith, no run defended away to the off side;
28.2;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run very quick stuff from Smith to hurry through for a single here as Finch nudges to the off side - Morgan was sharp off the mark but Smith was fast enough to get through for the one;
28.1;2;Jordan to Finch, 2 runs worked away through leg side now;
27.6;1;Stokes to Finch, 1 run Finch enters the 90s now with a push and quick single to leg;
27.6;1w;Stokes to Finch, 1 wide shorter and down leg - Finch can't get bat on ball and that's a wide;

27.4;1;Stokes to Finch, 1 run nudged away for another single to midwicket;
27.3;1;Stokes to Smith, 1 run Smith now picks up a single by driving the fullish Stokes length wide of mid-on;
27.2;1;Stokes to Finch, 1 run shorter now and Finch just works a single to square leg;
27.1;?;Stokes to Finch, no run Stokes keeps up with the fullish length and Finch's drive can't beat mid-on;
26.6;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run on the back foot now Finch nudges a single through wide mid-on and keeps the strike;
26.5;?;Jordan to Finch, no run a touch of inswing now from Jordan, Finch punches it into the turf and back to Jordan;
26.4;1;Jordan to Smith, 1 run gets off the mark now with an edge sort of nudge off bat and leg behind square;

26.2;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run waits on this now and cuts away towards third man;
26.1;4;Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs well, the loss of a partner hasn't worried Aaron Finch at all, he has just driven this magnificently through extra cover. Such great placement there, and this is all the way along the ground for four;
25.6;W;Stokes to Bailey, OUT down leg side and this flicks something on the way through to Buttler. It sounded thuddy as if it was pad, and the caught-behind appeal is turned down. England want a review. Well, this is very interesting. The front-on view didn't seem to support the review but Hot Spot has shown something. A clear mark on Hot Spot from the side on camera and this is out! What a good review - the sound didn't seem like bat, but Hot Spot said it was off the face of the bat before the pad. After the umpires also double-check that the ball has carried, Bailey has been given out!;George Bailey c ?Buttler b Stokes 11 (22m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 73.33;
25.5;1;Stokes to Finch, 1 run Stokes strays on to the pads but it only costs a single as Finch flicks it to fine leg;
25.4;?;Stokes to Finch, no run Finch pushes away to the off side for no run;
25.3;1;Stokes to Bailey, 1 run now it's Bailey using the single-to-third-man option, just steering it off the face of the bat;
25.2;1;Stokes to Finch, 1 run Stokes goes fullish and Finch drives straight back past the bowler for a single;
25.1;?;Stokes to Finch, no run driven down to mid-on;

24.5;1;Bopara to Finch, 1 run another dab to third man from Finch;
24.4;1;Bopara to Bailey, 1 run pushed back towards the bowler and a slight fumble from Bopara allows them to get through for a single;
24.3;4;Bopara to Bailey, FOUR runs that's some muscle from Bailey, gets a fullish ball on the stumps from Bopara and clears the front leg to thump that down the ground past the bowler for four;
24.2;1;Bopara to Finch, 1 run another run to third man, Finch and Bailey seem happy to turn the strike over with singles where possible;
24.1;1;Bopara to Bailey, 1 run Bailey crunches the ball down into the ground and takes off for a single down to third man;
23.6;1;Stokes to Bailey, 1 run Bailey plays back and just nudges a single through midwicket;
23.6;1w;Stokes to Bailey, 1 wide bouncer again and this one will be called a wide, it was down leg as well as too high;
23.5;?;Stokes to Bailey, no run bouncer now and Bailey goes the hook and then sort of drags the bat away;
23.4;?;Stokes to Bailey, no run Bailey plays back and gets struck on the pad, only the hint of an lbw shout from Stokes. It was probably a touch high, but was certainly accurate;
23.3;1;Stokes to Finch, 1 run shortish and steered uppishly towards third man on the bounce;
23.2;?;Stokes to Finch, no run Finch takes off for a couple of runs here - and doesn't get any. Off his body and he wants a quick leg bye but Stokes is quickly on to it, sends him back with a throw that hits the stumps. Then Finch wants an overthrow on the ricochet, but gets sent back by Bailey. A lot of work for no runs;
23.1;?;Stokes to Finch, no run punchy drive from Finch into the ground but can't beat cover;
22.6;2;Bopara to Bailey, 2 runs on the pads now and Bailey just places this nicely through square leg and hares back for two;
22.5;1;Bopara to Finch, 1 run Finch again drives just wide of cover and picks up a single this time;
22.4;?;Bopara to Finch, no run defended away towards cover;
22.3;1;Bopara to Bailey, 1 run fullish from Bopara and Bailey gets off the mark with a drive just wide of cover;

21.1;?;Stokes to Finch, no run fullish on the stumps and driven to mid-off;
20.6;?;Bopara to Bailey, no run straight bat from Bailey as he defends;
20.5;?;Bopara to Bailey, no run driven down to mid-on;
20.4;W;Bopara to Wade, OUT oh dear, Wade has tried to force the pace now with a drive over long-off but all he's managed to do was find Cook in the ring;Matthew Wade c Cook b Bopara 23 (51m 42b 1x4 0x6) SR: 54.76;
20.3;?;Bopara to Wade, no run Wade tries to steer a single to point but Finch sends him back;
20.2;?;Bopara to Wade, no run again defended away to off;
20.1;?;Bopara to Wade, no run defended back towards the bowler;
19.6;?;Tredwell to Finch, no run Finch on the back foot punches to the bowler;
19.5;6;Tredwell to Finch, SIX runs well, Finch is still seeing it pretty well! He's clubbed Tredwell over long-on for six more, clean hitting this;
19.4;6;Tredwell to Finch, SIX runs this time Finch backs off a touch and instead of going through off he lifts it high and long over long-on, that was six from the moment it left the bat. It's landed on the roof of one of the stands - so we'll have a delay as they find a new ball;
19.3;?;Tredwell to Finch, no run Finch tries to create something now by backing away but Tredwell followed him, now he crunches to cover and can't find the gap;
19.2;1;Tredwell to Wade, 1 run much the same again now as Wade nudges a single down to long-off;
19.1;1;Tredwell to Finch, 1 run Finch advances to Tredwell and drives a single down to long-on;
18.6;?;Bopara to Wade, no run Wade again mistimes it, he just can't quite get going now, and this clunks into the ground in front of him;

18.1;?;Bopara to Wade, no run Wade tries the big swipe through leg but mistimes it;
17.6;1;Tredwell to Wade, 1 run Wade gets this one down along the ground past the bowler but long-on manages to cut it off;
17.5;?;Tredwell to Wade, no run goes back into his crease now and cuts but can't beat backward point;
17.4;?;Tredwell to Wade, no run Wade dances down the pitch and this skews off the thickish edge away to backward point;
17.3;1;Tredwell to Finch, 1 run around the wicket still to Finch, who clips it away to midwicket;
17.2;1;Tredwell to Wade, 1 run uses the feet now and drives a single down the ground to long-on;
17.1;?;Tredwell to Wade, no run Tredwell sneaks in with his economical action and Wade pushes to off;
16.6;6;Bresnan to Finch, SIX runs Finch goes down the ground and that's high, high, high - if he'd played that in the BBL at Etihad Stadium it might have hit the roof - and he has got enough on it to clear the boundary;
16.5;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run slower delivery at 107kph and Finch watchfully defends it;
16.4;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run Finch defends to off from the back foot;
16.3;1;Bresnan to Wade, 1 run on the pads now and Wade clips a run away through square leg;

15.3;?;Tredwell to Wade, no run Wade goes across his stumps and defends to leg;
15.2;1;Tredwell to Finch, 1 run Finch uses the feet and tries to go over the top but this just chips out on the bounce to the sweeper at midwicket;
15.1;?;Tredwell to Finch, no run Finch defends Tredwell back down the pitch;
14.6;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run handsome drive, on the up, but it picks out cover;
14.5;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run chopped in the ground and it bobbles back towards the slips, was aiming to guide to third man but was cramped for room;
14.4;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-off;

12.4;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run on middle and leg, aims to work through midwicket but can't find the gap;
12.3;1;Bresnan to Finch, 1 run short of a length, that's well run as it's defended towards mid-on who is giving away the single;
12.2;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run from one extreme to the other, this is left alone outside off;
12.1;6;Bresnan to Finch, SIX runs terrific shot! Finch breaks the shackles with a free swing of the arms to a full delivery, launching it straight down the ground over the sightscreen;
11.6;?;Tredwell to Wade, no run a chance to the left hander, it's on off stump and defended on the back foot...tidy start from Tredwell;

10.4;1;Bresnan to Wade, 1 run defended with soft hands behind square, second slip has to run around to field;
10.3;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run goes for the hook, there's an appeal for a catch by the keeper but it's a quick 'not out'. Was a bit late on the shot;
10.2;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run a fuller delivery, Wade walks into his defensive push to cover;
10.1;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run on off stump, defended to backward point;
9.6;?;Broad to Finch, no run left alone outside off;
9.5;?;Broad to Finch, no run fuller this time, outside off, Finch hanging back a little but defends easily enough to cover;
9.4;4;Broad to Finch, FOUR runs finds the gap this time, just enough room for him to free his arms into a back-foot drive which beats a diving backward point;
9.3;?;Broad to Finch, no run gets on his toes and punches this shortish delivery off the back foot to mid-off;
9.2;?;Broad to Finch, no run another one past off stump, this time just at waist-height to the keeper;

8.6;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run short of a length at off stump, defended into the covers. Tight from Bresnan.;
8.5;2;Bresnan to Wade, 2 runs a fraction fuller this time, he opens the face and runs it backward of point but also wide enough of third man for a second;

8.2;1;Bresnan to Finch, 1 run flicked in the air in front of square;

7.5;1;Broad to Finch, 1 run back-cuts down to third man;
7.4;?;Broad to Finch, no run a touch fuller and wider, Finch opts to leave it alone although I'm sure he was tempted to throw the kitchen sink at it;

7.2;?;Broad to Finch, no run short of a length outside off, climbs nicely through to Buttler as Finch lets it go;

6.6;1;Bresnan to Wade, 1 run on leg stump, glanced away down to long leg so he's off the mark straight away;
6.5;W;Bresnan to Marsh, OUT top catch! Marsh trying to guide this delivery down to third man, was a little close to him and the thick outside edge is grabbed by Bell diving high to his left at second slip. A good start from Bresnan is rewarded;Shaun Marsh c Bell b Bresnan 15 (31m 17b 2x4 0x6) SR: 88.23;
6.4;?;Bresnan to Marsh, no run good delivery, nips away off the seam and beats Marsh's outside edge;

6.1;?;Bresnan to Marsh, no run full at off stump, defended to mid-off;
5.6;1;Broad to Marsh, 1 run better ball, full on off stump, but excellent batting as Marsh drops it into the off side and is quickly called through;

5.4;?;Broad to Finch, no run now he escapes a short and wide delivery which is cut within the stopping range of Morgan at point;
5.3;?;Broad to Finch, no run pulls the length back and it's defended to cover;
5.2;4;Broad to Finch, FOUR runs now he gets too full, although to be fair it's a wonderful cover drive from Finch. Everything was perfect as he just leant into the shot and placed it between cover and mid-off;
5.1;?;Broad to Finch, no run outside off, left alone;
4.6;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run full again and he steals a single to mid-on who is hanging quite deep;
4.5;?;Jordan to Finch, no run full at off stump and driven firmly back at the bowler...his run-up then did not look smooth at all. He delivered from miles behind the crease. That's not good;
4.4;?;Jordan to Finch, no run good delivery, finds that length that leaves the batsman in two minds...left alone by Finch;
4.3;4;Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs oh dear, now mid-on has let one through his legs. Tredwell the culprit. It was a well-struck on-drive, powerful from Finch, and it bobbled a bit but should have been stopped;
4.2;?;Jordan to Finch, no run better length outside off, not too full, left alone;
4.1;2;Jordan to Finch, 2 runs goes for the pull, gets just enough bat on it to evade midwicket;
3.6;?;Broad to Marsh, no run on off stump, defended to the leg side;
3.5;1;Broad to Finch, 1 run full and straighter, Finch drives and is a little stuck in the crease this time, the ball takes a thick inside edge to long leg;
3.4;4;Broad to Finch, FOUR runs blimey, that's a powerful stroke...hint of width from Broad and Finch rifled it behind point with a lovely cut shot;
3.3;?;Broad to Finch, no run big appeal for lbw, a full delivery which Finch plays across, but it was always heading towards the leg side. Cook, who is back on the field, quickly forgets a review;
3.2;?;Broad to Finch, no run full at off stump, driven very sweetly but straight to mid-off...came into the stroke nicely rather than hanging back which is when it goes in the air;
3.1;1;Broad to Marsh, 1 run squared up a touch by a delivery on off stump, takes a thick outside edge to third man;
2.6;?;Jordan to Finch, no run gets away with some width this time as Finch cuts straight to Morgan at point;
2.5;1;Jordan to Marsh, 1 run too full on the pads, doesn't quite adjust to the left hander, flicked down to long leg;
2.4;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run back of a length, runs off the thick outer part of the bat behind point;
2.3;?;Jordan to Finch, no run drags the length back, that's better, and it shapes back into Finch as he shoulders arms;
2.2;4;Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs and again, this is a better shot as he stands tall and drives strongly square of the wicket through point;
2.1;4;Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs that's a floaty wide delivery and Finch pounces on it with a strong cover drive...Australia up and running;
1.6;4;Broad to Marsh, FOUR runs that's lovely placement from Marsh as he guides this delivery, with complete control, wide of second slip and fine of third man;
1.5;?;Broad to Marsh, no run that's more like it, some effort as he hits a good length and it nips past the outside edge;
1.4;2;Broad to Marsh, 2 runs full and very wide, Marsh reaches for it and drives between the two men in the point area;
1.3;?;Broad to Marsh, no run gets onto off stump, defended towards point;
1.2;4;Broad to Marsh, FOUR runs wrong line again, on the pads, and this time it's clipped away with the timing to reach the boundary...poor start from Broad;
1.1;2;Broad to Marsh, 2 runs nicely turned away off the pads through square leg;
0.6;?;Jordan to Finch, no run well bowled, nips back off a length and beats Finch taking the top of the pad through to Buttler;
0.5;?;Jordan to Finch, no run left alone outside off;
0.4;4;Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs well, that was in the air but over cover rather than mid-off...wasn't a half volley, he just strode into the ball and lifted it on the up over the off-side ring;
0.3;?;Jordan to Finch, no run back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-off (who needs to be ready for a catch with Finch on strike);
0.2;1lb;Jordan to Marsh, 1 leg bye takes the thigh pad into the leg side;
0.1;?;Jordan to Marsh, no run short of a length, going across Marsh outside off, left alone;
