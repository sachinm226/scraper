Data
That's a typically confident declaration, 8 for 442 and more than 20 overs left in the day. It's also a jutted jaw in the direction of Joe Root, who chose to put Australia in yesterday. England need to summon something in response (maybe a Balrog?) if this isn't going to be repeatedly mentioned to the (former) captain in 20 years time...
They'll be out there batting in 10 minutes. While we wait, please, speak your brains:
Andrew Jennings: "Englands management need to stop messing about with the Stokes issue, and bring him back for the third test, and also give Crane his chance. Ali and Woakes have been very disappointing"
Mustafa Moudi: "England's Bowling Report Card So Far: 3 Innings, 943 Runs, 18 Wickets with an Average of 52.39 and S/R of 109.83 !!"
Gary: "So Overton went for just over a ton!"
Andrew: "Seeing those "7 last overseas tests" stats make me wonder what the English statisticians look at when advising Root to bowl first "

147.3;?;Overton to Lyon, no run more short stuff, swing and a miss this time;

It'll be Stuart Broad from the City End
 Innings Start
England wrapped up for 227, Craig Overton left on 41 not out... And the sight of David Warner and Cameron Bancroft sprinting from the field confirms that Australia will be batting again with a lead of 215. England have avoided the follow on but they look unlikely to avoid a thumping in Adelaide. We'll be back in a few minutes
"Bowl them out for 100 and we have a faint chance," mooches Matt. "Any more and series is gone."
76.1;W;Lyon to Anderson, OUT tossed up and Anderson is hit on the front leg trying to sweep - given! He reviews, which he might as well, hoping it's missing leg. But he hopes in vain, Hawk-Eye showing it to be smacking leg stump in the mush;James Anderson lbw b Lyon 0 (8m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

74.4;W;Lyon to Broad, OUT turn and bounce, takes the edge!

73.3;?;Cummins to Broad, no run short ball, taken by the leaping Bancroft at short leg... was there any bat on it? Superb catch diving to his left, but it was off the body;

68.1;?;Lyon to Overton, no run forward and blocked;

66.3;?;Lyon to Overton, no run patted back down the pitch;
66.2;1;Lyon to Woakes, 1 run flipped to leg with an urgent whirlwind of the arms;
66.1;?;Lyon to Woakes, no run over the wicket, appreciable turn and a bit of a flat-footed back-foot block from Woakes, who isn't keen on over-committing;
65.6;?;Starc to Overton, no run that's an absolute pearler. Left-arm line from over the wicket, pitching on off, drawing the stroke, holding its line, and somehow failing to snick the edge through to the keeper. Can't do much with those;

63.5;4;Starc to Woakes, FOUR runs short, sharp, spliced, safe. Woakes was looking to punch that through point but it kept getting bigger on him. No matter, it's a boundary and the 50 stand;
63.4;2;Starc to Woakes, 2 runs back of a length, and that's a solid punch through the gap in the covers. A sensible stand brewing between these two;
63.3;?;Starc to Woakes, no run round the wicket, solidly blocked on middle stump. Starc swoops in his followthrough;
63.2;?;Starc to Woakes, no run blocked back down the pitch from a fuller length again;

62.1;4;Hazlewood to Woakes, FOUR runs width and walloped! Calypso-style, to boot, down on one knee, flashing the blade, and clean through point. Top boshing;
61.6;?;Cummins to Overton, no run short and sharp, but Overton is equal to the task, dropping the ball at his feet like Obama dropping the mic. Without anything resembling the context of a job done, of course;
61.5;?;Cummins to Overton, no run back of a length once more, punched out to the off side;
61.4;?;Cummins to Overton, no run tentatively forward to defend;
61.3;?;Cummins to Overton, no run another well-directed bouncer, but Overton won't be drawn;

61.1;?;Cummins to Overton, no run tight line, back of a length, blocked into the off side;
60.6;3;Hazlewood to Overton, 3 runs much fuller, and that was the one that Woakes was waiting for, a calm punch to mid-on, and this is now the best partnership of the innings. Sound the *fightback-starts-here* klaxon!;
60.5;1;Hazlewood to Woakes, 1 run attacking the ribs once again, Woakes is living dangerously with that fenced defence to leg;
60.4;?;Hazlewood to Woakes, no run angled defence into the off side;
60.3;1lb;Hazlewood to Overton, 1 leg bye fired into the pads, tucked round the corner;
60.2;1;Hazlewood to Woakes, 1 run flipped off the hip ... in the air .... but short of deep backward square. A calculated risk. Sort of;

59.6;?;Cummins to Overton, no run fired in at the body and tapped away;
59.5;1;Cummins to Woakes, 1 run yikes, spooned over short leg! Cummins goes over the wicket, bangs in a cobra of a bumper, it homes in on Woakes who somehow manages to get it up and over the man in close;
59.4;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run short again and Woakes takes the bottom hand off as he steers it away to leg;
59.3;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run thud, thud, thud - that's the sound of England the middle of the pitch taking a beating. Woakes ducks;
59.2;1;Cummins to Overton, 1 run COverton shuffles across and flicks a single off his hip to get off strike;
59.2;1w;Cummins to Overton, 1 wide very short, more of a danger to airplanes flying over Adelaide, called wide on height;

58.6;1;Hazlewood to Overton, 1 run short and at the body but shovelled away behind square for a single;
58.5;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run more chin music - or, more accurately, top-of-the-block music - flying through a matter of millimetres from Overton's helmet as he jumps and ducks at the same time;

58.1;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run over the wicket, short and rising but again well dealt with;
57.6;2;Cummins to Woakes, 2 runs short ball (natch), Woakes pulls with something approaching confidence, between the two men in the deep but Hazlewood again does well to prevent a boundary;

57.4;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run Woakes jumps back and across to defend;
57.3;1;Cummins to Overton, 1 run short ball, swung away powerfully down towards fine leg, Hazlewood has to run around to his left but does brilliantly to reel the ball in one handed as it bounced beyond the rope, dragging it back to prevent four;
57.2;?;Cummins to Overton, no run banged in, rising like the Kraken from the deep, Overton fends it in front of short leg, where Bancroft snaffles it and then underarms on to the stumps - but the bat was grounded;
57.1;1;Cummins to Woakes, 1 run short and Woakes rides it to steer one away square of the wicket;
56.6;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run banged in, 141kph and it's another beast of a ball to deal with, Overton manages to ride the bounce and drop it to earth;
56.5;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run oof, a genuine throat ball, Overton coming across and he has to take evasive action;
56.4;4;Hazlewood to Overton, FOUR runs short and wide and slapped through backward point, kept the ball down and there's no one out there to prevent four;
56.3;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run short, peppering the body, this nips back inside the bat and hits him on the thigh pad;

56.1;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run back of a length, straightening a touch as Overton prods it away from the crease;
55.6;4;Starc to Woakes, FOUR runs short and flung wide this time and Woakes responds with a meaty swipe through cover point to pick up four - and take England past 150 in the process. Small victories;
55.5;?;Starc to Woakes, no run rapid bouncer, horrible for the batsman to deal with, Woakes leaps for his life and manages to block it safely down in front of his feet;
55.4;1;Starc to Overton, 1 run short and rising towards the body, 144kph as Overton jabs it away, just past Shaun Marsh at short leg!;

54.6;?;Lyon to Overton, no run full on the stumps and turned to the leg side;
54.5;3;Lyon to Woakes, 3 runs Woakes comes forward but is suckered by the ball going on, a thick edge runs wide of the slips and they run well for three;

53.1;W;Starc to Bairstow, OUT pitched up and driven in the air, Starc sticks out a hand... and juggles the rebound to complete the catch! Everything they touch turns to green-and-gold today! Bairstow departs now, staring at the heavens as England slide into Ashes hell.

51.5;?;Starc to Woakes, no run done him again, short enough to leave but there's not much room for clear thinking in these circumstances as Woakes flirts with it and the ball shoots through;
51.4;?;Starc to Woakes, no run through him, fiendish line and the extra bounce as the ball leaves Woakes has him poking at thin air;
51.3;?;Starc to Woakes, no run over the wicket to Woakes, slanted across him as the batsman hangs back;

48.2;W;Lyon to Ali, OUT flight and dip, it's chipped back in the air, waaaaaaaaayyyy to the left of the bowler... only for Lyon to pluck a one-handed screamer! Holy smokes! That's not nice, Garry, it's sensational! Slightly loose from Moeen, done by the ball dropping on him, but the connection was firm and it brought out the Superman in Lyon as he soared to his left and grabbed it with the surety that characterises everything Australia do right now;Moeen Ali c & b Lyon 25 (79m 57b 2x4 0x6) SR: 43.85;
48.1;2;Lyon to Ali, 2 runs dances down, bit of a woolly woof from Moeen, thickish outside edge as drives over cover but it lands safely;
