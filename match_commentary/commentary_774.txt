Match State: Day 1 start scheduled for 10.30am Local Time (09.30 GMT)
Hello and welcome to the start of the fourth Ashes Test
I'm Anand Vasu, and will be your commentator for this game. It has been tremendously enjoyable calling the action for the first three Tests and one can only hope this turns out to be a cracker as well
Let's cut to the chase and give you all the news as it has come in
England have won the toss and chosen to bat
But the news for Austgralia is not so good. Glenn McGrath has been ruled out and Michael Kasprowicz takes his place
Jason Gillespie, who has struggled for form all summer has been left out, and Shaun Tait, the young tearaway from South Australia gets his Test debut
The weather forecasts have been a bit iffy for the next few days
There's rain in the area and we expect interruptions in the form of showers
With the series standing at 1-1 there's everything to play for here. The Ashes could well be decided on how the day's play goes
There's been plenty of excitement surrounding Shaun Tait, who is reputed to regularly clock in excess of 90 mph
The players are all on the field now and onm place
The umpire calls "Play!"
Here we go, it's Lee to Trescothick
 Innings Start
End of the Australian innings. Entertainment from Lee but in the End Australia all out for just 218
Will England enforce the follow-on? That is the question.
It's been cracking cricket so far today. Do send any feedback to http://www.cricinfo.com/commentary.html
News has just come in that England have indeed enforced the follow-on.
This leaves Australia 259 behind
We'll take a short break and be back with all the action shortly

The light is offered and the batsmen gladly accept and walk off the field
But since this is after the scheduled close, which was about 11 minutes ago, there will be no resumption
That is stumps on the third day
