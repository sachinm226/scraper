1.05pm: That's a quite remarkable comeback from West Indies, after toiling for so long in the heat of the Hussey-Bailey axis.They claimed the first three wickets for 58 and the last seven for 50 - but the filling in Australia's sandwich was pretty meaty. Have the hosts' bowlers done enough for the batsmen to win it? Find out with me and George in about half an hour ...
49.5;W;Narine to Christian, OUT Christian is given out lbw - but he calls for the review. It hit the batsman full on the toe, in front of leg stump. Christian was hoping it was sliding down leg ... but it didn't have far to go and the replays suggest the ball would have thunked into the stump.

47.4;W;Narine to McKay, OUT McKay falls to the doosra! Australia are floundering like Andrew Flintoff in a pedalo!

There's definitely a bit of spice to proceedings today ...
 Innings Start
5.30 pm West Indies were out of this contest having lost five wickets for very little but they've fought back admirably. They couldn't quite get over the line though, so the series remains 1-1 with two to play.
Shane Watson at the post-match presentation. He says Australia were hoping to get 240, and the batting is an area they want to improve on. He says it's an odd feeling at the end, because his team was ahead of West Indies for most of the chase. "It's a big learning experience, captaining in a game that is so tight. We need to adapt and get better in these conditions."
Michael Hussey is the Man of the Match for his innings of 67. This pitch was not easy to bat on, big turn and bounce for the spinners, so they were tough runs. Hussey says he feels as though Australia should have won but is relieved to have held on for the tie.
Sammy: "We believed we could beat them. We should have won today .. it shows the belief of the team." He says they were looking to run in the final over but the ball went straight to the fielder. "I won't put the blame on anybody ..."
Kushal: "I just felt a pang in my heart. Memories of Klusener/Donald in THAT semifinal."
That's all we have for you today. The fourth game is on Friday in St Lucia, let's hope it's just as good. Thank you for all your emails. Cheers.
49.4;W;Lee to Sammy, OUT Oh Roach, what have you done? After batting with such composure, with West Indies on the verge of victory, Roach sets off for a non-existent single after Sammy had played the ball towards point. Actually Sammy had begun to run as well and then stopped, looking in desperation as Roach continued towards and past him. Sammy was stranded mid-pitch as the fielder at point threw the ball to Lee, who broke the stumps to tie the game. Lee was never going to muck that up. Australia have held their nerve to pull this off;Daren Sammy run out (Bailey/Lee) 10 (37m 14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 71.42;

48.1;4;Doherty to Roach, FOUR runs that's fired down leg side and Roach sweeps, I think he got some bat on that and the ball races towards fine leg.

13.3;?;Watson to Bravo, no run defended on the front foot towards the off side;
13.2;W;Watson to Samuels, OUT that looks plumb lbw and the umpire agrees. Samuels is on his way, he's decided not to review. Watson pitched full and straight, Samuels defended from his crease, as he usually does. He missed and was hit around the knee roll on the back pad. Absolutely plumb. That held its line instead of angling into the right-hander;Marlon Samuels lbw b Watson 2 (25m 20b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10;

8.3;?;Doherty to Samuels, no run left alone outside off stump;
8.2;?;Doherty to Samuels, no run huge appeal for lbw, Kumar Dharmasena says not out and Australia want the decision reviewed.
