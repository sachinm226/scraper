Wow, that was pretty breathless stuff, Australia racking up 341 for 8 from their 50 overs, with two quick fifties from Ronchi (22 balls) and David Hussey (19) the highlight. This is their highest total against West Indies for Australia and now the home side will need to have all their batting mettle about them.

2.1;?;Edwards to Watson, no run some width outside off, driven straight to the man at cover;
1.6;4;Powell to Marsh, FOUR runs short and cut hard off the back foot through point. The shot was there for the making;
1.5;?;Powell to Marsh, no run stifled appeal but the batsman had got some bat on to it as he tried to squeeze to square - the ball also pitched outside leg;
1.4;?;Powell to Marsh, no run hustles up to him now, the ball slanting across him and the batsman shapes to cut but it goes through;
1.3;4;Powell to Marsh, FOUR runs gets hold of the pull this time! Just a fraction short from Powell and Marsh is so quick to tranfer his weight and send it fairly aerial - deliberately - and straight through square;
1.2;?;Powell to Marsh, no run shortish ball on off, coming across him, the batsman caught in two minds shaping initially for the pull and ends up stopping on the shot;
1.1;1;Powell to Watson, 1 run some movement off the seam back in to the right hander, Powell generating plenty of awkward bounce. In the end it's tucked down off the hips in line with off;
0.6;?;Edwards to Marsh, no run on off stump, defended on the front foot into the covers with a slight push and they decide not to run;
0.5;?;Edwards to Marsh, no run fired again across him, flatter this time, left alone;
0.4;?;Edwards to Marsh, no run again some good pace and carry off the deck, it's left as it comes in on a good length;
0.3;?;Edwards to Marsh, no run good ball, some decent carry and at 85.2mph, nips away off the seam after pitching on a good length and the batsman quickly draws his bat in;
0.2;1;Edwards to Watson, 1 run bangs in short, some swing away, Watson squares behind it, the outside edge not carrying to second slip, bouncing just in front. Some immediate encouragement for West Indies and Edwards, however;
0.1;1;Edwards to Marsh, 1 run stays over the wicket to the left hander who squeezes a full and swinging delivery out to square and they're off the mark immediately;

9.25am Australia have won the toss and will bat.
Australia are, as mentioned, unchanged. For West Indies, Andre Fletcher comes in for Darren Sammy.
West Indies 1 Chris Gayle (capt), 2 Xavier Marshall, 3 Ramnaresh Sarwan, 4 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 5 Dwayne Bravo, 6 Shawn Findlay, 7 Denesh Ramdin (wk), 8 Andre Fletcher, 9 Daren Powell, 10 Fidel Edwards, 11 Nikita Miller.
9.15am A hearty good morning to you and thanks for tuning in to coverage of the fifth and final ODI between West Indies and Australia. We know that Australia are 4-0 up and hope to be heading for a whitewash after West Indies passed up the chance to claw one back in the last one-day here on Friday. Michael Clarke will captain the side as Ricky Ponting has flown home to have some attention on his injured wrist. Australia, we understand, will field the same side as the last match.
So, barring any late injuries they should line up like this: Australia 1 Shane Watson, 2 Shaun Marsh, 3 David Hussey, 4 Michael Clarke (capt), 5 Michael Hussey, 6 Andrew Symonds, 7 Luke Ronchi (wk), 8 James Hopes, 9 Brett Lee 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Nathan Bracken. Stuart Clark, then, is the only player not to have featured in the one-day series, so he can put his feet up yet again.
No news from the West Indies camp yet, nor of the toss. As ever we will keep you informed, we being myself Jenny Roesler and himself Brydon Coverdale, hello.
 Innings Start
Johnson finishes with a five-for, his second in ODIs, as Australia complete a 5-0 whitewash, only the third time that's happened to West Indies on home soil. And the sealing win was emphatic - by 169 runs.
Check out Brydon Coverdale's bulletin for a comprehensive summary of the day's action (shoud save you reading back through the text commentary, at least).
The presentation now. Here's Chris Gayle, who gets some cheers and applause. How much did Friday's match take out of the team? "First of all, congratulations to Clarkey and Australia for winning. Yes, Friday, a close loss can affect you mentally.
"We need to work on our mental aspect of the game [as well as the physical side]," he admits. "Nikita Miller bowled very well, Shawn Findlay batted really well."
Now Michael Clarke, the winning captain. "Full credit goes to the whole Australian team. Our goal was to come over to the Caribbean and win 5-0 in the one-day series and we've done that.
"It's great for Australian cricket. We have a lot of depth back at home," he says, with a nod to those replacement players - such as Luke Ronchi - who have stepped in and stepped up well.
"I think I achieved what the captain asked. He wanted us to come home having won 5-0," Clarke says of Ricky Ponting, who has already flown home to have treatment on his wrist. And if they had have lost? "I don't think he would have let me back in the country!"
The Man of the Match is Ronchi for his fast fifty. "It's good fun. It's the way I play cricket at home, that was the job I was given today - to go and make the most of the Powerplays." And the ground? "It's a lot like the WACA - short and straight - and Dave Huss did much the same. Hads it still the No 1, if I get to tour again it would be fantastic, but I will just have to see what happens."
The Player of the Series is Shane Watson, not bad given that he wasn't in the squad originally. "It's a lot of fun. Just to be here initially was a bit of a shock. I've had a lot of fun, here. To be back in the Australian group has been a lot of fun." Guess he's had a lot of fun. "Like anything you've got to make the most of the opportunities you do get. Everything's going great. It's been a pretty amazing three or four months now. It's been a lot of fun."
So then, Australia have won the series convincingly. They weren't always at their best, but in some ways they didn't have to be. West Indies have a lot of thinking and a lot of work to be done in the next few months prior to the Champions Trophy in Pakistan in September. They head to Canada next while Australia return home for their next commitments which will be the Top End series against Bangladesh beginning late August.
Many thanks for joining us throughout Australia's entire tour of the Caribbean and we look forward to bringing you some more cricket soon. Don't forget to join us for England's Test series against South Africa which kicks off at Lord's this week. Until next time, it's goodbye from me Jenny Roesler and Brydon Coverdale.

7.1;4;Johnson to Chanderpaul, FOUR runs well struck, this one is on the stumps and a half-volley, Chanderpaul simply lifts this one over midwicket and with the field up that's two bounces over the boundary;
6.6;?;Lee to Marshall, no run outside off, Marshall defends;
6.5;1;Lee to Chanderpaul, 1 run doesn't quite get this one right as he attempts to repeat the shot, a thick inside egde races past the stumps;
6.4;4;Lee to Chanderpaul, FOUR runs excellent shot, Chanderpaul drives this one sweetly through the vacant cover region for four;
6.3;?;Lee to Chanderpaul, no run good ball, fuller length and nipping back in to the left-hander, Chanderpaul good enough to defend;
6.2;?;Lee to Chanderpaul, no run Chanderpaul looks to cut this one, it beats the bat;
6.1;4;Lee to Chanderpaul, FOUR runs short and on leg, Chanderpaul hooks and it flies over the short fine leg and away to the boundary;
6.1;1w;Lee to Chanderpaul, 1 wide down leg side and that's a wide, Lee doesn't think it should have been but every umpire will call those;
5.6;1;Johnson to Chanderpaul, 1 run Chanderpaul gets off the mark deflecting this one behind point;
5.5;?;Johnson to Chanderpaul, no run pushed into the off side, they can't manufacture a single;
5.4;W;Johnson to Sarwan, OUT excellent catch! Sarwan knows he has to get the runs flowing and drives on the up, but it's a slower ball and he doesn't quite time it, the ball looks like clearing James Hopes at mid off but he times his leap to perfection and snares it with both hands above his head;Ramnaresh Sarwan c Hopes b Johnson 7 (17m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 63.63;
5.3;?;Johnson to Sarwan, no run another shortish ball, Sarwan looks to pull but mistimes it and the ball lobs just in front of mid on;
5.2;?;Johnson to Sarwan, no run Sarwan backs away and tries for an expansive cut, the shortish one from Johnson bounces a touch too much and beats the bat;
5.1;?;Johnson to Sarwan, no run driven off the back foot to cover and there's no run;
4.6;?;Lee to Marshall, no run forward and he defends this back down the pitch;
4.5;?;Lee to Marshall, no run oh, there's a thick edge from Marshall and it falls just a few centimetres short of Watson at first slip. A stroke of luck for Marshall;
4.4;1;Lee to Sarwan, 1 run driven away to cover and they get a single;
4.3;?;Lee to Sarwan, no run dead on line again and it stays down a touch, Sarwan jumps then has to adjust and does well to get the bat down on this one;

3.5;?;Johnson to Marshall, no run Marshall drives at this one outside off, it beats the bat;
3.4;?;Johnson to Marshall, no run straight-bat defence this time, Johnson gets across to cut it off, another shy at the stumps, this time at the striker's end as Marshall was initially wanting a single, the throw missed though;
3.4;1w;Johnson to Marshall, 1 wide short and down leg side, so that's a wide;
3.3;1;Johnson to Sarwan, 1 run another fast run as Sarwan pokes it to mid on, David Hussey's throw misses at the bowler's end;
3.2;1;Johnson to Marshall, 1 run and there's a very quick single, Marshall pushes to cover and scampers through. Symonds is the fielder, he under-arms it into the stumps at the bowler's end but Marshall gets home, you've got to be mighty fast to beat Symonds;
3.1;1;Johnson to Sarwan, 1 run Sarwan crunches this one wide of point where Clarke makes a terrific diving stop, then turns and throws to the bowler's end where Sarwan was a long, long way short. Lucky for him, Clarke's throw was wide;
2.6;?;Lee to Marshall, no run a wild attempted drive from Marshall, who flashes outside off and sees the ball whizz past the bat;
2.5;?;Lee to Marshall, no run Marshall forward and defends, Lee appeals for lbw and it might have flicked the top of the pad before rocketing off the middle of the bat, but certainly outside the line of off;
2.4;?;Lee to Marshall, no run pushed away defensively to point;
2.3;?;Lee to Marshall, no run Lee probes outside off, Marshall blocks it away;

1.6;?;Johnson to Sarwan, no run angled across Sarwan, who leaves this one;
1.5;4;Johnson to Sarwan, FOUR runs good way to get off the mark, Sarwan quickly onto a short ball with a bit of width and cuts forward of point for a boundary;
1.4;?;Johnson to Sarwan, no run Sarwan on the back foot to start, punches it away to cover;
1.3;W;Johnson to Gayle, OUT and Johnson does the job! It's on a good length and Gayle doesn't quite know whether to go back or forward, he gets a thick edge and Ronchi's great game continues as he dives to his left and takes a very good catch;Chris Gayle c ?Ronchi b Johnson 5 (6m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.5;
1.2;?;Johnson to Gayle, no run cut away square but straight to point;

0.6;?;Lee to Marshall, no run Marshall forward and defends towards cover;

0.4;4;Lee to Gayle, FOUR runs and Gayle gets off the mark with a well controlled drive off the back foot, it races away square through point and he gets himself a boundary;

0.2;?;Lee to Gayle, no run left alone outside off this time;
