Data
1.40pm: South Africa needed just 30 minutes of postprandial precision to round the innings up, they should be pleased with keeping Australia below 400 from the position this morning. The tourists lost 6 for 66 - a beastly collapse - after twin tons for Shaun Marsh and Steven Smith, going to show that you just cannot let your resolve waver against this SA unit. They're No. 1 and they know it; but can their batsmen show it? We'll get a few pointers in 10, when Graeme Smith and Alviro Petersen head out to face the wrath of Mitch. Don't go away.
"And Nathan Lyon STILL not out!" exclaims James.
Gary thinks that DLA and the MWT were overrated anyway: "What was that about the 'Magnificent Wagging Tail'? Oh wait, this isn't England here...."

117.4;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run good pace from Steyn, up at 140kph, wide of the stumps though and left alone;
117.3;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run Steyn goes round the wicket to Johnson, slightly back of a length and defended square on the off side;

114.6;3;Steyn to Johnson, 3 runs now he pulls at a short ball, it was outside off which means it goes over mid-on rather than squarer of the wicket...clears mid-off but pulls up on the outfield. Good contest.;
114.5;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run defended on the front foot to cover;
114.4;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run big shout for lbw, angling in from round the wicket, Johnson was shuffling across his crease again. Bounce, perhaps, the issue. They decline to review.

112.6;?;Philander to Johnson, no run worked into the leg side and finds midwicket;
112.5;4;Philander to Johnson, FOUR runs this finds the outside edge, nicely delivery around off stump, but Johnson played with soft hands and the ball scoots fine of gully to the vacant third man;

112.3;?;Philander to Johnson, no run defended to the leg side;

108.5;?;Philander to Harris, no run left alone;
108.4;?;Philander to Harris, no run back of a length, takes the pad into the leg side;
108.3;W;Philander to Marsh, OUT and another! South Africa fighting back. Entices Marsh, who has left so well in this innings, to fiddle at a length delivery outside off and a healthy edge travels at ideal catching height to Smith at first slip. They check the no-ball, but it's comfortable;Shaun Marsh c Smith b Philander 148 (428m 288b 15x4 0x6) SR: 51.38;
108.2;?;Philander to Marsh, no run back of a length, defends with an open face and it runs to backward point. There is then confusion over a run as Johnson races up the pitch but Marsh wants none of it;

107.4;?;McLaren to Johnson, no run outside off, left alone;
107.4;1nb;McLaren to Johnson, (no ball) sharp bouncer this time, de Villiers has to leap to take it, but McLaren has overstepped;
107.3;?;McLaren to Johnson, no run and again! Not quite so full this time but again it goes past the edge as Johnson presses forward;
107.2;?;McLaren to Johnson, no run an appeal goes up, but is then aborted as Johnson drives at this full delivery outside off and the ball zips past the outside edge...there was a noise, but it may have been bat tapping the ground;
107.1;?;McLaren to Johnson, no run beaten from round the wicket, identical to what he did to Marsh in his previous over;
106.6;1;Peterson to Johnson, 1 run full on the stumps, Johnson turns his wrists and places it down to long on to keep the strike;
106.5;?;Peterson to Johnson, no run lets this one go through;
106.4;?;Peterson to Johnson, no run this is driven in the air for a little while, but is wide of short cover;

105.5;2;McLaren to Marsh, 2 runs worked away from a full length on middle stump through midwicket;

104.5;?;Peterson to Johnson, no run driven up to mid-off;
104.4;?;Peterson to Johnson, no run some turn there form out of the footmarks, but it's too wide to bring a shot from Johnson;
104.3;?;Peterson to Johnson, no run a touch quicker outside off, left alone;
104.2;?;Peterson to Johnson, no run full outside off, driven to cover;
104.1;W;Peterson to Haddin, OUT gone! The man who constantly rescued Australia in the Ashes has been given lbw. But he's reviewing. He went for the slog sweep and the question is whether he was struck in line. Or if there's an edge. Doesn't appear either on the first replay. This looks pretty good for Peterson. Haddin did get quite a way across his crease, but it's umpire's call on hitting in line with off stump so the decision will stay.;Brad Haddin lbw b Peterson 0 (7m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
103.6;?;McLaren to Marsh, no run forward and defending to cover;
103.5;1lb;McLaren to Haddin, 1 leg bye short, angled down the leg side and pulled around the corner, although it doesn't actually make contact with the bat;
103.4;?;McLaren to Haddin, no run gets across to off stump, defends to mid-on;
103.3;W;McLaren to Smith, OUT edged and gone! Smith's concentration is broken, he's been leaving them all morning, most of yesterday too, but this time he pokes at one in the channel, hard hands and a thick deflection flew to second slip. Decent line from McLaren, the ball maybe straightened a little more than Smith expected - uncertainty reclaims the corridor;Steven Smith c Petersen b McLaren 100 (288m 213b 13x4 0x6) SR: 46.94;
103.2;?;McLaren to Smith, no run length delivery, shaping back a little from wide of the stumps, Smith lets it through;
103.1;1;McLaren to Marsh, 1 run on middle and leg, worked into a gap in front of square;
102.6;1;Peterson to Marsh, 1 run Peterson goes over the wicket now, turning gently in and defended on off;
102.5;4;Peterson to Marsh, FOUR runs flatter and slightly wide, Marsh uses the angle to glide the ball through backward point, delicate stroke and it brings him four;
102.4;?;Peterson to Marsh, no run props forward to defend on middle and off;
102.3;1;Peterson to Smith, 1 run sliding on with the arm, Smith closes the face and works behind square, beats the fielder... ton up for Devereux, his fourth in Tests - in fact his fourth in his last seven Tests but his first against anyone other than England;
102.2;?;Peterson to Smith, no run full and flighted, gets behind it to defend;
102.1;?;Peterson to Smith, no run length ball on the stumps, chopped into the ground in front of square;

101.3;4;McLaren to Marsh, FOUR runs Faf du Plessis does his Superman impression in the gully, trying to get to an aerial cut from Marsh, wasn't on control but hit hard and wide of the fielder, safely for four;
101.2;?;McLaren to Marsh, no run sliding across the lefty from over the wicket, lets it go through to the keeper;
101.1;1;McLaren to Smith, 1 run stays in the crease and works a good-length ball into a gap at midwicket;
100.6;?;Peterson to Marsh, no run looped up and there's some dip again around middle and off, not much turn and Marsh defends;
100.5;1;Peterson to Smith, 1 run full, on the stumps, Smith uses those twinkling toes and flips the ball round the corner for one more;
100.4;1;Peterson to Marsh, 1 run sliding on to the pads, Marsh works it behind square with a turn of the wrists;
100.3;?;Peterson to Marsh, no run touch flatter, dipping on middle and off, again Marsh shows it the maker's name;
100.2;?;Peterson to Marsh, no run full and straightening around off, played back to the bowler;
100.1;?;Peterson to Marsh, no run round the wicket, tossed up and defended outside the line of off;

99.4;?;Steyn to Smith, no run length outside off, tapped towards backward point;
99.3;?;Steyn to Smith, no run caught on the crease, the ball loops to slip... but it was off thigh pad! Searing stuff from Steyn, beats Smith for pace but there wasn't any bat on it;

99.1;?;Steyn to Smith, no run splice-jarring length from Steyn, holding its line on off, Smith plays it well, down into the off side;
98.6;?;Philander to Marsh, no run length delivery, quite wide and it stays a bit low, reaching de Villiers at knee height;
98.5;?;Philander to Marsh, no run real half-tracker this time, sails through around head height as Marsh watches it impassively;
98.4;?;Philander to Marsh, no run skiddy bumper from Philander, there's a swipe from Marsh down the leg side, the ball deflects off something but is it glove? Aleem Dar isn't certain to give it out, so South Africa, having celebrated confidently, call for the review... Could have been forearm, maybe flicked the shirt; yes, it does brush Marsh's side, appears to go under the glove - real-time Snicko can't detect contact, nothing conclusive anyway, so Marsh gets the green light to continue;
98.3;?;Philander to Marsh, no run goodish length on the stumps, tapped to leg;
98.2;1;Philander to Smith, 1 run slightly back of a length, angled in at the batsman's body, Smith dabs it short into the on side for a single;
98.1;?;Philander to Smith, no run comes forward and plays a length ball into the covers;
97.6;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run gets on the front foot and tucks the bat out of the way as Steyn thunders through impotently in the channel outside off once again;
97.5;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run wider still, Marsh won't be tempted out there, though;
97.4;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run Steyn continues to probe on a good length, wide of the stumps, nothing doing from the batsman;
97.3;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run in the channel outside off, wide enough for Marsh to ignore;
97.2;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run goes round the wicket, extra pace and bounce and the ball zings through, drawing an indeterminate prod from Marsh;
97.1;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run angled across the left-hander, Marsh leaves;
96.6;1;Philander to Marsh, 1 run comes forward and drops the ball short into the covers, soft hands from marsh and they scamper one;
96.5;?;Philander to Marsh, no run slightly fuller length on off stump, pressing forward and defended back to the bowler;
96.4;?;Philander to Marsh, no run back in the channel outside off, leaves this one be;
96.3;?;Philander to Marsh, no run Philander bangs this in, bit of extra grunt and there's a loud exclamation as Marsh swats across the line ineffectually, the ball passing over a horizontal bat;
96.2;2;Philander to Marsh, 2 runs leg-stump line again from Philander, doesn't bounce much and Marsh tucks a couple through square;
96.1;?;Philander to Marsh, no run on leg stump, clipped firmly to midwicket;
95.6;?;Steyn to Smith, no run in the corridor, rising off a length, happily left alone;
95.5;?;Steyn to Smith, no run now Steyn goes exploring further up the pitch, maybe stays a touch low and clunks into the bottom inside half of the bat before squirting in front of square - Smith did well to keep that out;

95.3;?;Steyn to Smith, no run on the stumps, gets across and works defensively to leg;

95.1;?;Steyn to Smith, no run in the channel, wide enough for Smith to again leave comfortably;
94.6;?;Philander to Marsh, no run that's a beaut from Philander, extra dip in and a little nibble off the deck past the forward grope from Marsh;
94.5;?;Philander to Marsh, no run pitching on middle and leg, comes forward and defends back to the bowler;
94.4;?;Philander to Marsh, no run this takes the outer half of the bat, Marsh keeps it down as it skips to gully;
94.3;?;Philander to Marsh, no run good length, around off stump, tight probing line and Marsh defends square;

93.5;?;Steyn to Smith, no run tighter on off stump, sharply defended into the off side;

92.1;2;Philander to Marsh, 2 runs slightly short and on the stumps, worked behind square and they run well for a couple;
91.6;?;Steyn to Smith, no run woosh, this takes off on the way past Smith, who plants the front foot and shoulders arms, the ball coming back and jumping off a length, nearly tickling Smith's armpit as it flies through;

90.3;?;Philander to Smith, no run in the channel, doesn't deviate much, Smith leaves;
90.2;?;Philander to Smith, no run off-stump line, still warming up at around 125kph, covers up in defence;
90.1;?;Philander to Smith, no run right on the money to start off, Philander nips a length ball back at Smith, hit on the back leg but above the flap and the appeal is turned down;
89.6;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run works it with the swing to midwicket;
89.5;1;Steyn to Smith, 1 run even with just two balls left Smith is happy to chase some width and drives this out to deep point;

89.1;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run defended square into the off side;
88.6;?;Morkel to Smith, no run ooh, that's an excellent delivery as it is angled into Smith's body...he fends at it with his gloves in front of his face and does well to keep it down rather than flying to any of the catchers;
88.5;?;Morkel to Smith, no run shorter delivery, eye-catching climb through to de Villiers but it was better looking than it really was;
88.4;?;Morkel to Smith, no run full outside off, doesn't play;
88.3;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length outside off, defended to cover;
88.2;3;Morkel to Marsh, 3 runs this time it's fuller, making him play, Marsh clips it away from off stump wide of mid-on and his earlier leg issues don't seem so bad now as he skips back for a third;
88.1;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run outside off, left alone;
87.6;4;Steyn to Smith, FOUR runs picks off a loose delivery, cutting a wide delivery hard into the ground near the pitch and it bounces over point;

86.4;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run short outside off, cut in front of square to cover;
86.3;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run well bowled again, an awkward short ball takes Marsh on the shoulder as he tries to sway out of the line...it was never a catch, of course, but was a good job because no one went for it;
86.2;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run that's a good delivery, touch of extra bounce from back of a length and it takes Marsh on the bottom hand as he defends;
86.1;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run short of a length going across Marsh who lifts his bat high out of the line;
85.6;?;Steyn to Smith, no run that makes it all six in the over left alone outside off...Australia will be more than happy with that tonight;
85.5;?;Steyn to Smith, no run another one sails through to the de Villiers...bit of a waste of the new ball, unless it's part of a masterplan;
85.4;?;Steyn to Smith, no run one of the features of Smith's play today has been how he's left the ball and this is another one;
85.3;?;Steyn to Smith, no run a little fuller but still not making the batsman play late in the day;
85.2;?;Steyn to Smith, no run shorter of length, shaping away, wide enough to leave alone;

84.6;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run left alone outside off;
84.5;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run speared down the leg side;
84.4;4;Morkel to Marsh, FOUR runs close! Marsh gets another boundary, cutting with power, but it was the air just past a flying Duminy at backward point;
84.3;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run works with the angle from round the wicket and tucks this to square leg;
84.2;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run this one climbs outside off but it's wide enough for Marsh to not have to worry;
84.1;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run round the wicket, on a length outside off, defended to the covers;

83.3;1;Steyn to Marsh, 1 run that's more like it, full outside off and Marsh was reaching for it. The ball took a think inside edge through the leg side;
83.2;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run swings down the leg side again, encouraging movement if he can shift his line outside off;
83.1;4lb;Steyn to Marsh, 4 leg byes starts on leg stump and it glances off the pads past a diving de Villiers down to the fine-leg boundary;
82.6;?;Philander to Smith, no run swings past off stump, a gentle and expensive over to begin with;
82.5;4;Philander to Smith, FOUR runs well, this is the risk with keeping it full - Smith drives a half volley handsomely through the off side. Philander not on his game yet;
82.4;?;Philander to Smith, no run a teasing length from Philander, happy to put it there for the drive to try and find the edge but this one is left again;
82.3;?;Philander to Smith, no run outside off, left alone;
82.2;4;Philander to Smith, FOUR runs chancy! Smith is tempted into driving a full, wide delivery and his feet are stuck in the crease but he gets away with it as the ball slices off the thick outer part of the bat through backward point;
82.1;?;Philander to Smith, no run the first delivery swings outside off, but it was a gentle loosener and quite floaty;
81.6;?;Peterson to Marsh, no run and another one is patted back to the bowler. New ball, anyone?;
81.5;?;Peterson to Marsh, no run defended to the covers;
81.4;?;Peterson to Marsh, no run uses his feet and nearly chips this in the air towards midwicket;

 Innings Start
11.55am: Tasty enough for you? The opposition may have changed but Australia and Mitchell Johnson are doing the same job they carried off repeatedly in the Ashes. The plan now will be to come out and plunder runs with a big lead banked and the pressure off... though Cape Town 2011 may just be at the back of their minds. There'll be about half an hour for them to bat before lunch. Oh, and to add some spice to the fourth innings, Johnson will start on a hat-trick, having taken wickets with the last ball of his 17th over and the first of his 18th. Let's all just take a minute to hug ourselves.
61.1;W;Johnson to Morkel, OUT goes round the wicket, snorting bouncer and there's a thin edge through to Haddin! Johnson has seven-for and Australia have claimed an 191-run lead, not to mention a few dozen psychological Nectar points... Morkel couldn't get out of the way, fending in front of his chin and sawn off in a manner that befell his more-qualified colleagues;Morne Morkel c ?Haddin b Johnson 0 (6m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
60.6;2;Harris to Steyn, 2 runs back of a length and Steyn makes room, swings a baseball slug down the ground, came off the bat near the splice but went quickly enough past the bowler for a couple;
60.5;?;Harris to Steyn, no run drops back in the crease and defends in front of the stumps;
60.4;?;Harris to Steyn, no run dug in short and Steyn swings wildly at this, fails to connect;
60.3;?;Harris to Steyn, no run goes back and defends in front of the stumps;
60.2;2;Harris to Steyn, 2 runs pitched up and driven this time, mistimed and in the air but past mid-off for a couple;
60.1;?;Harris to Steyn, no run banged in short of a length, sways back and underneath the line;
59.6;W;Johnson to de Villiers, OUT slower ball, drives again but can't clear mid-off - Johnson has another! Tried to mete out some more treatment, down on one knee to drive but the ball spooned off the toe of the bat. Was 131kph, so only slower by Johnsonian standards... De Villiers' thrilling resistance is ended nine short of a century;AB de Villiers c Warner b Johnson 91 (241m 148b 10x4 2x6) SR: 61.48;
59.5;4;Johnson to de Villiers, FOUR runs de Villiers is batting on a different pitch out there, picks a full ball and flays it on the up over cover, so much power in that shot and it takes him into the 90s - no one else has more than 25;
59.4;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run short and at the top of de Villiers' block, swipes at it and misses;
59.3;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run full and outside off, de Villiers tries to drive and chops into the ground;
59.2;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run pitched up, just 132kph to de Villiers, saving himself, punched to mid-off;
59.1;1;Johnson to Steyn, 1 run back of a length and climbing at Steyn, who plays it well, defending down into the leg side and they scamper one to take them past the follow-on target and get AB on strike;
58.6;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run length in the channel to de Villiers, back over the wicket, defended;
58.5;1;Harris to Steyn, 1 run ripping bouncer from Harris, he can't keep this down but it loops into a vacant area at backward point! Rising quickly, pinching the gloves on the handle and then thudding into the shoulder... Steyn would have appreciated that had he bowled it himself;
58.4;?;Harris to Steyn, no run this spits up at Steyn, jamming into the splice, does well to keep it down;
58.3;?;Harris to Steyn, no run drops short, at the body, Steyn lines it up well enough to block from the crease;
58.2;?;Harris to Steyn, no run good pace, around 140kph, defended on the stumps. Harris is bowling round the wicket;
58.1;?;Harris to Steyn, no run Harris begins with a bouncer, to push Steyn back, though he has no thought of playing at it;
57.6;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run stands tall on the back foot, plays into the ground and to the man at short midwicket;
57.5;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run length ball on leg stump, taps this one back respectfully;
57.4;6;Lyon to de Villiers, SIX runs crump! Here goes de Villiers, trying to put the frighteners on Lyon, skipping down the track and smacking a lofted drive over long-on, several rows back into the crowd - an almighty mow (which is different to Mitch's almighty mo');
57.3;1;Lyon to Steyn, 1 run floated up on middle and leg, tucked into a gap at midwicket for a single;
57.2;W;Lyon to Philander, OUT big appeal for lbw, but surely that pitched outside leg. Given not out on the field. It was quite short and Philander misses his whip off the back foot. Well, Clarke has decided to review. This might actually be closer than I thought. It's pitched in line! He's out! Terrific review from the Aussies. That's clattering into leg stump.;Vernon Philander lbw b Lyon 15 (54m 35b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85;
57.1;?;Lyon to Philander, no run gets well forward and works it back along the pitch to Lyon;
56.6;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run a touch too wide, Harris not entirely happy with himself after that over;
56.5;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run full outside off, 137kph, left alone;
56.4;1;Harris to Philander, 1 run short again and pull again, this is a good contest and it's another impressive shot in front of square;
56.3;?;Harris to Philander, no run round the wicket, full on off stump, defended;
56.2;2;Harris to Philander, 2 runs this time the short ball is more at the body and it's well played by Philander who has looked pretty confident so far, pulling in front of square and he's able to keep the ball down as well;
56.1;?;Harris to Philander, no run short ball first up, wide of off stump, Philander tries to fetch it with a pull but doesn't make contact;
55.6;1;Lyon to Philander, 1 run this time it's dragged down shorter, Philander goes back and pulls but it doesn't come off the middle and trickles to deep square leg;
55.5;?;Lyon to Philander, no run blocked into the off side;
55.4;?;Lyon to Philander, no run slightly straighter, subtle variation from Lyon, played back to the bowler;
55.3;?;Lyon to Philander, no run the line is outside off this time, pushed across from round the wicket, and he's forward to defend;

55.1;1;Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run gets across outside off and flicks this down to long on;
54.6;1;Siddle to de Villiers, 1 run full on off stump, comes forward and opens the face to place it into the point area;
54.5;1;Siddle to Philander, 1 run well controlled, Siddle drops in a rare short ball and Philander pulls it behind square...rolling the wrists to send it quickly to ground;
54.4;1;Siddle to de Villiers, 1 run push and go from de Villiers, he was always going to make that single once Johnson was a little slow to react at mid-on...his throw was also miles off target;
54.3;?;Siddle to de Villiers, no run full and driven to mid-on;
54.2;?;Siddle to de Villiers, no run defended to short mid-on...just starting to look a little harder work for the bowlers;
54.1;?;Siddle to de Villiers, no run keeping it full and straight, worked out to midwicket;
53.6;?;Lyon to Philander, no run slightly slower, more air, 83kph and Philander leans forward to defend;
53.5;1;Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run shorter delivery, onto the back foot and punches towards mid-off who is deep enough to allow a single;
53.4;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run clipped to midwicket;
53.3;4;Lyon to de Villiers, FOUR runs that's fantastic from de Villiers. A gem. Comes down the pitch to a ball tossed outside off and them drives along the ground through cover...just kept himself leg-side of the ball to open up the off side;
53.2;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run gets across outside off, worked back to the bowler;
53.1;1;Lyon to Philander, 1 run round the wicket, outside off and it's driven firmly, but without much timing, towards mid-off;
52.6;?;Siddle to de Villiers, no run defended to short mid-on;
52.5;?;Siddle to de Villiers, no run clips this off middle and leg but midwicket is able to cut it off;

52.2;?;Siddle to de Villiers, no run full on middle, defended to the man at short mid-on;
52.1;3;Siddle to Philander, 3 runs finds the outside edge and shoots through backward point, Philander was squared up as he aimed to play to leg - the ball straightened on him - but the edge didn't carry very far in the air;
51.6;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run left alone outside off;
51.5;1;Harris to Philander, 1 run back of a length, straight delivery, tucked into midwicket;
51.4;?;Harris to Philander, no run full outside off, left alone;
51.3;1;Harris to de Villiers, 1 run good running, just! Pushed into the off side, de Villiers sets off straight away and Philander would have just made it with a direct hit from Smith;
51.2;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run he's not changed gears as yet, de Villiers, and is happy to leave another one alone;
51.1;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run shaping away outside off, de Villiers shoulders arms;
50.6;?;Siddle to Philander, no run short over off stump, doesn't quite bounce as Philander expected but carries over his helmet;

50.4;?;Siddle to Philander, no run nice shot, forward and drives firmly but picks out mid-off;

48.1;?;Siddle to Philander, no run full on off stump, driven to mid-on;
47.6;4;Johnson to de Villiers, FOUR runs superb from de Villiers as he upper cuts this short delivery over backward point...completely in control, using the pace of Johnson;
47.5;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run that's a better delivery, short of a length at off stump and he's jumping into his defensive shot;
47.4;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run short, down the leg side, not his best bouncer;
47.3;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run slower ball outside off, 132kph, and it's prodded to cover;

45.6;1;Johnson to de Villiers, 1 run tucked off the stumps into midwicket;

45.2;1;Johnson to Philander, 1 run back over the wicket, gives him a full ball around off stump and Philander props forward and pushes into the vast space on the off side;
45.1;W;Johnson to Peterson, OUT too quick, too accurate, too hostile, too good...Johnson bags his fifth! Another precisely delivered short ball, homing in on Peterson's rib cage and armpit. Those are fiendishly difficult to play for a left hander from round the wicket and all he can do is thrust his gloves up, then the ball balloons off them towards second slip;Robin Peterson c Clarke b Johnson 10 (28m 23b 2x4 0x6) SR: 43.47;
44.6;?;Siddle to de Villiers, no run tight on off stump, defended to mid-off;

43.6;?;Johnson to Peterson, no run another bouncer, over leg stump this time and Peterson bends down underneath it;
43.5;?;Johnson to Peterson, no run gets beaten this time, it's a fuller delivery and Peterson is sparing at it off the back foot as the ball angles across him;
43.4;?;Johnson to Peterson, no run begins with a bouncer, well directed over middle and off and Peterson plays it well as he keeps his eyes on the ball and sways out of the line;

43.2;?;Johnson to Peterson, no run short ball over leg stump, ducks underneath and has a glance at the umpire...perhaps about the light.;

41.5;4;Johnson to Peterson, FOUR runs shuffles across his stumps again and this time flicks a full delivery through square leg, Johnson was aiming to go behind the pads. Good thinking, good response.;
41.4;?;Johnson to Peterson, no run an appeal from Johnson as Peterson goes well across his stumps and tries to pull a short ball angling into his body...he ended up outside off stump after playing that. Tough line for the left hander to play;
41.3;?;Johnson to Peterson, no run shoves this one down the leg side, good take by Haddin diving to his right;
41.2;1lb;Johnson to de Villiers, 1 leg bye gets a short ball on leg stump, goes for the pull and it comes off this thigh guard;
41.1;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run goes to pull a short ball, he's through his shot a fraction early and takes a painful blow on his forearm. Taking a few deep breaths. Johnson held that delivery back a fraction;

39.3;4;Johnson to Peterson, FOUR runs well, that's a handsome start...comes forward, and crunches a cover drive on the up. Not sure how many more he'll get pitched up;
39.2;W;Johnson to McLaren, OUT beauty! Four for Johnson. Comes back from outside off and snakes past McLaren's inside edge to knock back the off stump. Have to say it was a massive gap, but found with pinpoint accuracy;Ryan McLaren b Johnson 8 (37m 33b 1x4 0x6) SR: 24.24;
39.1;1;Johnson to de Villiers, 1 run flicked away from off stump through midwicket;
38.6;?;Lyon to McLaren, no run left alone outside off;
38.5;?;Lyon to McLaren, no run that's a crackerjack! But has he nicked it? Massive appeal. Dar says not out. And they don't review. Well, Haddin sounded convinced (not that means anything). And it's a brilliant decision from the umpire, that turned and beat the edge with the ball brushing the back leg. Lovely bowling. Excellent umpiring.

37.1;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run good start, almost a massive lbw shout, on off stump and starts to come back but it struck him too high;

30.5;W;Lyon to Duminy, OUT goes after Lyon again but he doesn't get hold of it... and Johnson takes a fantastic catch running back from mid-off! The breakthrough comes, after a 67-run stand, and it's Lyon, so often a diamond in the dust for Clarke, who nips one out. Maybe saw Duminy coming and dragged it down slightly, wasn't to the pitch as he tried to loft down the ground again, though he still almost cleared Johnson, who was set a little back, those long, loping legs ate up the ground and he threw himself, full stretch, a brilliant one-handed snag above his head;Jean-Paul Duminy c Johnson b Lyon 25 (77m 48b 1x4 1x6) SR: 52.08;

27.5;?;Siddle to de Villiers, no run shortish but not so straight, happy to let this go outside off;
27.4;4;Siddle to de Villiers, FOUR runs drops short and this sits up and begs to be spanked, which is just what de Villiers does, punishing swing of the forearms and he batters the ball through midwicket for a boundary - SA hundred up too;

26.4;6;Lyon to Duminy, SIX runs tossed up and Duminy takes the invitation, hits cleanly through the line and caresses the ball for six over long-on. Yes, I said 'caresses' ... top shot;

23.6;1w;Johnson to de Villiers, 1 wide slams in a bumper to finish the over, de Villiers would have needed a stepladder to reach it, Haddin only just manages to with his fingertips. That won't quite finish the over, then;

15.3;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run back over the wicket to AB, full on off stump, driven to mid-off;

12.6;W;Siddle to Amla, OUT massive appeal for lbw! GIven not out by Aleem Dar. Boy, it looked close. Clarke reviews. Surely only an edge can save him.

8.2;?;Siddle to Amla, no run left alone outside off;
8.1;3;Siddle to de Villiers, 3 runs starts short and wide, big loosener, loops off the surface and de Villiers is almost early on his shot as he flat-bats it through the covers;
7.6;?;Johnson to Amla, no run he's ducked into a short ball! Bit like how he was bowled against India. This time he takes a blow on the shoulder. No lbw appeal. It certainly kept low, was pitched quite short;
7.5;2;Johnson to Amla, 2 runs nicely done by Amla, keeping his composure, it's a full delivery outside off and he leans forward to place it past mid-off;
7.4;3;Johnson to de Villiers, 3 runs gets this one through the leg side, sort of a straight-bat flick into midwicket;
7.3;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run short of a length, 147kph, he gets inside the line and tucks it towards short leg;
7.2;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run full on off stump, defended square into the off side;
7.1;W;Johnson to du Plessis, OUT and another! This is brutal from Johnson - 151kph! Du Plessis had no idea, the ball reared at him from short of a length, it wasn't a full-on bouncer, and all he could do was spar at it with his gloves in front of his face and the ball flew off the shoulder of bat to second slip. Fabulous, breathtaking fast bowling.;Faf du Plessis c Clarke b Johnson 3 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60;
6.6;4;Harris to Amla, FOUR runs ah, that's lovely...a response from Amla as he flicks a delivery from around middle and off, just angling in, through square leg;

5.5;2;Johnson to du Plessis, 2 runs leg side, clipped through square for a couple to get off the mark;
5.4;?;Johnson to du Plessis, no run nearly gets a first-baller, edged just short of second slip! Johnson right on the money, back of a length and squares du Plessis up but it didn't carry;
5.3;W;Johnson to Petersen, OUT oh no, Alviro, what have you done?! Short and slightly wide and Petersen feathers a nick behind trying to cut! No obligation to play, probably wasn't quite enough room for the shot and Johnson's pace does for another, just a scrape and Haddin grabs it, punches the air in familiar fashion. That's what happens when you're stuck on the back foot, clenching like nobody's business;Alviro Petersen c ?Haddin b Johnson 2 (24m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
5.2;?;Johnson to Petersen, no run phlegmatic defence from Petersen so far, happy to sit in the crease and block Johnson's fire with ice;
5.1;?;Johnson to Petersen, no run steams in, back of a length and sliding towards the slips, Petersen drops back and defends;
4.6;?;Harris to Amla, no run short of a length and leaving Amla, wide of the stumps and left;
4.5;?;Harris to Amla, no run fiery bumper from Harris now, 143 kph and Haddin has to leap full stretch to take it;
4.4;?;Harris to Amla, no run goes wider, seaming away a little, no stroke offered;
4.3;?;Harris to Amla, no run Amla shuffles back and across and shows Harris a straight bat on off stump;

4.1;2;Harris to Amla, 2 runs pitched up, Harris' line veers towards leg and a wristy glance gets Amla a couple behind square;

Good point, from Tom: "It's always going to be about Johnson, but there's the Rhino humbly plugging away at an average of 21 #worldclass"
 Innings Start
And that's the declaration...a little out of nowhere. Typical Clarke, really. No hanging around. He's seen enough of the pitch today. The South African openers run off, I'm not sure they were ready for that. Clarke thinking on his feet. So the notional target is 482 and there are 174 overs left in the match - that's a manageable asking rate of 2.77. Nice spot from Ben, there were no runs off the bat this morning.
Mike: "Australian overconfidence could just be their downfall....the target is do-able if SA knuckle down!"
72.2;W;Steyn to Marsh, OUT edged, and caught behind! Reward for consistent bowling early this morning, Marsh fiddles outside off without much footwork and the healthy edge is pouched by de Villiers diving to his left;Shaun Marsh c ?de Villiers b Steyn 44 (106m 84b 5x4 1x6) SR: 52.38;
72.1;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run nips in from outside off, takes an inside into Marsh's leg;
71.6;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run that's a conventional delivery, full outside off, what you may term 'normal' carry as Clarke leaves it alone;
71.5;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run beaten again! Another one that keeps down outside off. Clarke isn't outwardly smiling, but I bet he is inside;
71.4;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run outside off, left alone;
71.3;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run and now this one climbs from a similar length and de Villiers jumps to take...too wide to make Clarke play;
71.2;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run more low bounce! Short of a length and it scubs past Clarke's inside edge as he jabs at it with his feet off the ground;
71.1;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run short outside off, left alone;
70.6;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run angled in from round the wicket, shapes to play to leg but is taken high on the pads;
70.5;?;Steyn to Marsh, no run finds the edge, in the channel outside off, but it falls well short of Smith at first slip;
70.5;1w;Steyn to Marsh, 1 wide that's a very high bouncer, climbs way over the batsman's head and it's called wide;

70.1;?;Steyn to Clarke, no run full on off stump, 136kph, defended to the covers;
69.6;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run and a beauty to end the over, jags around from short of a length and beats the outside edge...that was a quality over, just a shame from South Africa's point of view that the lead is 479;
69.5;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run short and at the body, 146kph, this time he bounces as you would expect and carries over Marsh's back...this a lively start from Morkel;
69.4;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run closer to off stump, left alone;
69.3;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run full and wide outside off, but again it climbs through to de Villiers who takes it above his head...and this is with a 70-over old ball;
69.2;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run takes another blow, this time a shorter delivery and it rockets into Marsh's shoulder as he makes an unconvincing attempt to take evasive action...he accepted a blow there;
69.1;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run good start, round the wicket, short of a length and there's extra bounce which takes Marsh's top glove as he tries to defend...well, I say good start but not if you are a South African batsman;
68.6;1;Peterson to Marsh, 1 run drops short, stays back and punches another single through the off side - the umpires call stumps and everyone troops off for the day;

41.3;?;Morkel to Warner, no run fuller on off stump, defended;
41.2;2;Morkel to Warner, 2 runs worked into the leg side;
41.1;?;Morkel to Warner, no run extra bounce from back of a length and it rears over Warner's top edge as aims through the off side;
40.6;1;Philander to Warner, 1 run a short ball, fetched from outside off stump and pulled in front of square;
40.5;1;Philander to Doolan, 1 run and now he drives off the back foot, square through backward point;
40.4;4;Philander to Doolan, FOUR runs oh, that's lovely from Doolan. A classical cover drive, on the up it was a full half volley, and he just strode forward and drove through the line. Textbook.;
40.3;?;Philander to Doolan, no run out with a hit! Warner would have gone if Philander's throw was on target. Doolan dropped the ball into the leg side, Warner was straight out the blocks but sent back by Doolan. He was almost half way up the pitch and wouldn't have beaten the throw back;
40.2;?;Philander to Doolan, no run back outside off stump, fuller, defended to cover;
40.1;4;Philander to Doolan, FOUR runs brings out the hook this time, it's more top edge than middle and races safety to the fine-leg boundary;
39.6;1;Morkel to Doolan, 1 run tucks this neatly off his hip to long leg;
39.5;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run another big lbw shout, but perhaps shading down the leg side...Doolan trapped on the back foot by a delivery that skidded through. It's another review from Smith...it's clearly not hitting enough of leg stump. Might even miss altogether...just clipping;

38.6;?;Philander to Warner, no run this bouncer sails over his head;
38.5;?;Philander to Warner, no run and now he takes a blow on the shoulder, ducking into a short ball which again didn't really get up;
38.4;?;Philander to Warner, no run more low bounce, beats Warner's attempt to pull and misses off stump...Australia will love that. South Africa won't;
38.3;?;Philander to Warner, no run tries to take this from outside off into the leg side with his bottom hand but only finds mid-on;
38.2;?;Philander to Warner, no run fuller on off stump, he walks into a defensive push which finds mid-off;

37.6;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run full on off stump, defended to cover;

37.1;1;Morkel to Warner, 1 run worked away from leg stump, deep square into action;
36.6;?;Philander to Doolan, no run aims to work this into the leg side but it lobs off the splice towards mid-on;
36.5;?;Philander to Doolan, no run full outside off, de Villiers takes this on the rise;
36.4;?;Philander to Doolan, no run short of a length, defended on the back foot;
36.3;1;Philander to Warner, 1 run good piece of timing, driving square off the back foot, but this time it's well fielded by Duminy diving from point;
36.2;?;Philander to Warner, no run a short delivery, he pulls straight to midwicket;
36.1;2;Philander to Warner, 2 runs more brisk running from Warner makes this into a brace as he tucks it through straight midwicket;
35.6;1;Morkel to Warner, 1 run tucks this off his legs into midwicket;
35.5;4lb;Morkel to Warner, 4 leg byes the runs continue to flow even this wasn't off the bat, a short delivery strikes the thigh guard and goes fine of de Villiers;
35.4;?;Morkel to Warner, no run takes his bottom hand off the bat as he defends this delivery which bounces a touch more from a good length;
35.3;4;Morkel to Warner, FOUR runs what a way to reach a hundred! Dispatches a wide, full delivery through covers with another pristine drive and that's century No. 6 for Warner. The trademark leap of celebration comes out.;
35.2;?;Morkel to Warner, no run massive appeal for lbw! Given not out by Aleem Dar. Did it pitch outside leg? Smith has reviewed straight away. Was a full length, straightened off a crack, strikes him on the shin and it all depends where it pitched. Outside leg. He'll survive. Another good call from Dar;
35.1;4;Morkel to Warner, FOUR runs pinged away through the off side, a gentle first delivery from Morkel which is outside off...Warner strikes it at the top of the bounce through the covers;
34.6;?;Philander to Doolan, no run short over leg stump, de Villiers takes it at the second grab;
34.5;2;Philander to Doolan, 2 runs pushed off the back foot square of the wicket into the off side and there's another fumble in the field which costs two, and that brings up a maiden Test fifty for Doolan. Composed innings.;
34.4;?;Philander to Doolan, no run doesn't get too far forward to this and it's quite a full delivery, but he pushes it easily enough to cover;
34.3;?;Philander to Doolan, no run this one nips back a touch off the seam, but Doolan's defence is tight with bat and pad together;
34.2;?;Philander to Doolan, no run fuller, brings the batsman forward and the ball runs off the face to point;
34.1;?;Philander to Doolan, no run short of a length, on off stump, Doolan hops into line and defends;
33.6;1;Duminy to Doolan, 1 run floated up nice and full, punched back and Duminy misses it, another single to long-on - tea it is, stuffed SA are;

32.6;1;Peterson to Warner, 1 run tossed up and pushed through the off side for one more;

32.2;?;Peterson to Warner, no run pushed through a little flatter and this time defended coming forwards;
32.1;6;Peterson to Warner, SIX runs South Africa have failed to heed the Warner warning signs, as the pugnacious opener slogs Peterson over deep midwicket... at least the spectator in the crowd caught it;
31.6;1;Duminy to Warner, 1 run floated up on off stump, Warner drills one more through the covers - fairly innocuous stuff from Duminy;
31.5;1;Duminy to Doolan, 1 run on the stumps, clips a single to leg;
31.4;1;Duminy to Warner, 1 run tossed up, on the move again, picks up a single out towards deep extra cover;
31.3;4;Duminy to Warner, FOUR runs overpitched outside off stump and Warner rasps the ball to the rope, long-off gives chase but can't cut it off on the dive;
31.2;?;Duminy to Warner, no run presses forward and taps short on the off side;
31.1;?;Duminy to Warner, no run nearly beaten on the inside, Duminy sliding the ball on with the arm, maybe some uncertainty caused by the rough, clips the edge and rattles into the pads;
30.6;1;Peterson to Warner, 1 run pushed through outside off, good placement to pick up a single into the covers;
30.5;?;Peterson to Warner, no run ah ha, does him in the flight this time, Warner not to the pitch as he tries to drive and gets lucky, lofting over the bowler but short of mid-off;
30.4;?;Peterson to Warner, no run flat, no turn from Peterson, diligently blocked again;
30.3;?;Peterson to Warner, no run goes on with the arm, outside off, defended off the back foot;

28.5;2;Steyn to Doolan, 2 runs pitched up, Doolan looks increasingly confident and drives off the front foot, extra cover can't stop it cleanly and they get a couple;
28.4;4;Steyn to Doolan, FOUR runs takes the edge this time but it was controlled, opening the face and guiding the ball to unguarded third man;
28.3;?;Steyn to Doolan, no run drawn into playing in the channel, could have left this but sucked in and nearly spat out, saved by a few molecules of fresh air;
28.2;?;Steyn to Doolan, no run straighter line and defended from the crease;

27.3;?;McLaren to Warner, no run goes back and cops a short ball towards point;
27.2;6;McLaren to Warner, SIX runs why run when you can put the ball in the stands? Length ball from McLaren, carted derisively back over the bowler's head, clean swing of the bat and that's trademark act of Warner belligerence;
27.1;?;McLaren to Warner, no run sliding across the lefty, softly dropped into the off side but Warner elects not to run;
26.6;4;Steyn to Doolan, FOUR runs strays down the leg side, Doolan just uses the pace to help it on its way to the long leg boundary;
26.5;1;Steyn to Warner, 1 run plays back and again close to dragging on, bottom edge with the bat away from the body, deflects off the pad into the off side and they steal a run;
26.4;4;Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs dismissive batting, clever too, slightly back of a length, not all that wide but steered over the slips, ramped deliberately and giving the catchers no chance - hundred stand up between these two, Warner with two thirds of them;
26.3;?;Steyn to Warner, no run better line, working the pace up to 140 kays, defended short into the off side;
26.2;?;Steyn to Warner, no run sprayed wide of the off stump again, this time the batsman keeps his bat tucked away;
26.1;?;Steyn to Warner, no run short and wide, not part of the plan, I think, but Warner slaps a cut to gully on the bounce;

25.5;?;McLaren to Doolan, no run back of a length, over the top of off stump, Doolan shows it the maker's name;
25.4;1;McLaren to Warner, 1 run back of a length, again Warner works off his body, behind square and Amla gets the throw to de Villiers on the run this time;

25.2;?;McLaren to Warner, no run stays back and is beaten, good length from McLaren, creating indecision and a woolly poke;
25.1;4;McLaren to Warner, FOUR runs angled across, again has Warner playing injudiciously away from his body, feeling for it and gets a thick outside edge, between the slips and gully and it beats the chasing fielder to the boundary rope;
24.6;1;Peterson to Warner, 1 run tossed up outside off, on the move and plucks one more through the off side;
24.5;?;Peterson to Warner, no run tossed up, spinning in as Warner tries to help it over deep square, big swing and a miss and struck on the front pad... Peterson appeals but that was appreciably outside the line;
24.4;?;Peterson to Warner, no run turns a straight ball to leg;
24.3;3;Peterson to Doolan, 3 runs short of a length again, worked off the back foot through midwicket, another sloppy bit of fielding as the throw comes in gifts the batsmen a third;
24.2;4;Peterson to Doolan, FOUR runs drops short and Doolan slices a back-foot drive past slip, there was more bounce than expected but still ends up being four;
24.1;1;Peterson to Warner, 1 run tossed up outside off, comes forward and taps one through the covers;
23.6;?;McLaren to Doolan, no run wide of the stumps, doesn't get up at all and Doolan keeps the safety on;
23.5;2;McLaren to Doolan, 2 runs straighter line, worked neatly off the pads through midwicket and they have time to gambol two;
23.4;?;McLaren to Doolan, no run in the channel outside off, Doolan allows it through to the keeper;
23.3;1;McLaren to Warner, 1 run back of a length and Warner waits on it, pulls calmly through square leg for one;
23.2;?;McLaren to Warner, no run length ball, gets across to defend;
23.1;?;McLaren to Warner, no run another flash, another edge, another drop! This time from Smith, a valiant effort above his head at first slip, really tough chance and he couldn't grasp it one-handed, the ball falls to earth as South Africa's captain looks despairingly on;
22.6;4;Peterson to Doolan, FOUR runs no respite for the spinner, tossed up outside off this time and Doolan creams a cover drive in front of the fielder in the deep for four more, lovely placement;
22.5;4;Peterson to Doolan, FOUR runs floated up and Doolan leaves his crease, chops over mid-on, shout of "Catch!" from Peterson but it clears the man and runs away to the boundary;
22.4;?;Peterson to Doolan, no run on the stumps, prodded back to the bowler;
22.3;?;Peterson to Doolan, no run full and flighted, comes forward to drive and picks out short extra cover, who tosses back to Peterson as Warner moves to regain his ground;

22.1;1;Peterson to Warner, 1 run over the wicket, slightly short outside off, rocks back and chops one to the deep cover sweeper;
21.6;?;McLaren to Doolan, no run Doolan gets a stride in and watches a length ball pass harmlessly through;
21.5;?;McLaren to Doolan, no run slightly too full, McLaren looking for reverse swing, it seems, driven to the man at extra cover;
21.4;?;McLaren to Doolan, no run good leave, the ball ducking back in from wide of the stumps, missing off by a couple of inches;
21.3;4;McLaren to Doolan, FOUR runs four-ball from McLaren, a long hop put away with pleasing proficiency by Doolan, swivelling through an efficient pull stroke to the midwicket boundary;
21.2;?;McLaren to Doolan, no run pitched up, nibbles back in a fraction as Doolan drives, can't get it away;
21.1;?;McLaren to Doolan, no run good length outside off, easy-paced to begin with, left alone;

20.4;?;Peterson to Warner, no run better delivery, fuller outside off, Warner stretches forward to defend;
20.3;?;Peterson to Warner, no run dragged down short and wide again, a lack of bounce beats Warner's cut but he could barely reach that ball;
20.2;?;Peterson to Warner, no run short and wide but he gets away with it as Warner's cut finds point;
20.1;1;Peterson to Doolan, 1 run round the wicket, full at the stumps, eased down the ground;
19.6;?;Morkel to Warner, no run well directed bouncer which jags back into Warner over middle and leg, causing him to take sharp evasive action;

19.4;1;Morkel to Doolan, 1 run fuller, angling into middle and off, defended towards mid-on where it escapes for a single;
19.3;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run another sign of some lower bounce, this is on off stump and Doolan is on the back foot which means he has to jab down to keep it out;
19.2;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run a good short ball, angling into Doolan as he sways out of the line...he's playing those deliveries well;
19.1;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run nips back from short of a length, played off the back foot square of the wicket;
18.6;?;McLaren to Warner, no run responds with another bouncer which doesn't cause Warner any discomfort;
18.5;4;McLaren to Warner, FOUR runs fantastic shot, it wasn't a terrible delivery at all, just back of a length outside off and it was driven square through point to bring up Warner's fifty;
18.4;?;McLaren to Warner, no run gets forward to a full delivery, drives on the walk but can't thread the gap in the off side;

17.4;?;Morkel to Warner, no run;
17.3;4;Morkel to Warner, FOUR runs nicely bowled, but it's a boundary to third man...Warner was reaching this full delivery and it took a thick outside through the gap wide of second slip. Wouldn't have carried to other catchers;
17.2;?;Morkel to Warner, no run close to the same length, on off stump this time, Warner gets forward which takes some doing after that previous ball and punches to mid-on;
17.1;?;Morkel to Warner, no run this one really climbs from quite a full length, it was wide enough to leave but that will not have gone un-noticed as de Villiers takes it above his head;
16.6;1;McLaren to Warner, 1 run jabs at this one outside off, takes a thickish edge wide of the slips towards third man;
16.5;?;McLaren to Warner, no run short ball over off stump, 133kph, Warner is comfortably underneath it;

15.4;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run another bouncer, this time Doolan ducks rather than sway as it climbs over his back;

South Africa not helping themselves at the moment
 Innings Start
Australia win by 281 runs. What a performance from them. They came into the series confident, of course, after the Ashes whitewash but they have just trounced the No. 1 team in the world in four days. And it's not just the margin of victory, it's the mental scars that they have inflicted on the opposition. And, have no doubt, there will be some regardless of the quality in the South Africa team. This has been a humbling. As zcfoutkast puts it: "Battered, bruised, embarrassed!" I will stick around to bring you the presentation ceremony.
So many issues for South Africa to face, just as happened to England in Brisbane a few months ago. But they are at home. It really has been a phenomenal match for the way Australia have dominated. Only when they were 98 for 4 - not an unusual position for them - were they in any trouble. And it's not just about Johnson (even if it mostly is). Don't forget Marsh, or Smith, or Doolan, or Warner or the support from the other bowlers. Quirky stat, too, as it's consecutive wins by the same margin for Australia following the 281-run in Sydney.
Presentation time...Graeme Smith. "It's very disappointing. We've been out-played from word go. Probably one of the most disappointing four days as we've had as a team. We need to reflect, train hard and perform much better. It seemed to one of those games; bowlers picking up niggles, food poisoning. At 100 for 4 we were pretty happy. But credit Mitchell Johnson. AB showed tremendous skill on a difficult wicket, the rest of us have performed well for a period of time so need to look back to those moments. We allowed Australia to play front-runner cricket and that's unusual for us."
Michael Clarke. "Winning is always the best start. Credit to the bowlers and batters, Alex Doolan played an amazing innings on debut. We knew how tough a team South Africa were and you felt that especially as a batsman. It doesn't feel like an easy win when you are out there. You have to be on from ball one and we were. We knew it would tough on day one but we thought the cracks would come in. Mitchell is at the top of his game, he's fit and strong and his execution is perfect. Our fielding has been outstanding over the last six months, we have high expectations and it's nice to see some results. It's about enjoying tonight and celebrating - it's not every day you beat the No. 1 side - but we have to ready for PE."
Man of the Match is Mitchell Johnson "We set the game up with our batters. We bowled really well as a team. We felt there was a little in the wicket, we saw Morne get some bounce. When plans come off it's really nice. I was very nervous and pumped up for this match, so to come out and do this is very good. I'm here to be the intimidator which is what I have done here. Now we have an extra day to get back up for it."
That just about wraps things up for the commentary team for this match. Firdose and Dan will have all the post-match analysis during the rest of the day, but from Andrew McGlashan and Alan Gardner it's goodbye for now and thanks for joining us. The second Test starts from Port Elizabeth on Thursday. We'll see you then.
59.4;W;Harris to Morkel, 1 run, OUT it's all over! What a shambolic way to finish! Morkel turned the ball off his body behind square, it was an easy single but he turned and came back for a second.

56.1;?;Siddle to Steyn, no run short over middle and leg, Steyn gets out of the way easily enough;
55.6;1;Johnson to Steyn, 1 run worked into the leg side;
55.5;1;Johnson to Philander, 1 run another short ball, 143kph, gets fended off behind square on the leg side more in self-protection than anything else...the slow-mo replay shows the bat bowing as it was struck. Great pictures.;
55.4;?;Johnson to Philander, no run very full, outside off, slower delivery at 132kph and it's jabbed to mid-off;
55.3;?;Johnson to Philander, no run stands on, or outside, leg stump and plays this to the off side;
55.2;?;Johnson to Philander, no run a touch fuller, punched off the back foot to short cover;
55.1;4b;Johnson to Philander, 4 byes more extras to the total as a bouncer keeps climbing over the top edge and evades a leaping Haddin;
54.6;W;Siddle to Peterson, OUT that's cruel. A grubber. Basically runs along the ground from a full length. Petersen is on the back foot and the ball goes under his bat to take middle. Even if he'd known that was coming there was little he would have been able to do.;Robin Peterson b Siddle 21 (26m 23b 3x4 0x6) SR: 91.3;
54.5;?;Siddle to Peterson, no run another very short bouncer, Petersen gets himself out of the line;
54.4;?;Siddle to Peterson, no run banged in very short, Petersen bails out of his pull shot as it travels over his helmet;
54.3;4;Siddle to Peterson, FOUR runs oh, terrific stroke...stands tall and drives off the back foot square through the off side;
54.2;?;Siddle to Peterson, no run nearly a catch to mid-off...he drives on the up, but the lack of timing help him and it only carried half way;
54.1;2;Siddle to Peterson, 2 runs short, which is the common approach now, and pulled in front of square;
53.6;?;Johnson to Philander, no run nasty! That jumps from a full length and strikes Philander a painful blow on the bottom hand, the fingers getting trapped against the bat handle. He winces in pain.;
53.5;?;Johnson to Philander, no run short over leg stump, 144kph, and he ducks underneath;
53.4;1;Johnson to Peterson, 1 run well played this time, doesn't quite make such an exaggerated move and flicks this from leg stump to deep square;
53.3;?;Johnson to Peterson, no run short and angled across, he tries to upper-cut it behind square but gets beaten;
53.2;2;Johnson to Peterson, 2 runs 147kph, this one is fuller, pushed across outside off and he plays this well, punching it square through the off side;
53.1;?;Johnson to Peterson, no run this flies over the top of middle stump, short of a length and Petersen is right across outside off trying to pull the ball around the corner;
52.6;1;Siddle to Peterson, 1 run latches onto this short ball, was a better height to be pull and he kept it down nicely to find deep square...the bad news for him, he has to face Johnson;
52.5;?;Siddle to Peterson, no run lovely bowling, fuller delivery outside off and it does just enough off the seam to beat the inside edge;
52.4;?;Siddle to Peterson, no run short ball over leg stump, Petersen goes for the pull and it's close to taking the glove;
52.3;?;Siddle to Peterson, no run full outside off, drives square to point;

52.1;4;Siddle to Peterson, FOUR runs let's face anyone but Mitchell...Petersen dispatches a full delivery straight down the ground with a lovely drive;
51.6;W;Johnson to de Villiers, OUT drilled and caught! Nothing can stop Johnson. He holds this one back a touch, it's a cutter, full outside off and de Villiers drives it with considerable power but straight to short cover. Sharp catch.;AB de Villiers c Smith b Johnson 48 (152m 90b 5x4 0x6) SR: 53.33;
51.5;1lb;Johnson to Peterson, 1 leg bye he's all over the shop here, getting right across his stumps and Johnson almost does him with the full delivery but Petersen just manages to get pad on the ball and it's outside the line of leg stump;
51.4;1;Johnson to de Villiers, 1 run cracking stroke for a single, a flamboyant pull from outside off but he can't quite beat mid-on who is quite deep;
51.3;?;Johnson to de Villiers, no run full outside off, left alone and bounces twice to Haddin;
51.2;1;Johnson to Peterson, 1 run 143kph, oh boy, there's no conviction in that...Petersen flapping at a short ball, trying some sort of pull shot and it lobs wide of short square leg;
51.1;1;Johnson to de Villiers, 1 run full outside off, presses forward and finds deep cover...happy to concede a single to get the other batsman on strike;
50.6;?;Lyon to Peterson, no run left alone outside off;

49.5;2;Johnson to Peterson, 2 runs fuller outside off, 148kph, runs off a thick outside edge through backward point;
49.4;4;Johnson to Peterson, FOUR runs almost! 144kph. Another short delivery, aimed at the body, forcing Peterson to play and the outside edge just clears the slips;
49.3;W;Johnson to McLaren, OUT that's gone though! Oh, what wonderful, breathless, fearsome fast bowling. Short of a length outside off this time, not quite so short as the previous ball, it climbs and McLaren is sparing at it more out of instinct. Glances the thumb of the glove through the keeper.;Ryan McLaren c ?Haddin b Johnson 6 (21m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 31.57;
49.2;?;Johnson to McLaren, no run that flew! Great take down the leg side from Haddin. Johnson doesn't really appeal, but they like it behind the batsman and Clarke reviews. Not sure it touched the glove, looks more like arm at first glance. It was a fierce bouncer, awesome pace as it climbed on an awkward angle on leg stump. Stays not out.;
49.1;?;Johnson to McLaren, no run on a length outside off, McLaren is into line behind the ball and defends;
48.6;1;Lyon to McLaren, 1 run pushed out to midwicket;

48.2;1;Lyon to McLaren, 1 run tickled down to fine leg;
48.1;1;Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run comes down, makes it into a full toss and clubs it to deep midwicket;
47.6;?;Johnson to McLaren, no run back of a length, testing the nerve, slightly wide of the stumps, though, and well played down towards backward point - that will be tea, time for McLaren to go and collect his thoughts;
47.5;?;Johnson to McLaren, no run oh crikey, he's been hit on the side of the head! Another scalding short ball, doesn't get up quite as high as McLaren thought and he ducks, takes his eye off it and is clanged on the grille, next to his right ear... He turned away slowly, then sank to his knees, holding his head;
47.4;?;Johnson to McLaren, no run goes round the wicket, slams in a beastly short ball, McLaren sways deftly underneath it;
47.3;?;Johnson to McLaren, no run press forward and defends a slower ball to the leg side;
47.2;2;Johnson to McLaren, 2 runs even quicker, 152 kays now, uses the pace well and it rebounds through mid-off for a couple;
47.1;?;Johnson to McLaren, no run Johnson is steaming through once again, 145kph and on that nasty length, rising to hit the label;

45.5;?;Johnson to McLaren, no run beaten outside off, dangling his bat out, Mitchell thought he heard a sound but at 148kph it was too quick for the new man;
45.4;W;Johnson to Duminy, OUT changes the angle, round the wicket... and Doolan has done it again! Amazing reflexes at short leg, takes it on the second attempt, Duminy can't believe it - he'd connected sweetly with a full-pitched delivery on leg stump and probably hit it well enough to get four. Instead, he's heading for the hutch, a dogged resistance curtailed. Johnson is amongst them once more, ten for the match!;Jean-Paul Duminy c Doolan b Johnson 10 (63m 60b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
45.3;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run stays in the crease and defends calmly down on to the pitch;

44.1;1;Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run length ball outside leg stump, jabbed down past short leg for one behind square;
43.6;2;Johnson to Duminy, 2 runs slightly overpitched from Mitch and Duminy seizes on it, filleting a couple through the covers off the front foot;
43.5;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run goes back and shoulders arms as a short ball sears through in the corridor outside off;
43.4;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run length delivery zanged down at 145kph on off stump, steered to backward point;

39.3;?;Siddle to Duminy, no run thinks about a single after timing a cover drive, nice high elbow and looks to have threaded it through but a good bit of fielding keeps Duminy on strike;

29.4;W;Harris to Amla, OUT what a moment! Harris' first wicket of the match. Amla, who has left so well, is drawn into pushing at this length delivery off the back foot.
