 Innings Start
Australians have come back like Champions packing Bangladesh for a paltry 148 runs. Warne had a sensational morning picking up 3 wickets off the 5 overs he bowled. Gillepie picked up 2 more wickets to finish with a 3-wicket haul on a flat track for pacers. Rajin Saleh showed some resistance playing a patient knock of 33 runs in 118 balls. Aussies have a big task in hand to chase down a target of 307 runs on a track thats keeping low at times and turning as well.
