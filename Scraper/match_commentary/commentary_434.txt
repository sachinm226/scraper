Hello and welcome to EspnCricinfo's live coverage of the warm-up match between Australia and South Africa.
Both the teams are warming up, Aussies with the fielding drills and the South African's stretching out.
1:35pm: The pitch is being rolled at the moment, a light roller is being used. There is tinge of green on the track. This is a different pitch to the earlier India game.
Only a few people in the stands, it looks deserted at the moment, hope to see more, once the game starts.
1:45pm: Splendid weather for a cricket match, around 30 degrees centigrade at the moment, hoping for a good weather through out this World Cup.
Toss: Two captains in the middle for the toss. Ponting has won the toss and still awaiting the decision.
Ian Chappell, Geoffrey Boycott, Harsha Bhogle, Sanjay Manjrekar....and $10,000 worth of prizes. Just a few reasons to play World Cup Fantasy.Play for FREE.
