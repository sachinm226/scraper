Data
Australia, after that opening stand, looked good to go beyond 200 but India have dragged it back somewhat, conceding just 23 in the last four overs bowled by Yuvraj, Zaheer and Nehra. Nevertheless, this is a challenging score but India have a line-up that bats deep, The boundaries here are shorter, and we might be in for a close game. Jadeja, if he bats, would want to make amends. He bowled a horror spell, and dropped Watson early in his innings. Join us in ten minutes for the chase.

9.28am We're through with Jana Gana Mana and Advance Australia Fair. Shane Watson and David Warner are about to make their way out, the Indians are in a huddle.
Nitin Kesarwani: "Here back in India, census 2011 is underway. So, Government requested Tendulkar to join twitter, just to cross check their numbers."
Karan Kapoor: "India are doing a mistake by not playing the extra pacer in form of Vinay Kumar on a pace friendly track. Australians are very good players of spin and the part time Indian spinners might pay heavily.Some pre-match formalities to complete. Children walking out with flags, and the players will soon line up for the national anthems.
Jack takes a dig at the IPL: "Now this is something I would have liked to watch, rather than 6 weeks of IAL (Indian Ads League). Why didn't anybody in Oz bid for this?"
Been following the UK elections closely? Phil sends us this: "A royal ding dong expected in Barbados and we expect a similar political one in the UK where we have a hung parliament." Yes, the battle for the next PM is under way now.
9.13am Some sporting updates from the South Pacific - Kris Kumar: "Indian born in Fiji, lived in NZ, now in Oz....News from South Pacific...Hurricanes won Super 14 match vs Reds...Kiwis lost to Australia in Rugby League...Hopefully India win.."

9.00am Toss - MS Dhoni has won the toss and decided to field. "Early morning start, a bit of swing for the fast bowlers," says Dhoni. Gautam Gambhir in place of Dinesh Karthik, Rohit Sharma comes in for Piyush Chawla. Zaheer Khan takes Praveen Kumar's place in the XI. Mitchell Johnson replaces Ryan Harris for Australia.
8.50am local Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the Super Eights game between India and Australia being played in Barbados. Contests between these two teams have always been big billings, and rest assured each will have plenty of support in the stands. It's Sid Talya taking you through the commentary for this game. We still have ten minutes left for the toss, so read the preview in the meantime. Most of you will be aware that Praveen Kumar has been ruled out of the World Twenty20, and Umesh Yadav has taken his place in the squad. The Australians will be hoping Mitchell Johnson is back to full fitness.
 Innings Start
India have been completely outplayed today, with Rohit Sharma and Harbhajan Singh being their only saving grace. We'll get you the presentation details in a bit.
Dhoni: "It started with a couple of overs that went for 40-odd runs. Watson and Warner batted very well and took the game away from us. We did well in the end to restrict them to 180. Most of the teams bowl short to us. Maybe we can leave the deliveries initially. It's important to win the two remaining games, and the run-rate will take care of itself."
Clarke: "We continued the momentum after the openers gave us a good start. These conditions helped our fast bowlers a lot more. Our plan worked today, we'll continue to adapt to different teams we play. You've got to continue to win in this tournament."
Warner is the Man of the Match
Warner: "We started it out from the beginning, and there were some big shots. We were 160 in the 16th over, but we felt what we got was enough with the pace on the wicket. There was some bounce and carry, and even Smith got a bit of turn."
That's all we have from here folks. Thanks for tuning in and sending us your feedback. It's goodbye for now. But before you sign off, check this out:
