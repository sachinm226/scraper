3.15pm: It's been a good half an hour for Andrew Tye - he's just been sold for $1.1m in the IPL auction
2.55pm So that's the end of that. England have a decent total on the board, but significantly less than they would have envisaged at 151 for 2 in the 26th over. But Andrew Tye's exceptional variations unpicked their set batsmen, and failed to let the new ones settle. After looking all at sea at 3-0 down, Australia are suddenly well placed to finish the series on a high. Back in 30 for the chase.
Himanshu: "I don't know if that's even justified but had the English batsman shown 1 percent of the grit and determination shown by both South African and Indian batsmen in the recently finished Bullring test, especially on that devil surface, they'd have at least played their 50 overs. Poor finish to a wonderful start!" Fair point, but not sure 150 for 2 in 50 overs would have helped England's cause. Test and one-day cricket are poles apart at present ...
James B: "I realise that aggressive hitting is their bit but some utterly mindless batting from England here. From 2 for 140 after 23.2 they would have eyed 330 to 350. But 8 for 119 in 24.2 followed. I understand the aggression usually works but I'd say they left 30 or so out there by not electing to reign it in a bit and bat out the overs. Should have made 300 plus from that start. Tough to judge a new pitch but I'd say Australia in front. "
47.4;W;Tye to Ball, OUT well bowled! And that is five for Tye! Yorker, straight and true, rattles the timbers, and England's innings has come to an ignominious end;Jake Ball b Tye 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
47.3;?;Tye to Ball, no run well bowled, beats the edge with good carry through to the keeper;
47.2;1;Tye to Tom Curran, 1 run slapped into the leg side;
47.1;W;Tye to Root, OUT smashed high and hard, but not high enough! In the slot once again, Root got underneath his shot, much like Roy before him, and picks out the man right back on the fence;Joe Root c Warner b Tye 62 (68b 2x4 0x6) SR: 91.17;
46.6;1;Starc to Root, 1 run short, pulled down into the leg side, Root scampers, and just beats the shy as it comes in from midwicket;

46.4;6;Starc to Tom Curran, SIX runs exceptional batting, planted over the keeper's head with a total inversion of the stance! Nailed it;

45.5;1;Tye to Root, 1 run flipped into the leg side;
45.4;W;Tye to Willey, OUT a mow over the leg side, and another catch in the deep! And was that another Tye slower ball? Certainly looked as though Willey was through his shot early, flapping the ball much squarer than he might have intended. This is a fine collective bowling effort from Australia, and England just can't get any momentum back into their innings;David Willey c Marsh b Tye 2 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;

43.6;1;Tye to Root, 1 run slower bouncer, pulled out to midwicket;

43.4;1;Tye to Root, 1 run nudged off the hip;
43.3;3;Tye to Rashid, 3 runs a bottom-handed bunt inches short of long-on! Perfectly placed, in the end;
43.2;?;Tye to Rashid, no run a dot-ball in the end, as Rashid gets in a tangle trying to manipulate the angles;
43.1;?;Tye to Rashid, no run low full toss, clipped to midwicket and Starc does well to save four overthrows as the shy comes in;

42.4;1;Hazlewood to Root, 1 run heaved out through backward square, Root gives it some bottom-handed heft;
42.3;4;Hazlewood to Root, FOUR runs short and wide, slapped high and hard, and just eludes third man! The ball ricochets off the spreadeagled fielder and over the rope, and that is Root's fifty as well.;

42.1;1;Hazlewood to Root, 1 run short and hauled out through the leg side;
41.6;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run nudged into the leg side;

41.2;?;Zampa to Rashid, no run leaning forward to defend;
41.2;1w;Zampa to Rashid, 1 wide drifting down the leg side. But at least there is drift. Makes him a particular threat;

39.4;W;Zampa to Ali, OUT that's a very soft dismissal from Moeen! Down the track, losing his shape, a wellied drive in the air to cover, and England's hopes of their habitual 300-plus total are looking bleak all of a sudden;Moeen Ali c Tye b Zampa 6 (12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
39.3;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run hauled out through square leg;
39.2;1;Zampa to Ali, 1 run sensible nudge down to long-on;
39.1;1;Zampa to Root, 1 run worked into the covers;
38.6;1;Starc to Root, 1 run eased down the ground to keep the strike;
38.5;1;Starc to Ali, 1 run flicked into the leg side, and dozy running from Moeen! Ball-watching as Smith's shy comes in from midwicket, and he'd have been gone with a direct hit;
38.5;1w;Starc to Ali, 1 wide down the leg side. Was there some bat or pad on that? Very tight to the body either way;
38.4;1;Starc to Root, 1 run a round-house pull, out to deep midwicket;
38.3;?;Starc to Root, no run round the wicket, very full, attacking the base of the stumps and gathered at mid-on;

36.4;1;Tye to Root, 1 run tucks the single to get off strike;
36.3;2;Tye to Root, 2 runs another short ball, perhaps Root thought that was it for the over, but it doesn't get up, and a steepling top-edge lands safe! He got out in that fashion at Adelaide ... a key let-off, perhaps;
36.3;1w;Tye to Root, 1 wide short, aggressive, but rather harshly judged as a wide,;

34.6;W;Tye to Buttler, OUT full, and Buttler holes out to mid-off! That's a critical breakthrough for Australia, Warner back-pedals to complete the catch, and once again, Tye's slower ball draws out the miscue from a well-set batsman;Jos Buttler c Warner b Tye 21 (25b 1x4 1x6) SR: 84;
34.5;1;Tye to Root, 1 run swinging into the toes, and tucked behind square. A bread-and-butter single;
34.4;?;Tye to Root, no run back of a length, rises sharply as Root rocks back into the pull but can't time the shot. Indicates that it is a bit two-paced;

32.6;1w;Tye to Buttler, 1 wide short, too short, over the shoulder and out stretch the umpire's arms;
32.5;1;Tye to Root, 1 run dabbed into the off side and through they jog. Root can rest up at the non-striker's end for a moment;
32.5;1w;Tye to Root, 1 wide off line;
32.4;?;Tye to Root, no run climbing into the pull and thumped under the ribcage! Ouch, that's going to hurt. No dissimilar to Pietersen's cracked rib against McGrath in the 2006-07 tour. Hopefully no lasting damage on this occasion;

28.4;1;Marsh to Root, 1 run leg side, worked off the hip down to fine leg;
28.3;W;Marsh to Morgan, OUT this one carries, though - slashed over point and Stoinis takes a smart grab running in off the rope! Another low score in a poor series for the captain, he was trying to come down as Marsh dug in a 139kph delivery, Morgan off his feet as he swiped and perish in the deep;Eoin Morgan c Stoinis b Marsh 3 (10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30;
28.2;1;Marsh to Root, 1 run banged in and Root top-edges his pull, shouts of "catch!" but it doesn't carry down to fine leg;

26.1;W;Marsh to Hales, OUT short ball, Hales tries to wallop it over square leg... but skews a top edge to point! Think that deflected off the helmet, Australia have used his head and Marsh breaks the stand. There's pace in this deck, seemed to surprise Hales and he top-edged it straight into the badge;Alex Hales c Maxwell b Marsh 35 (47b 3x4 1x6) SR: 74.46;

12.6;2;Zampa to Bairstow, 2 runs chopped through third man and they scamper back for the second;

12.4;?;Zampa to Bairstow, no run nurdled out to the leg side;
12.3;?;Zampa to Bairstow, no run poked back down the pitch, a touch of drift through the air to help the deception in flight;

12.1;1;Zampa to Hales, 1 run pushed to leg;

11.5;?;Tye to Hales, no run solid defence outside off stump;
11.4;1;Tye to Bairstow, 1 run tip and run and a single into the covers;
11.3;W;Tye to Roy, OUT battered high in the air, and Hazlewood circles at mid-on to gather a steepling miscue! The knuckleball does the trick, Roy was deceived by the change of pace, was through his shot too soon, and an aggressive if at times streaky innings comes to an end;Jason Roy c Hazlewood b Tye 49 (46b 7x4 1x6) SR: 106.52;
11.2;?;Tye to Roy, no run ripping delivery, and there's a clear snick as the ball bounces through to the keeper! But no appeal at all, curious. Seemed to miss everything...;

10.6;?;Zampa to Bairstow, no run striding onto the front foot, and punched to cover;
10.5;2;Zampa to Bairstow, 2 runs back and across, whipped into the leg side, and Bairstow gallops back for a non-existent second. He's brisk!;

7.3;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run cracked into the covers;
7.2;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run that's a good leave, or a brave one. Grazes past the stumps with the angle bringing the ball back into the right hander;
7.1;1;Hazlewood to Roy, 1 run blocked into the leg side, another quick single;
6.6;?;Marsh to Bairstow, no run inswing, and struck on the pad... there's an appeal, not especially vociferous it has to be said, and Smith declines the review after a brief consultation;

6.4;?;Marsh to Roy, no run leaning forward and defended back down the pitch;

5.6;4;Hazlewood to Bairstow, FOUR runs under-edged drive, past the leg stump and that's four more through fine leg. Bairstow is up and away with a bit of good fortune;
5.5;4;Hazlewood to Bairstow, FOUR runs fipped off the toes, no real timing but as previously mentioned, this outfield is a belter. Two men give chase, but they can't haul it in;

5.1;1;Hazlewood to Roy, 1 run defended down into the crease, Bairstow is alert and jogs through for the single;
4.6;1;Starc to Roy, 1 run full length, looked like a slower ball, tapped to mid-on to steal a single, and the strike. Poor old Jonny is just a spectator at present;
4.5;4;Starc to Roy, FOUR runs on the pads, flicked out through midwicket, and timed to perfection. Roy is racing!;
4.4;?;Starc to Roy, no run crunched on the up, out to cover;
4.3;4;Starc to Roy, FOUR runs battered through the line, hit on the up, very Graham Gooch in outlook, if I may say so. Clean through mid-on;

4.1;1;Starc to Bairstow, 1 run angled bat, down into the ground, through third man;
3.6;4;Hazlewood to Roy, FOUR runs flogged! Much more power and intent this time, a full-blooded fling of the hands, into the line of the ball and away through the covers. Roy is ticking;
3.5;4;Hazlewood to Roy, FOUR runs onto the front foot, compactly stabbed through mid-off, where Warner fails to intercept. That races to the rope;
3.4;?;Hazlewood to Roy, no run lift off the deck, over the top of the stumps. I said I'd reserve judgement on this new ground until I'd seen the pitch. I rather like the look of it so far...;
3.3;?;Hazlewood to Roy, no run less dramatic carry this time as Roy leaves alone;
3.2;4b;Hazlewood to Roy, 4 byes a bouncing bomb of a delivery! Outside off, swinging away, and exploding off the seam and over Paine's gloves! That's WACA-worthy carry!;
3.1;1;Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 run outside off, nudged down through third man to get Bairstow off the mark;
2.6;?;Starc to Roy, no run a free hit and a free swing of the bat, but no contact through to the keeper;
2.6;1nb;Starc to Roy, (no ball) and that is the end of that! Outside off, Roy is caught on the crease, takes the edge, a fine diving catch from Paine behind the stumps, in front of first slip but hang on ... it's a no-ball!;
2.5;6;Starc to Roy, SIX runs wallop! Roy plants the front foot, as if pre-meditating the fuller length after Starc's error the previous ball. Flings the bat through the line and all the way over long-off!;
2.4;4;Starc to Roy, FOUR runs short, and hauled through the leg side! So quick to capitalise on bowler error, that sat up and begged;
2.3;?;Starc to Roy, no run outside off, nibble off the seam as the ball bursts past the edge again. Roy is playing with circumspection so far, have England been chastised by their calamity in Adelaide?;
2.2;?;Starc to Roy, no run back of a length, punched on the up into the covers;
2.1;?;Starc to Roy, no run tight line from over the wicket, blocked back down the pitch on the front foot;

 Innings Start
7.45pm: Well, that was fun. Dan Brettig's report will colour in the day for you, a Perth scorcher to finish the series. Elsewhere, the IPL auction has just about wrapped up, with Chris Gayle, the Universe Boss himself, among the late buys. Anyway, from Miller and myself, thanks for your contributions... We'll be back for more when the T20s start next weekend. Laters!
7.35pm: Presentations time, Tom Curran is Man of the Match: "Watching the boys play one-day cricket recently has been a pleasure and to come in and try and take my chance is a great feeling. I've been training hard, to come and play the first ODI at this unbelievable stadium, in front the Barmy Army... the game was unbelievable, what a finish."
Joe Root is named Player of the Series: "I think we thoroughly enjoyed these one-day games, to come back [after the Ashes] how we have shows the character in the group. We've been together for a while, the same guys around the team, clear idea of your role in the side and we have continuity and from there consistency. You've always got to think you're in the game, trying to take wickets. We weren't probably at our best but we came through. [Break now?] Yeah, won't overdo things, come back strong for NZ."
Australia captain Steven Smith: "We thought we'd pulled it back really well, but we didn't start as well with the ball, been a bit of trend. We thought it was very chaseable, but again we lost wickets in clumps and you can't do that against a quality England line-up. [Andrew Tye?] He bowled well, hit a good length and bowled his change-ups, but our batting again wasn't good enough. These lapses are happening way too often in one-day cricket. [Stadium?] It was magnificent, the crowd, the pitched played really well and the outfield was lightning, hope we'll lots more good games of cricket here. [Time for a rest?] It's been a long summer, I haven't been as good in this format, and we've been outplayed, they thoroughly deserved to win."
England captain Eoin Morgan: "Really special, I thought we'd played particularly poorly for much of the game but when we got on top we made it count. In the Adelaide game, we had them seven down, so we knew to fight to the end. There have been a lot of positives, a lot of fight through the series. The ball started going a bit reverse, that was the feedback we got from practice games, the ball chews up. Tom Curran, to bowl a spell like that, for such a young guy, it's a great sign. [Squad selection] We're spoiled for choice, guys are fighting for positions, it's a special group of players that are very talented. To win while we're learning is extra special. A huge thank you to everyone who's come today, they've been great. [Barmy Army] It's been a long few months but we always appreciate their support."
7.25pm: Well, well. A 12-run win for England gives them the series 4-1, equalling Australia's heaviest ODI defeat on home soil. Both teams found it harder and harder to score as the innings wore on, but England's adrenaline-infused first half and an Australia collapse of 6 for 58 tipped the balance. It was a thoroughly enjoyable first outing for Perth's new venue, although without the hoped-for result (from a home perspective)... And a big performance from Tom Curran, too. I wonder if there's still time for an IPL franchise to take note?
"Will we get the inflatable four fingers up for this ending?" wonders Simon. I suspect England might get a hand gesture or two...
"You asked, what has Curran got?" hoots Mahota. "Well he has got the MoM."
Robert Brown: "Good on ya Moeen Ali, now you whingers - he took 3 wickets, he's the man"

44.5;?;Willey to Zampa, no run over the wicket, full and straight, hit on the toe - given! Zampa calls for the review, as he has to... Just a matter of where it pitched, from the looks of it, maybe a touch leg side... Yes, pitched outside leg, so the decision is overturned! Cheers of relief around the ground, Zampa survives!;

43.4;4;Ball to Zampa, FOUR runs width and slashed towards third man, where Moeen is wrong-footed by the spin and it skips for four! Poor fielding and it gifts a vital boundary to the Australia cause;

33.5;1;Rashid to Maxwell, 1 run flighted, worked into the leg side for one;
