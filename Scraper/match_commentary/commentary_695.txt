Data
After their wham-bam approach against South Africa yesterday, the Bangladesh innings has been a complete anti-climax. They shelved their natural instincts at the start and never gained any momentum. They had plenty of wickets to make a late charge but Lee's hat-trick, the first in Twenty20 internationals, put paid to those hopes.
Incidentally, Lee is the only bowler to have hat-tricks in both limited overs formats. His ODI feat came against Kenya in the 2003 World Cup, in Durban.
Australia need 124 to win, join us in ten minutes for their chase.

13.45: We're 15 minutes away from the start. To keep you occupied, here's a piece on the cheerleaders
for the ICC World Twenty20. Ed Craig of the Wisden Cricketer went behind the scenes.

Pitch: The pitch appears to have a few cracks in it like for yesterday's game so the spinners will play a part. Bowlers who hit the deck will also be useful and Australia have the bowlers to do that.
13.40: Toss: News from the middle is that Ricky Ponting has won the toss and Australia will bowl first.
13.35: Weather: Unlike yesterday, I begin with good news. It's bright and sunny in Cape Town so we should start on time unless something outrageous happens. Andrew McGlashan, who probably knows Cape Town inside-out by now says the crowd is slowly building up and the stands should fill-out when the South Africa game starts. He adds,"There's a good mixture of Australian, Bangladesh, English and South African supporters in the crowd."
13.30: Teams: Both teams are unchanged from their previous games. Nazimuddin, Bangladesh's promising young opener who failed in both games, gets another chance. For Australia, there's still no place for the specialist left-arm spinner Brad Hogg so it's upto the part-timers again.
Australia 1 Adam Gilchrist (wk), 2 Matthew Hayden, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Andrew Symonds, 5 Brad Hodge, 6 Mike Hussey, 7 Michael Clarke, 8 Stuart Clark, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Nathan Bracken, 11 Mitchell Johnson
Bangladesh 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Nazimuddin, 3 Aftab Ahmed, 4 Mohammad Ashraful (capt), 5 Shakib Al Hasan, 6 Alok Kapali, 7 Farhad Reza, 8 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 9 Mashrafe Mortaza, 10 Syed Rasel, 11 Abdur Razzak
13.25 local time: Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the Super Eights match between Australia and Bangladesh at Newlands. This is Kanishkaa Balachandran and I will take you through the first half of the innings. George Binoy will take over later and we have the pleasure of bringing you the first match of the double-header in Cape Town. The England- South Africa clash follows later.
Both teams will cast their minds back to the one-dayer in Cardiff two years ago when Bangladesh stunned Australia. It will be interesting to see if Bangladesh temper their aggression a little early on and ensure they play out 20 overs and push the score to 200 and thereabouts. They're up against the best in the world so that will take some getting.
 Innings Start
The game was over as a contest after the Australians restricted Bangladesh to 123. Brett Lee became the first bowler to take a Twenty20 hat-trick and all the other bowlers bowled a superb line and length to keep Bangladesh on a leash. Bangladesh's batsmen were very disappointing after their break-neck start against South Africa yesterday.
A target of 124 was never going to Test Australia and Hayden top-scored with an unbeaten 73. Brett Lee is the Man of the Match for his hat-trick.
Thank you all for your emails today. This is George Binoy signing off for the evening. Cheers.
