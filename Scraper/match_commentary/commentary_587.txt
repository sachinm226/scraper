29.3;?;Edwards to Symonds, no run back of a length outside off, hint of swing, Symonds pushes to point;
29.3;5w;Edwards to Symonds, 5 wide another bouncer over his shoulder, deviates further and even Ramdin cannot leap high enough to stop it and that's signalled wides to fine leg ... untidy;
29.2;?;Edwards to Symonds, no run tidy stuff, short of a length and Symonds gets back and across to block;
29.1;W;Edwards to Katich, OUT and it works a charm, does the change! Edwards steams in and hustles Katich with a bouncer which rears onto him, getting him late onto the pull shot, the top-edge spirals into the air over Ramdin, three men give chase but Gayle from first slip calls for it and does excellently to take it down near the ropes, he seems to have hurt himself in the process but that's a neat catch to give Windies a fifth wicket;Simon Katich c Gayle b Edwards 36 (129m 72b 5x4 0x6) SR: 50;
28.6;?;Bravo to Symonds, no run back of a length outside off and wide too so he shoulders arms;

26.1;1;Bravo to Symonds, 1 run on middle and leg and worked to midwicket for a sharp single;
25.6;?;Gayle to Katich, no run fired in on off stump and he squirts it towards point;
25.5;?;Gayle to Katich, no run pads one away not too far outside off stump but Dar shakes his head, appeared to be the arm ball and it got West Indies excited ... not sure you want to pad stuff away;
25.4;1;Gayle to Symonds, 1 run sucks him forward again and this time there's an edge past slip to raise Australia's 100 just after the break;
25.3;?;Gayle to Symonds, no run quicker one gets Symonds onto the front foot again, defending;
25.2;?;Gayle to Symonds, no run changes the angle, bowls it full and Symonds strides in to defend;

24.3;?;Bravo to Symonds, no run defended on the front foot;
24.2;?;Bravo to Symonds, no run oh! Got him! Ah, not got him! Symonds manages to play all around the inside of that one, if that makes sense, drawing his bat just inside the line on the back foot, and he just hadn't quite edged it;

23.2;?;Gayle to Katich, no run defended hard on the front foot, right over it;
23.1;?;Gayle to Katich, no run the slower slow delivery, if that makes sense, Katich watches it all the way through to Ramdin's gloves;
22.6;W;Bravo to Clarke, OUT second wicket of the over! Clarke goes to a really good delivery which had him reaching away from his body as it pitched outside off and moved wider and a thick enough snick deviates on to the keeper;Michael Clarke c ?Ramdin b Bravo 0 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
22.5;?;Bravo to Clarke, no run width outside off, the ball pitches wide and moves wider, the batsman shouldering arms;

20.5;?;Bravo to Hussey, no run defended hard on the front foot;

16.1;W;Taylor to Ponting, OUT big shout and he's gone! Ponting has been trapped in front, Taylor hitting the pitch just in line with off, it nipped back and would have crashed into leg stump and the batsman is on his way;Ricky Ponting lbw b Taylor 18 (31m 21b 0x4 2x6) SR: 85.71;

So, Ponting had a life last over but couldn't make West Indies pay and he returns to the pavilion. He, like Jaques, had been in attacking form, but they have both perished. West Indies are cock-a-hoop, proceedings swinging this way and that already. Here's Hussey now
 Innings Start
16:21 Thats a Test-best 4 for 41 for Johnson. He's come back very well after a poor morning. Australia have bowled West Indies out for 216 in 58.5 overs, which means they lead by 35. Poor stuff from the home side, losing six wickets for 49 runs in the last session. Chanderpaul stands alone on an unbeaten 79. Perhaps had he thrown the bat around with the last man in, West Indies could have got closer to Australia's 251. Never mind that now, we are moments from Australia's second innings.
58.5;W;Johnson to Edwards, OUT and it works first ball, swinging it into Edwards, who plays a loose drive and the thick outside-edge is snapped up by Ponting at second slip rather easily;Fidel Edwards c Ponting b Johnson 1 (26m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 9.09;

57.4;?;Lee to Chanderpaul, no run gets back and drives this one off the back foot to Clarke at cover;

57.1;1;Lee to Edwards, 1 run good shot to open up, tucking one off the pads to deep square leg;

53.5;W;Lee to Powell, OUT and he goes pulling another short ball that goes down the stumps, there's the thinnest of sounds and it appears ball brushed glove through to Haddin behind the stumps;Daren Powell c ?Haddin b Lee 9 (6m 6b 2x4 0x6) SR: 150;
53.4;?;Lee to Powell, no run cuts him in half, jagging back off a short length and Powell does well to arch his back and withdraw the loosely-hanging bat just in time;
53.3;4;Lee to Powell, FOUR runs full this time, some swing into Powell, but he's flicked over midwicket;
53.2;?;Lee to Powell, no run sparred into his chest and he hops to awkwardly defend it to Lee;
53.1;4;Lee to Powell, FOUR runs but he's happy to play his shots, pulling a short ball handsomely;
52.6;1;Johnson to Powell, 1 run pitches on leg, clipped to square leg, there's confusion but alls well;
52.5;W;Johnson to Benn, OUT finally Johnson gets some more reward. Probes outside off and Benn tries to drive off the back foot and gets a thin edge through the Haddin, who doesn't make a mistake.;Sulieman Benn c ?Haddin b Johnson 3 (14m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 21.42;

52.2;?;Johnson to Benn, no run outside off stump and left alone;

51.2;1;Lee to Chanderpaul, 1 run pushed to the vacant mid off and Chanderpaul happy to take a single and expose Benn to Lee;
51.1;?;Lee to Chanderpaul, no run down leg side, perhaps off Chanderpaul's pad and Haddin can't snaffle it cleanly;

50.5;?;Johnson to Benn, no run short, Benn sways out of the way;
50.4;?;Johnson to Benn, no run dropped! Katich again! Benn edges a simple chance to Katich at first slip and he just can't hold onto them. Really simple stuff, the Australians are missing Hayden in that spot;

49.5;?;Clarke to Taylor, no run flatter ball this time, Taylor works it behind point and what's this?

48.1;W;Johnson to Ramdin, OUT magnificent catch! Johnson angles it across Ramdin, who tries to guide it down between slips and gully. The ball bounced a bit more than Ramdin expected and he battled to keep it down, Clarke at gully dived forward and to his left to snare a super catch;Denesh Ramdin c Clarke b Johnson 1 (16m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 8.33;

44.3;W;Johnson to Bravo, OUT and Johnson gets a much-needed wicket! It's a leg-side catch behind, Johnson gave Bravo one on his hips and an attempted glance ran through to Haddin.

96.3;?;Powell to Hussey, no run more defence;

Powell back in to the attack
 Innings Start
We hope you've enjoyed our coverage. From me, Will Luke, along with Brydon Coverdale, Jenny Thompson, Andrew McGlashan, Jamie Alter - and probably others, too - it's goodbye.
Sherwin Campbell is issuing the Man-of-the-Match award, and hands it to Simon Katich. He gets US$3,000 and heads off his with his cheque, oblivious to the fact people actually want to talk to him
"Yeah look," he starts, "if Matty Hayden was playing I'd probably have been carrying the drinks. It was just nice to get an opportunity. The wickets have been very good to bat on and get a few runs in the second Test and here. Well, obviously if Matty gets fit he'll get back in. He's a champion. I love playing here, and it's been great being apart of it.
"Yeah, obviously I didn't get this for my fielding."
More boos for Ponting, and a dreadful reception for the umpires too. They look a bit sheepish and confused.
Boos ring out for Ponting! Poor old chap. "There's been some great Test cricket played, and West Indies...the way they attacked the run chase showed a lot of heart and character."
On retirements and the like. A period of transition. "We've been going through it a while now. We had a few retire then. Losing Gilly, Stewy, it's given the younger guys to show what they've got. Look at Katich - he's been terrific, and Jaques bounces back. They've all played their part."
Presentation time. Hope you're still with us.
Here's Gayle. "Congratulations to Ricky and his team. Well done to all our guys, but unfortunately we came out on the losing side. I can't fault them for the effort they put in. To get 387 was pretty good."
Did he genuinely think West Indies had a chance of winning? "Yeah definitely but we knew it wasn't going to be easy. Someone had to get a big hundred which didn't happen."
Twenty20: "We'll have some new faces. We'll be looking for them to capitalise and take their chances and make the best of it."
And Australia win by 87 runs, winning the series 2-0. A disappointed Edwards and Powell trudge off the pitch while Australia hug and congratulate themselves like royal winners. Ponting leads them off the park, and they all shake hands and generally enjoy the moment.
Well it was a great attempt by West Indies. Bravo and Chanderpaul had Australia sweating at one point, with a stand of 122, but both departed in quick succession. The tail offered a bit of last-gasp entertainment, if not genuine hope, but Australia's bowlers were tight enough to seal the win.
