Data
6.10 pm Sri Lanka have finished with 238, a score that is less than par on this pitch. They were set for at least 40 more when Sangakkara and Chandimal were steering the innings. But they fell away after that partnership. Christian wrecked the innings with a hat-trick and finished with 5 for 31. Pattinson was making a comeback from injury and he took four wickets as well.
So Sri Lanka need to keep Australia to 238 or less to make the finals. I'll be back in 30 minutes for the chase.

18.2;4;Hilfenhaus to Sangakkara, FOUR runs short of a length with a little width, that's all Sangakkara needs. He slaps the ball with power off the front foot through cover;

17.5;4;Watson to Chandimal, FOUR runs that's not short, but Chandimal moves slightly towards the off and heaves the ball with a short-arm pull off the front foot. He hit it flat and in the air between midwicket and mid-on. Chandimal is a little bundle of class.;

16.5;1;Hilfenhaus to Sangakkara, 1 run Sangakkara moves forward, pushes towards mid-on and runs immediately, the fielder doesn't pick up cleanly;

 Innings Start
10.25 pm Sri Lanka needed to prevent Australia from winning to make the finals of the triangular series. They were on course for a huge total before the middle and lower order failed and they finished on 238. Mahela Jayawardene then lost two bowlers, Perera to a side strain and Mathews to a calf injury. He kept his nerve and maintained attacking fields throughout to lead his team to a superb victory. They have qualified for the final on top of the league. A few days ago they were shredded by Virat Kohli, how well they have recovered.
A word about this crowd today. The Sri Lankans turned up in large numbers and made themselves heard. There was music, dancing and a lot of good cheer. More than one person compared the atmosphere to what you'd find at the Premadasa.
Prabhakaran: "I am an Indian, but I feel Sri Lanka deserved to go to the final. They have really fought hard and earned their place in the final."
Watson: "A brilliant game of cricket ... you never knew who was going to win. Dave Hussey batted beautifully, as he's shown through the summer so far." Watson backs Hussey decision not to run the single off the second last ball off the 49th over. "I back his judgement."
Watson says he's sure Clarke will be fit for Sunday's first of three finals.
Dinesh Chandimal is the Man of the Match for his half-century. He's the top scorer of the series, and batted with admirable temperament today after Sri Lanka had lost two early wickets. He scored briskly, taking pressure of Sangakkara, and kept Sri Lanka going.
Jayawardene: "The boys showed character [to bounce back after the defeat to India]. Fantastic support, it's like playing in Sri Lanka. We lifted our game. I'm sure the crowd will follow us now, the lift that we got [from them], it pushed us in the last few overs.
Jayawardene's voice is hoarse, he's been screaming his head off no doubt. He says it's too early to be sure about the status of the injured players - Perera, Mathews and Maharoof. He gives credit to Sanga and Dilshan for helping him tactically on the field.
It's been quite a game. I hope you enjoyed following it as much as I did bringing it to you. Thank you for all the emails. Cheers.
49.1;W;Kulasekara to Hussey, OUT Sri Lanka have won! Hussey has been caught at long off, and listen to the MCG erupt! Mahela Jayawardene is ecstatic.

0.2;1w;Malinga to Wade, 1 wide that is a harsh call for wide outside off stump, it wasn't outside those guiding tram lines;
0.1;2;Malinga to Wade, 2 runs Malinga begins with a low leg-stump full toss that is clipped off the pads towards deep backward square leg;

I wonder what the Indians are doing now. They will know in a few hours whether they need to head to the airport tomorrow or not. Sri Lanka need to tie or win to make the finals. They have 238 to defend.
Kalyan: "Can Malinga seek redemption by making up for what he did in the last match?" Well his search for it begins now. He has the new ball. Wade and Warner are Australia's openers.
