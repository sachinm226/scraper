So Australia will need 300 to win the match and seal the series. England started and finished well but again a mid-innings stumble cost them. It's a very good wicket and the outfield is swift so Australia should back themselves to do it. England, remember, only have three frontline bowlers. Peter English will have a bulletin to tell you more and during the break have a look at our ESPNcricinfo Innovation Series, in partnership with SAAB, which is a ten-part weekly feature that examines the key developments that helped shape the modern game. Week one looks back the first edition of the Cricket World Cup.

49.5;1;Hussey to Yardy, 1 run this is shoved in very short and Yardy should have got more, in the end he belted a pull shot to deep midwicket. Leaves Tremlett to try and bring up the 300;
49.4;4;Hussey to Yardy, FOUR runs Yardy is down the wicket, giving himself some room and drives excellently down the ground and times it well enough to run for four;
49.3;W;Hussey to Shahzad, OUT Hussey gets another! What figures he has. Shahzad mistimes a full toss and it loops to midwicket who takes a very gentle chance;Ajmal Shahzad c Watson b Hussey 4 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80;
49.2;1;Hussey to Yardy, 1 run this is horridly timed down the ground, trickling to long-on;
49.1;4;Hussey to Yardy, FOUR runs excellent shot from Yardy, really top stuff. Down the wicket and giving himself room to drive into a gap wide of long-off for four. This is turning into an unlikely gem of an innings;
48.6;1;Watson to Yardy, 1 run Yardy's lack of timing saves him here as the drive goes one-bounce to deepish mid-off;
48.5;1;Watson to Shahzad, 1 run flicked airily, but straight to mid-on;
48.4;1;Watson to Yardy, 1 run Yardy down on one knee trying to poke a sweep fine but gets too much of it and it goes to fine leg;

47.6;W;Hussey to PD Collingwood, OUT Collingwood tries to repeat the sweep/heave that got the boundary earlier, this time he timed it too well and it went straight to White who made no mistake this time. Ends an ugly innings but at least it showed signs of form;Paul Collingwood c White b Hussey 27 (37m 27b 2x4 1x6) SR: 100;

46.3;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood again advances before trying to sweep/ramp it over short midwicket, the slower ball meant he was through it long before it arrived;

46.1;?;Watson to Yardy, no run Yardy down the wicket and throwing his arms at the ball, doesn't time it at all and it trickles to cover. England though about a single but there was none there;

41.1;W;Hussey to Morgan, OUT Hussey gets his second! Morgan's reverse-sweep was timed well but straight to point, who jumped high to take the chance above his head.

16.2;1;Hastings to Trott, 1 run nudged on the off side off the back foot;

14.2;1;Lee to Trott, 1 run good god! what a mess that was, terrible cricket all around, both batsmen find themselves at the same end after a huge mix-up, Australia still manage to not get the run-out, Trott blocks the ball from Lee and he's not sure where that went, he turns round to see it round in front of middle stump and has his back to the non-striker as the ball nestles between middle and off stump after rolling gently back, Prior was charging down the track, no idea why he was, Lee races towards the ball, collides with Trott at the batsman's crease, and bowler, batsman and non-striker were all at the striker's end, Lee manages to get the ball after a couple of collisions with Trott, he has loads of time to throw the ball to the other end and get the run-out, he fires in the throw wide though and the fielder at the non-striker's end couldn't collect it and Trott heaves a sigh of relief, as does Prior;

11.6;?;Hastings to Trott, no run pushed straight to cover again;

11.2;1;Hastings to Trott, 1 run Trott gives himself room and mistimes a drive to cover;
11.1;1;Hastings to Prior, 1 run ooh, Prior tries to work to third man but the slower ball means it's a bottom edge that bounces over the stumps and Haddin's head;
10.6;2;Watson to Trott, 2 runs good offcutter around off stump and Trott clamps down to run it to third man;
10.5;1;Watson to Prior, 1 run again Watson is on the pads, desperate not to give Prior width outside off - Prior works it with his wrists to leg;
10.4;2;Watson to Prior, 2 runs wrong line from Watson around leg stump, Prior tries to whip it but gets more edge than middle;
10.3;1;Watson to Trott, 1 run Trott flicks rather expansively but only for single to fine leg;
10.2;?;Watson to Trott, no run little bit short and a little bit wide and the cut shot finds point;
10.1;?;Watson to Trott, no run Watson lands a straight ball that Trott tries to whip to leg but misses;
9.6;?;Hastings to Prior, no run this time it's pushed firmly to cover;
9.5;2;Hastings to Prior, 2 runs Prior gets down on one knee and sweeps, risky shot, picked out short fine leg who misfields and allows a couple;

9.1;?;Hastings to Trott, no run starts fullish around off stump - tidy - and it's pushed to cover;
8.6;?;Watson to Prior, no run Watson finishes the over much better than he started it, landing it on a fuller length and off stump;
8.5;1;Watson to Trott, 1 run a hint of room outside off allows Trott to jab to third man;
8.4;1;Watson to Prior, 1 run touch too straight from Watson and Prior mistimes a drive down the ground;
8.3;1;Watson to Trott, 1 run again Watson explores Trott's pads and is predictably worked away through midwicket;
8.2;2;Watson to Trott, 2 runs better line, outside off stump and Trott aims a drive, slicing it and losing his bottom hand off the bat as he plays it. Finds a gap at cover;
8.1;4;Watson to Trott, FOUR runs wrong line again from Watson, bowling on Trott's pads with fine leg up makes no sense and Trott's flick beats the man and runs away to the boundary;

Haddin up to the stumps now, which should by noisy.
 Innings Start
Australia lead the series 3-1. Today's result has been great for the series. Three dead rubbers would have been too many in a series that already has one match too many. Peter English's bulletin has been updated. It definitely wasn't Australia's Day.
The next game is at the Gabba on January 30. Join us then. Cheers!

38.5;W;Trott to White, OUT caught! And that might be it. White decided Trott had to go and muscled a length ball towards long-on.

34.6;?;Trott to White, no run White finishes the over by pushing to cover;
34.5;W;Trott to Hussey, OUT Trott does the trick! After taking single after single, Hussey tries to beat long-off, he couldn't and ended up lofting a simple catch;David Hussey c Bell b Trott 28 (43m 34b 1x4 0x6) SR: 82.35;

32.6;?;Trott to White, no run this time he reverts to convention but timing has deserted him this innings;

32.3;1;Trott to Hussey, 1 run driven very firmly but to mid-on;

31.6;?;Yardy to White, no run waa? Moon-ball! Like Jeremy Snape. It was so, so slow and full - a full toss in fact. It should have ended up out of Adelaide but White didn't pick it up and patted it back to the bowler;

30.6;2;Trott to White, 2 runs this is hit hard down to KP on the cover boundary who makes no mistake cutting the ball off;
30.5;1;Trott to Hussey, 1 run driven again safely, but Australia need some boundaries;
30.4;1;Trott to White, 1 run full ball meets a very full face that sends the ball to long-on;
30.3;?;Trott to White, no run White tries to give himself room but Trott follows him and the slap to off isn't timed at all;
30.2;1;Trott to Hussey, 1 run fiddled into the leg side for a jogged single;

29.3;1;Tremlett to White, 1 run shortish ball is crashed to short extra cover where Bell fields superbly;
29.2;?;Tremlett to White, no run beaten again! This was a less special delivery, touch wide and White aimed a late cut and it skimmed past the edge;

28.5;?;Trott to Hussey, no run driven hard again but straight to cover;
28.4;3;Trott to White, 3 runs White has seen enough and goes for a booming drive down the ground, not perfectly timed and Luke Wright slid brilliantly to pull off a remarkable save on the long-off boundary. He really is a special(ist) fielder;
28.3;?;Trott to White, no run the lack of pace means the midwicket-clip is not firm enough;
28.2;1lb;Trott to Hussey, 1 leg bye Trott has found a decent enough line sliding into the batsman and thuds off the thigh towards square leg;
28.1;1;Trott to White, 1 run starts slow around middle and is fiddled to leg;
27.6;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run this is full again and driven with a hint of inside edge towards mid-off;
27.5;?;Tremlett to Hussey, no run fuller from Tremlett, which always seems hazardous, but the firm drive finds a tumbling Bell;

27.3;1;Tremlett to White, 1 run the batsmen trade singles as White pushes this into the off side;
27.2;1;Tremlett to Hussey, 1 run after all that fun this is worked away into space for one;
27.1;4;Tremlett to Hussey, FOUR runs starts with a pretty meek half-tracker that is pulled smartly, in front of midwicket where... OH NO! Silly KP slid to field with one hand, flicked it up but onto his own body and it bounced off over the rope. Oops;
26.6;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run a Collingwood slower ball is very slow and Hussey has to do all the work to get drive, earning a single to a deepish mid-off;
26.5;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run a firm drive is played so perfectly straight that it went into the stumps at the non-striker's end;

26.2;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run touch fuller and a leg-stump line means Hussey can tuck it away to the leg side;
26.1;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run Collingwood wobbles this onto a straight line and length and Hussey has no pace to work this into space;
25.6;?;Shahzad to White, no run big wind up from Shahzad as he was about to deliver, but it was all a deception because it's in fact slower, much slower and blocked away;
25.5;?;Shahzad to White, no run Shahzad dares fuller, looking for swing and it's carefully blocked out. Shahzad spins on his heels and swaggers back to his mark;
25.4;?;Shahzad to White, no run back on careful defence here;
25.3;2;Shahzad to White, 2 runs urgh, this is once again filthy looking from White, but effective enough as it's slugged wide of long-off;
25.2;?;Shahzad to White, no run Shahzad finds a straighter line is rewarded with a rare straight bat from White, who has played possibly the ugliest 27 balls I've ever seen. And I've watched plenty of Collingwood;
25.1;1;Shahzad to Hussey, 1 run this is slashed wide of point down to the boundary rider who scoots round to save;
24.6;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run dabbed down to third man, another single. And that's the halfway mark of the innings;

24.1;?;PD Collingwood to White, no run blocked into the covers;
23.6;W;Shahzad to Watson, OUT massive wicket! Too wide to take on, and Watson's airy swish takes a thin top edge to Prior. Now England are in the driving seat;Shane Watson c ?Prior b Shahzad 64 (99m 72b 5x4 1x6) SR: 88.88;
23.5;4;Shahzad to Watson, FOUR runs driven, in the air, but that beats the diving mid-off, and it's a very welcome boundary. They've been few and far between in recent overs;
23.4;1;Shahzad to White, 1 run banged in short, decent delivery, pulled to the midwicket sweeper;
23.3;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run outswinger this time, good variation. Nudged down to third man;
23.2;1;Shahzad to White, 1 run clear swing, angling from outside off towards middle. Met with a mow, and picked up at midwicket. That came right off the toe;
23.1;?;Shahzad to White, no run swished across the line from outside off, but can't get enough pace on the shot as mid-on fields;

22.1;?;PD Collingwood to Watson, no run great shape from Collingwood, swinging late and defended on middle-and-leg;
21.6;?;Shahzad to White, no run genuine swing that time, very full and a bit too wide, but White's wild swing finds nothing but thin air;
21.5;?;Shahzad to White, no run wide on the crease, angling in and defended with a big stride;
21.4;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run defended off the back foot, a quick call, and through they hustle;
21.3;?;Shahzad to Watson, no run more slight movement, open-faced guide to point;
21.2;2;Shahzad to Watson, 2 runs too much width, and clobbered out to deep point. A sniff of reverse swing though ...;
21.1;?;Shahzad to Watson, no run a swishing drive, back down the track but intercepted in Shahzad's followthrough;
20.6;?;PD Collingwood to White, no run defended with a shuffle on off stump. Excellent probing work from Collingwood. He's bowling like Ronnie Irani in 2002. And that's actually a compliment;
20.5;?;PD Collingwood to White, no run blatted into the covers, where Strauss fields with a juggle;
20.4;?;PD Collingwood to White, no run more appreciable nibble off the seam, and blocked once again;
20.3;?;PD Collingwood to White, no run good delivery, a fraction shorter but arrow-straight. White prods down at the last minute;
20.2;1;PD Collingwood to Watson, 1 run driven through mid-on;
20.1;?;PD Collingwood to Watson, no run driven up to cover;
19.6;2b;Yardy to White, 2 byes really wide on the crease, ends up as a low full-toss, and Prior can't do much as the ball is nutmegged between his legs. Looked as though there was bat involved, but the umpire thinks not;
19.5;?;Yardy to White, no run fuller, and straighter. Defended;
19.4;2;Yardy to White, 2 runs fuller delivery, and this one is lofted into space over mid-on. Plugs as it lands, and they jog back for two;
19.3;?;Yardy to White, no run poked into the covers, and easily fielded;
19.2;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run poor ball, but the leg-side sweeper is in place to tidy up a long-hop;
19.1;1;Yardy to White, 1 run prodded into the covers;
18.6;?;PD Collingwood to Watson, no run massive appeal as this one jags off the seam, but there looked as though there was bat involved there, and it might have been down leg. Otherwise, pretty close;
18.5;?;PD Collingwood to Watson, no run pushed out to mid-on, and well fielded with a stretch. On the spot again;
18.4;?;PD Collingwood to Watson, no run more subtle movement through to the air, and defended again;
18.3;1;PD Collingwood to White, 1 run another single down the ground, excellent rhythm from Collingwood;

18.1;1;PD Collingwood to Watson, 1 run good areas from Colly, shaping into the batsman and pushed down the ground;
17.6;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run slow, slow, slow delivery, a fraction short, but not enough pace to work with. A miscued pull dribbles out to mid-on;
17.5;1;Yardy to White, 1 run dragged down, a bit of a rank delivery to be frank, but met with a calm nudge off the pads;
17.4;?;Yardy to White, no run looped onto leg stump, and pushed to mid-on;
17.3;2;Yardy to White, 2 runs a monstrous mow into no-man's land at deep cover. A bit lucky, but gets away with it;
17.2;?;Yardy to White, no run tossed onto a good length from around the wicket, and blocked;
17.1;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run cut firmly in front of square, and there is Watto's fifty. Great effort once again;
16.6;W;PD Collingwood to Clarke, OUT cracking delivery! That one burst off the seam, nipped through the gate, and flicked the top of middle stump! Great stuff from Colly, who is justifying his place in the side once again ...;Michael Clarke b Collingwood 15 (41m 27b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
16.5;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run driven from deep in the crease, picked up at midwicket;

15.5;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run picks the gap again, but Yardy's in a good rhythm;

15.2;?;Yardy to Watson, no run blocked once again;
15.1;?;Yardy to Watson, no run brought forward, half an appeal;
14.6;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run open-faced steer, down to third man;

12.3;1;PD Collingwood to Watson, 1 run pushed down the ground with a straight bat towards long on;

11.6;4;Tremlett to Clarke, FOUR runs Tremlett strays on to the pads and Clarke moves across and glances the ball off his hips towards the fine-leg boundary. Nothing fancy, text-book leg glance.;

11.3;1;Tremlett to Watson, 1 run full toss and Watson punches it down the ground for one;

10.6;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run both those fielders are back on the boundary now so Watson drives straight but along the ground;

6.5;W;Anderson to Marsh, OUT caught and bowled! Anderson was testing Marsh with this angle into the left-hander from round the wicket. He was attacking the stumps constantly and not giving the batsman room. Marsh pushed a bit more at this one, the ball hit the bat a little low and went straight back to the bowler.

Watson and Haddin to open. James Anderson is back in England's team and is opening the attack. One slip in place.
