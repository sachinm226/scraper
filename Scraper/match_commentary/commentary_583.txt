Data
13:30pm Australia lost early wickets, Clarke and Hussey then buckled down on a sluggish track to add exactly 100 in 29 overs. That sounds extremely dull yes, but with an inexperienced order to follow the senior duo opted to bat it out and keep wickets in hand. Both scored sapping half-centuries before West Indies struck back. White finished unbeaten on 40, unable to really smack the ball given the tennis-ball bounce. A score of 220 seemed the target, but they will have to settle for 213. I reckon we have a good contest on hand. Brydon and myself will be back for West Indies' chase, in about half an hour.
49.6;?;Taylor to Hopes, no run bouncer to end the over, Hopes backs away and flays at it, trying to uppercut it over gully but the ball beats him so Australia are kept to 213 for 5;
49.5;1;Taylor to White, 1 run another drop! White backs away and slices a slower ball to Gayle at extra cover, who leaps up full stretch and gets fingers to it, failing to latch on;
49.4;1;Taylor to Hopes, 1 run slips out a loopy full toss which Hopes can't put away, flicked to the deep;
49.3;1;Taylor to White, 1 run full and right up there, White heaves it along the ground to midwicket;
49.2;1;Taylor to Hopes, 1 run swings hard again, doesn't get it out of the screws, but one to midwicket;
49.2;1w;Taylor to Hopes, 1 wide drops in a bouncer with no pace on it at all, Hopes swats and misses and the umpire calls it wide as it misses his bat ... Taylor doesn't like the call, marginally above the head, but not enough to be called wide;
49.1;1;Taylor to White, 1 run in the blockhole, nearly, and White swings it down to long-on;
48.6;2;Bravo to Hopes, 2 runs well done, nearly a yorker on leg stump, clipped in the air over midwicket;
48.5;2;Bravo to Hopes, 2 runs doesn't get it right this time and Hopes flicks two to deep fine leg;
48.4;?;Bravo to Hopes, no run oh well done Bravo, following Hopes and honing a yorker into the pads, causing him to fall over onto his knees as the ball takes him out, excellent bowling;
48.3;1b;Bravo to White, 1 bye slower ball, White swings with his eyes shut, fails to connect, and another silly fumble by Browne gives up a run ... he's had a poor day behind the stumps;
48.2;2;Bravo to White, 2 runs full and down leg stump as he sees White moving about, well bowled, so thats a clipped couple more to the score out to deep fine leg;
48.1;1;Bravo to Hopes, 1 run makes room and skips down, Bravo knew he was coming and bowled it short and wide and Hopes swats it off the toe end of the bat down to mid-off;
37.6;W;Benn to Clarke, OUT and Benn breaks through! He's coming around the wicket, sends in a quicker ball that pitches on off, Clarke is walking across and trying to clip through leg, he's struck in line and that was not spinning, probably taking leg stump;Michael Clarke lbw b Benn 56 (142m 98b 6x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;
37.5;1;Benn to Hussey, 1 run flatter this time from Benn, Hussey tucks a single square;
37.4;6;Benn to Hussey, SIX runs tossed up outside off, Hussey picks this one up early and sweeps with the turn, it flies over deep midwicket and bounces just over the rope, Pollard dives in the deep but he was never really near that one. First six of the innings;
37.3;?;Benn to Hussey, no run Hussey sweeps, can't beat the man behind square;
37.2;1;Benn to Clarke, 1 run cut away for a single;
37.1;?;Benn to Clarke, no run dropped! Clarke drives it back to Benn's left, he hurls the hand out in hope and it bounces out, really tough chance, those either stick or they don't.;
36.6;?;Powell to Hussey, no run short ball, not a bad one from Powell, Hussey shapes to hook and then lets it go;
36.5;1;Powell to Clarke, 1 run angled in to the pads, Clarke clips it forward of square and despite another fumble in the deep from Bravo this time, they only get a single;

47.6;1;Taylor to Hopes, 1 run short on the stumps and he pulls over the man at midwicket, the slowness of the track not allowing the ball to come on, and the sweeper runs in to field;

47.4;1;Taylor to Hopes, 1 run short again and this one's worked along the ground to Fletcher;
47.3;1;Taylor to White, 1 run good grief, Fletcher's dropped him at deep square leg! White went hooking a short ball, undone by the sluggish bounce, but Taylor is let down by his fielder, keeping his eyes on it but not settling himself and spilling a simple catch, in and out;
47.2;4;Taylor to White, FOUR runs powerful shot, White makes room and muscles this very straight and a sliding long-on cannot get there, that shot came up because of the length Taylor bowled;
47.1;2;Taylor to White, 2 runs gives him more room, White cuts up and over point, not timed well and Pollard does well to run across in front of square and keep them to two;
47.1;3nb;Taylor to White, (no ball) 2 runs poor stuff, a front-foot no-ball, and he gives White room to cut past point;
46.6;1;Bravo to White, 1 run nearly a yorker but not quite, yet its only a driven single to mid-on;

34.6;1w;Gayle to Hussey, 1 wide down leg side, Hussey can't get bat on ball and Asad Rauf, after a long while to make his decision, calls it wide;
34.5;2;Gayle to Hussey, 2 runs guided away forward of point, they push through for two and West Indies are not switched on in the field here, that should have been kept to one;

32.6;4;Gayle to Clarke, FOUR runs very good shot from Clarke, Gayle pushing them through a tad quickly and Clarke waits, then with very soft hands cuts it so fine that it would have gone between the keeper and first slip, not that there was a slip, and it runs away for four. Excellent thinking from Clarke;

9:45am So 15 minutes after play was scheduled to start, we can now start ... or can we? The players were lying on the grass, standing around near the square, and rocking on hammock-like nets but now the sight screen problem seems to have been sorted out and its time for the players to switch on. And there's a bit of rain in the air. In fact, its spitting down.
No, umpires say we can play. Jerome Taylor runs in to Shaun Marsh, around the stumps.
9:30am Australia have won the toss and they will bat.
Team changes: West Indies have brought in Daren Powell and Patrick Browne, for Fidel Edwards and Denesh Ramdin, and an injured Ramnaresh Sarwan misses out. Shivnarine Chanderpaul is indeed in.
Issues with the sight screen, not for the first time during Australia's tour of the Caribbean. Play has been held up. Players stand around waiting. Arms wave elsewhere and members of the ground staff try to solve the matter. Embarrassing scenes from a West Indian perspective. All these problems at the start of a match. Why wasn't this settled before?
There are half a dozen men shifting the sight screen and using planks to add on to the sides. Not a good advertisement for cricket in the West Indies. The umpires do not look pleased. The players look frustrated.
9:20am - breaking news Brad Haddin will will return to Australia after not recovering sufficiently from a broken ring finger, which means Luke Ronchi, who made his international debut in the Twenty20 game last week in Barbados, gets his first ODI today.
9:00am Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's live ball-by-ball coverage of game two between West Indies and Australia. Today's match comes to us from scenic St George's, Grenada.
We'll be Jamie Alter, starting off commentary, and Brydon Coverdale, for stellar stints in between bulletining, here all day to take you though the match.
Big game this for Ricky Ponting, though he won't really admit it, for this will see him join former skipper Steve Waugh as Australia's only members of the prestigious 300-ODI club.
From a series perspective, West Indies will hope to bounce back after defeat in game one. Shivnarine Chanderpaul is reportedly fit to play, but some doubts linger over captain Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan.
Australia, ahead 1-0 and back on top of the ICC ODI world rankings after an 84-run victory on Tuesday, aren't expected to make any changes as Andrew Symonds' availability is still uncertain.
 Innings Start
18:00pm Australia win by 63 runs (D/L method) and go 2-0 up in the five-game series. West Indies were never in the chase after Lee struck first ball and Gayle went soon after, triggering a spate of silly shots. Chasing 213 wasn't easy on this tough track but West Indies really blew it. Chanderpaul notches up another unbeaten score, this time 45 off 77 balls. Injuries didn't help West Indies.
Clarke is the Man of the Match for his half-century and three wickets.
Thats it from Brydon, scorer Raju and myself tonight. Do come back and see us for game three on June 29 at 09:30 local, 13:30 GMT. This is Jamie Alter signing off. Cheers!
