Toss West Indies have asked Australia to bat. Ponting is out due to the wrist injury and Michael Clarke will lead Australia.
Greg Blewett, the former Australian batsman, did the pitch report and reckoned that while the wicket is pretty hard there is not much in for the bowlers. Win toss, bat first was his suggestion. Gayle obviously didn't agree.
Australia 1 Shaun Marsh, 2 Shane Watson, 3 Michael Clarke (capt), 4 Michael Hussey, 5 Andrew Symonds, 6 David Hussey, 7 Luke Ronchi (wk), 8 James Hopes, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Nathan Bracken.
West Indies 1 Chris Gayle (capt), 2 Xavier Marshall, 3 Ramnaresh Sarwan, 4 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 5 Dwayne Bravo, 6 Shawn Findlay, 7 Denesh Ramdin (wk), 8 Darren Sammy, 9 Nikita Miller, 10 Daren Powell, 11 Fidel Edwards.
Nikita Miller, the left-arm spinner, and Shawn Findlay, the batsman, will make their debuts.
"If the 2-0 Test result did not fully reflect the closeness of the [Test] series, the 3-0 scoreline in the ODIs has been totally justified," writes Brydon Coverdale in his preview. Can't argue with that.
 Innings Start
Stay on for the quotes from the post-match ceremony.
Gayle: We thought we could have got it. I should have carried on and saw the team home. The support was very good. I apologise for the loss.
Clarke: Ricky can get it [captaincy] back! The guys did a fantastic job. Gayle played really well but full credit to the guys who hung in there. Every body who gets a chance to play to Australia love it and cherish it.
Man of the Match: Andrew Symonds : "It was a nice wicket to bat on. I thought we had 30 runs short but in the end we had one too many for them! The ball got scuffed up and the batting became a touch difficult in the end for us.
That's it from us. Good bye and Good luck.
49.6;1;Watson to Sammy, 1 run Australia have won! just a single to covers. Low dipping full toss on the middle, hit straight to Clarke. Gayle is dejected and stares in to the distance. The Aussies are in a huddle. They break away and walk towards the pavilion. Gayle now stirs and walks down the staircase to shake hands with them, Fidel is downcast.

47.2;W;Lee to Findlay, OUT What a stunner from Michael Hussey at midwicket. The game swings around once more.
