Well done, South Africa. Marsh and Ponting were going for broke and Australia seemed on par for 305 or so but those two batsmen were sent back in relative succession and therein started an unusual slide from Australia. South Africa suddenly started catching stuff and the bowlers tidied up, and Australia had no options of scoring. The batting Powerplay, taken late in the innings, was an utter disaster for Australia. They lost big wickets inside it and no batsman was able to accelerate at the death. Just one boundary in the last 10 overs and three in the last 20. It is still a good total, but not a great one.
South Africa need 250 to win. We will be back in about 35 minutes or so. You could spend the break checking out Cricinfo's

4.1;W;Steyn to Warner, OUT lovely delivery, pitching short of a length in line with the stumps and nipping off the upright seam, cramping and squaring up Warner, with no foot movement, and the half-hearted shot towards the on side draws a faint edge through to Boucher, and thus Warner fails on his ODI debut;David Warner c ?Boucher b Steyn 5 (17m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 71.42;

Good morning - to those of you in hemispheres where it is - ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Cricinfo's live ball-by-ball coverage of the Australia versus South Africa ODI series. This is game two at Hobart, and we're not too far away from the toss. Tasmania's only taste of international cricket for the summer, this.
This game was virtually a sell-out before the explosive David Warner's inclusion but now tickets will be at a premium. Warner was orginially to play for New South Wales against Victoria in yesterday's Big Bash affair in Sydney last night, but instead rushed to Hobart after Michael Clarke was ruled out of this series.
South Africa, of course, lead the series 1-0 after that tense win at the MCG, the sixth time they've beaten Australia at that venue. Australia seemed to have gathered some momentum after their final-Test win, clinching the Twenty20s 2-0, but they slipped up towards the end of the MCG clash.
This one-day series promises to be as competitive as ever. The weather looks nice and sunny, there is a large crowd filing into the ground, so pretty much perfect conditions for a Sunday's day of cricket. The pitch is traditionally batsman-friendly but in first-class matches this season, I've heard, it has offered considerable help to the bowlers. We will know soon how that pans out at Bellerive Oval today.
Let us go down to the toss. Johan Botha has won it and has decided that South Africa will field. Two changes for them - Makhaya Ntini and a fit-again AB de Villiers come in for Morne Morkel and Vaughan Van Jaarsveld.
There are two ODI debutants for Australia - Warner and Ryan Harris, who replaces Shaun Tait.
There are a few minutes to kill before the start. We've got some wallpapers of Australian and South African players for you to download. Twitter users can follow our news here.
I'm Jamie Alter, by the way, joined by Sanjay Murari. Thanks for tuning in again.
Right, shall we? The players are ready, so whats stopping us? Beautiful day in Hobart. Dale Steyn has the ball, and he will bowl to Shaun Marsh. Game on!
 Innings Start
What fun. Australia look relieved. South Africa look miffed. Hilfenhaus bowled a tidy last over, despite the six, but he can credit plenty to that man Bracken. The players all shake hands. This was a tense match. Hats off to Australia. South Africa, like the home side earlier in the day, simply lost steam. Australia, led by Bracken, curbed the runs and took wickets.
At one stage it appeared that Australia would have only themselves to blame. They were 1 for 131 half way through their innings, and 300 was on the cards. Even after half-centurions Marsh and Ponting departed in relative succession, surely Australia should have got 280 from there. But South Africa took five wickets for 53 runs in the last 10 overs, and 7 for 92 in the last 20. It was a tremendous comeback to restrict Australia to 249, but there was never a sense of urgency in their chase and they ended up losers. Kallis and de Villiers were batting decently but like Marsh and Ponting, they were separated and the chase lost steam. Credit to Bracken and Hilfenhaus and Harris.
Well folks, its been a terrific match. We will just get you the Man of the Match.
It is Shaun Marsh, who backed up his 79 in Melbourne with 78 as Australia secured an important victory.
So thats all we have today, hope you've had fun. Come back and see us for the third match from Sydney on January 23 at 14:15 local local. Until next time, goodbye!

South Africa's chase will begin. They are opening with Gibbs and Amla. Lovely clear skies overhead. The required run rate is a round five an over. The Australians had a huddle. They do not have a specialist spinner on a ground where Tasmania have used three spinners at times this season. Hilfenhaus has the ball.
