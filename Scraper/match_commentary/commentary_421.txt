Mark: "Siddle's looked better this morn, but not quick, and Hilf is bowling military medium. Pattinson's touched 140, but they've all lost a yard since the India series last summer. Guarantee Steyn and Morkel will be much sharper than this, even Kallis will."
 Innings Start
10.50 am Australia have declared at drinks on the fifth morning. They lead by 115.
Paul: "Clarke! Declare now. Then try to get 2-3 wickets before lunch. No glory in scoring another 300." He just did. The umpire called for drinks to come on the field and Clarke decided he'd rather have them in the dressing room and stick the South Africans in. There are 79 overs left in the day.
How is the pitch playing? Very well for a fifth day wicket. Some balls have deviated off the pitch today, and the bounce is still there. Batting has been hardest, relatively speaking, against the new ball.
Smudgeon: "One thing Pup is NOT going to do is play for a personal record. I've been particularly impressed with the way he's played. Last summer, he had the perfect opportunity to play for a record innings, and instead declared with victory foremost on his mind. Our boy's all growed up (sniff)..."

Must have been something else? The third umpire is taking a while with this, and Bowden eventually says not out. South Africa lose a review, they have one left.;

 Innings Start
4.55 pm The Test has come to an end. Clarke has agreed to call it off with 11 overs remaining. It's been drawn and you'd have to say Australia had the better of it ever since the second day was washed out completely. South Africa won't be too disappointed either, especially after they lost Duminy to injury on the first day before he could play any sort of role in this game. The pitch seemed to be on the flatter side, but had one day not been lost to rain, there could have been a result.
The Man of the Match is the double-centurion Michael Clarke, who said Australia will take plenty of momentum from this performance to the Adelaide Test, which is a whole week away.
There will be lots of analysis from Firdose Moonda and Brydon Coverdale up on the site over the new couple of hours. Thank you for all your emails over the last five days. I try and read as many as I can! Cheers.
