9.25am: We're about five minutes away from the start. Brydon, our man at the ground says it's "very hot, hotter than the first match, therefore very draining for the players."
Bracken has the ball.
Toss: News from the center is that Bangladesh have won the toss and will bat first.
Team news (8.55 am): Shane Watson plays his first game and he replaces Brett Geeves, who had a decent debut. For Bangladesh, the injury to Raqibul Hasan has given an opportunity to Junaid Siddique, the opener.
So Watson will open the batting with Shaun Marsh, meaning that James Hopes will drop down the order. Junaid's was an expected selection after Raqibul was ruled out with a fractured finger.
Australia (from) 1 Shane Watson, 2 Shaun Marsh, 3 Michael Clarke (capt), 4 Michael Hussey, 5 David Hussey, 6 Brad Haddin (wk), 7 Cameron White, 8 James Hopes, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Nathan Bracken, 11 Stuart Clark.
Bangladesh (from) 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Junaid Siddique, 3 Mohammad Ashraful (capt), 4 Mehrab Hossain jnr, 5 Shakib al Hasan, 6 Alok Kapali, 7 Dhiman Ghosh (wk), 8 Mashrafe Mortaza, 9 Abdur Razzak, 10 Nazmul Hossain, 11 Shahadat Hossain.
Whether or not Bangladesh are still intimidated by Mitchell Johnson's pace, they have to figure out a way to stick around for 50 overs. It has seemed like an ordeal each time time they've faced quality opposition and one wonders when the misery will end. A pity though that Raqibul's ruled out, as he's one of the more patient batsmen in the line-up.
Speaking of batsmen, Stuart Capel chips in with this stat: "Should any Bangladesh batsman reach fifty today he would become the first to register a half century at the Marrara Cricket Ground. Currently, Alok Kapali's 49 back in 2003 remains the highest."
