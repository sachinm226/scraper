Shakeeb: "Here is trick and serious question folks. Ball hit the stumps and bails remained intact ultimately Wade benefited. However, had that ball hit the pads and there was DRS - he would have been given out coz ball was "hitting" the stump, what guarantee DRS provides that bails had fallen? Maybe player should be out when ball hits the stump." -- Haha, I'm wondering what happens if a batsman is plumb lbw and the umpire says "not out, the bails wouldn't have fallen."
5.10pm Matthew Wade has led Australia's recovery from 5 for 78 to 9 for 268. A stupendous fightback from Australia. Glenn Maxwell and the lower order did their part. Pakistan's bowlers were terrific right from the outset, but lost their composure and their heads during the final onslaught. 269 is going to be a hard chase for an inexperienced line-up. But they sure can. We'll be back soon.

46.3;1;Amir to Stanlake, 1 run full and straight, hit down towards mid-on. The fielder dives to his right to save three. Good effort. Stanlake's first international runs;

37.3;1;Nawaz to Wade, 1 run advances to the pitch and works to long-on with the spin. Good batting from Wade, knows there isn't big spin;
37.2;1;Nawaz to Cummins, 1 run a tad too full on off, driven with the spin to long-off;
37.1;1;Nawaz to Wade, 1 run Wade shimmies down to the pitch to flick to deep midwicket;

34.1;?;Hafeez to Wade, no run slow through the air, outside off, driven to cover;
33.6;W;Nawaz to Faulkner, OUT 90 kph, edged and gone. Faulkner falls. Pakistan strike again. Good captaincy to have the slip in place and Faulkner edges behind. A lovely length, shortish but close to off, Extracts a bit if turn, Faulkner plays away from his body and gets a thick outside edge which is well held by Hafeez at first slip, to his left. That came quickly.;James Faulkner c Mohammad Hafeez b Mohammad Nawaz 5 (13m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 41.66;
33.5;?;Nawaz to Faulkner, no run nice. Flat on off, blocked into the off side;

31.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Faulkner, no run full and wide outside off, Faulkner gets forward and leaves;

31.1;?;Wahab Riaz to Wade, no run a fullish length outside off, dabbed towards backward point;
30.6;W;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, OUT gone! Hasan Ali has varied his pace beautifully in this over, and he does Maxwell with another little offcutter. Looks to flick it over midwicket, is through his shot too early, and it loops up off the high part of his bat and midwicket takes the simplest of catches;Glenn Maxwell c Mohammad Hafeez b Hasan Ali 60 (77m 56b 7x4 0x6) SR: 107.14;
30.5;2;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 2 runs short ball on off stump, this one is dug in with more venom, bounces steeply, and Maxwell has to pull it from over his right shoulder. Ends up top-edging very fine, to the left of third man;
30.4;?;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, no run length ball on off stump, punched to short extra;
30.3;?;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, no run back-of-a-length slower ball, looks like the offcutter, comes in a little bit and cramps Maxwell as he skips away from the line to hit through the off side. Ends up having to play that to midwicket instead;
30.2;4;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, FOUR runs short outside off, this time it rises to the perfect height to pull, just around chest height, and he puts it away between midwicket and mid-on;
30.2;1w;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 wide bouncer outside off, maybe the slower bouncer. Maxwell wanted to pull, but it rises too high for that and he aborts his shot;
30.1;?;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, no run good ball, length ball angling into middle and off. Maxwell wanted some room to flay that through the covers. Had to check his shot in the end while playing it to short extra;
29.6;?;Wahab Riaz to Wade, no run short slower ball outside off, Wade lets it come on and squeezes it to backward point, rolling his wrists over at the top of the bounce;
29.5;?;Wahab Riaz to Wade, no run beaten. Goes on the back foot to slash that through point, but it probably wasn't short enough, and he ended up going with a diagonal bat;
29.4;1;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run short on leg stump, pulled to the right of deep square leg;
29.4;1w;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 wide short down leg, Maxwell misses his pull and it's given wide. Pakistan appeal for a caught behind. Replays confirm there was no bat anywhere near the ball;
29.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, no run short on off stump, rises on his toes to defend into the off side;
29.2;1;Wahab Riaz to Wade, 1 run back of a length outside off, dabbed down to the right of backward point. I think they picked the right fielder to chance another quick single against. It was Imad Wasim, and he's left-handed, and he fumbled as he tried to pick up and transfer hands;
29.1;1;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run I don't know if he meant that. Short ball, angling away from off stump. Maxwell was leaving that, I think, and the ball ended up hitting the middle of his bat as he pulls it back behind him and running down to third man;
28.6;?;Hasan Ali to Wade, no run shortish on middle stump, maybe not short enough to pull. Wade is a little late on the shot and the ball hits his stomach;
28.5;1;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run length ball close to off stump, looks to drive through mid-off, maybe, doesn't time it and it ends up going slowly to the left of short cover. Another easily taken quick single;
28.4;1;Hasan Ali to Wade, 1 run back of a length on middle stump, worked to the left of midwicket;
28.3;1;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length outside off, punched to deep point;
28.2;1;Hasan Ali to Wade, 1 run short outside off, looks for the horizontal-bat slap, the ball hits the outside half of the bat and runs down to third man;
28.1;1;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run short on off stump, pulls to deep square leg and brings up a superb half-century, full of craft and innovation;
27.6;2;Nawaz to Wade, 2 runs once again, Wade works a ball off the stumps into the leg side;
27.5;1;Nawaz to Maxwell, 1 run down the track now, clips into the midwicket region;
27.4;1;Nawaz to Wade, 1 run flat on middle stump, clipped through midwicket;
27.3;1;Nawaz to Maxwell, 1 run oh my, nearly gets himself out in bizarre fashion. Goes for that chip-drive to the flighted ball outside off. Great spot from Ian Chappell on TV commentary. Saw that Maxwell's bat had hit his front pad before meeting bat, changing its course slightly. May have wanted to drive that ball over the covers, instead ends up hitting towards long-off sprinting in from the rope. Dives forward desperately but can't reach the ball in time to catch it;
27.2;?;Nawaz to Maxwell, no run length ball on middle and off, Maxwell gets on the front foot to defend back down the pitch;
27.1;4;Nawaz to Maxwell, FOUR runs flat, angling into leg stump, Maxwell goes for the reverse-sweep again. He's working against the angle, but he's not bothered, those wrists do all the work to hit it in the air to the backward point boundary;
26.6;?;Hasan Ali to Wade, no run length ball outside off, driven to short cover;
26.5;?;Hasan Ali to Wade, no run fullish on off stump, driven back to the bowler;
26.4;2;Hasan Ali to Wade, 2 runs back of a length on leg stump, worked through backward square leg. They chance a second, throw is at the bowler's end, and make it fairly easily. Would have been interesting had Wahab's throw been closer to the bowler;
26.3;1;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run short ball over off stump, pulled to deep square leg;
26.2;1;Hasan Ali to Wade, 1 run back of a length on middle stump, tucked down to long leg;
26.1;1;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length on middle and off, whipped through square leg;
25.6;?;Nawaz to Wade, no run there's that Wade trademark again. Stretches out to a length ball pitching outside off and rolls his wrists over to play it to short fine leg. Wanted a single, and Maxwell, rightly, sent him back;
25.5;1;Nawaz to Maxwell, 1 run down the track now, and that's lovely. A checked chip, on the bounce, to long-on, played with the full face of the bat showing;
25.4;4;Nawaz to Maxwell, FOUR runs shot. This is glorious from Maxwell. Third man and backward point were both in the circle, Nawaz gave him the perfect line, floated up outside off, and those quick hands are through the ball in a blur to reverse-sweep between the two fielders;
25.3;?;Nawaz to Maxwell, no run length ball outside off, presses forward to defend into the covers;
25.2;1;Nawaz to Wade, 1 run down the track now, clips with the turn to long-on;
25.1;?;Nawaz to Wade, no run again looks to work a ball from outside off to fine leg. Turns more than he expects as he comes on the front foot and it goes past his inside edge and hits front pad. Not too much of an appeal, that was probably headed down leg;
24.6;4;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, FOUR runs a bit of flight on off stump, and Maxwell absolutely smashes that. A slap-sweep with a roll of the wrists to drill that to the midwicket boundary;
24.5;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run down the track now, Imad shortens his length outside off. Maxwell pushes with a straight bat to mid-on;
24.4;2;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 2 runs length ball angling into the stumps, gets on the front foot and works it to the left of deep square leg;
24.3;4;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, FOUR runs shot! Fired in on a good length, and Maxwell uses the angle adroitly, gets forward and uses his bottom wrist brilliantly to shovel-sweep from outside off, into the long leg region;
24.2;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run flat, back of a length, angling into off stump. Goes back and across to work into the leg side. Hasan Ali takes his eye off the ball while sliding to his left from midwicket to field it;
24.1;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run quickish length ball outside off, stretches out and defends into the covers;
23.6;?;Nawaz to Maxwell, no run quickish, back of a length, angling into off stump. Maxwell goes on the back foot and whips it wristily back to the bowler;
23.5;1;Nawaz to Wade, 1 run chips down the track now, gets close to the pitch and flicks to deep midwicket;
23.4;?;Nawaz to Wade, no run good ball, a bit of loop and dip outside off. Wade stretches out to defend, gets an inside-edge that rolls to short fine leg;
23.3;1;Nawaz to Maxwell, 1 run down the track now, and that's a nice bit of old-fashioned ODI batting. Nawaz fired it into his pads, and he whipped it in the air, but checked his shot, to hit it on the bounce to long-on;
23.2;?;Nawaz to Maxwell, no run length ball outside off, Maxwell opens his bat face to drive to point;
23.1;4;Nawaz to Maxwell, FOUR runs tossed up outside off, and that's lovely from Maxwell, full extension of the arms to lift that gently over the covers, finds the gap to the right of the sweeper. He's batting with a cap on now, made that shot look even better;
22.6;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run fired in flat, back of a length, angling into off stump. Blocked back to the bowler;
22.5;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run length ball on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg;
22.4;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run down the track and that's smartly bowled. Slows it down a bit, pulls the length back, and Maxwell has to defend into the covers, with the turn;
22.3;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run fuller, on off stump now, Wade clips through backward square leg;
22.2;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run back of a length, angling across the left-hander, who shuffles across and flicks from outside off to midwicket;
22.1;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run fullish on off stump, clipped against the angle to midwicket;
21.6;2;Amir to Maxwell, 2 runs loses his line with the change of strike. This would have been a perfect off-stump ball to Wade. Maxwell clips it off his pad to the left of deep square leg;
21.5;1;Amir to Wade, 1 run fullish on off stump, whipped to deep backward square leg;
21.4;?;Amir to Wade, no run length ball angling into off stump, Wade steps across and clips to midwicket;
21.3;4;Amir to Wade, FOUR runs full, fairly wide outside off. Wade goes after it without moving his feet too much, edges it thickly, but it's well wide of slip and races away to the third man boundary;
21.2;?;Amir to Wade, no run shortish outside off, Wade goes deep in his crease and stabs to backward point;
21.1;?;Amir to Wade, no run back of a length, a bit of inward movement, and Wade is given out lbw! He's reviewed this immediately, convinced he's inside-edged it. He has. Poor shot from Wade, feet rooted to the crease and he looks to drive on the up, down the ground. Ball nips in off the seam and hits back pad, off the inside edge;
20.6;2;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 2 runs down the track again, and again Imad bowls flatter but along a straighter line. Maxwell clips neatly through midwicket;
20.5;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run down the track skips Maxwell, Imad fires it quicker, punched back to the bowler;
20.4;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run back of a length on off stump, goes back and across to work it through square leg;
20.3;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run a bit quicker, punched off the front foot to short extra;
20.2;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run full again, drifting across the left-hander, who stretches out to block into the covers;
20.1;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run flighted outside off, Maxwell reaches out and drives with an open face, in the air for a while but into the gap to the left of short extra-cover;
19.6;1;Amir to Maxwell, 1 run fullish outside off, driven to deep point;
19.5;1;Amir to Wade, 1 run straighter now, on leg stump, flicked to long leg;
19.4;2;Amir to Wade, 2 runs very full, again a hint of possible reverse into the left-hander, towards off stump. Wade clips it away through midwicket;
19.3;1;Amir to Maxwell, 1 run short on middle and off, gets across and whips it away through backward square leg;
19.2;1;Amir to Wade, 1 run back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Shuffles across to work it wide of mid-on;
19.1;?;Amir to Wade, no run back of a length close to off stump, gets back and across to defend back to the bowler;
18.6;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run floated up slow on middle and off, stretches out and rolls his wrists over to play that watchfully to mid-on. Another excellent over from Imad;
18.5;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run back of a length on middle stump, defended back to the bowler;
18.4;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run back of a length, a little closer to off stump, shuffles across and tucks it into the leg side for a risky single. Direct hit would have had Maxwell at the striker's end, but Akmal, moving to his left from midwicket, can't hit the stumps;
18.3;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run back of a length outside off, punched to short extra-cover;
18.2;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run fullish, angling away from off stump, gets nicely forward to block it back to the bowler;
18.1;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run length ball swerving in towards off stump, check-driven to long-off;
17.6;1;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover;
17.5;?;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, no run shortish on off stump, defended towards point;
17.4;1;Wahab Riaz to Wade, 1 run length ball, and was that a tiny bit of inward swerve towards middle stump, maybe some seriously early reverse? No worries for Wade just yet, lets it come on and clips quietly through midwicket;
17.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Wade, no run back of a length close to off stump, defended with an open face towards point;
17.3;1w;Wahab Riaz to Wade, 1 wide bouncer, off-target, ends up angling it a fair way down the leg side;
17.2;1;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run length ball angling away from off stump, Maxwell gets across to push into the covers;
17.1;1;Wahab Riaz to Wade, 1 run shortish outside off, Wade lets it come on and dabs down to third man;
16.6;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run fired in flat on the stumps, Maxwell shows the full face to defend to midwicket;
16.5;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run sweeps again, against the angle. It's a bit of a risk given the drift Imad gets away from the left-hander, but Wade manages to play it safely enough into the fine leg region;
16.4;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run fullish on leg stump, clipped through square leg;
16.3;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run slated across, and Wade gets across, gets down low, and lap-sweeps from just outside off, into the short fine-leg region;
16.2;W;Imad Wasim to Marsh, OUT this time there is some turn, and Marsh nicks off! That excellent length again, never quite up there to drive, on off stump. Marsh chances the drive, and only manages a thin edge through to Rizwan;Mitchell Marsh c ?Mohammad Rizwan b Imad Wasim 4 (30m 17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.52;
16.1;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run length ball angling into middle and off, no turn. Maxwell shows the full face to push to long-on;
15.6;?;Wahab Riaz to Marsh, no run fullish outside off, defended into the off side, and drinks;
15.5;?;Wahab Riaz to Marsh, no run well left. On a length outside off, left alone. Rizwan fails to collect cleanly, almost hits the helmet positioned behind him;
15.4;1;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run too straight this time, nudged down to fine leg;
15.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, no run much better. Good length on a fifth-stump line. The ball deviates past the bat;
15.2;4;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, FOUR runs 144 kph, another terrible delivery from Wahab. Short and wide, scythed behind point for four. This isn't good bowling;
15.1;?;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, no run offcutter on off, played into the leg side;
14.6;?;Imad Wasim to Marsh, no run flat on off and middle, played back;
14.5;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run short on middle, punched to long-on;

14.1;?;Imad Wasim to Marsh, no run 91 kph, pushed away towards midwicket. Another dot;
13.6;?;Hafeez to Maxwell, no run nice bowling, Slow through the air, some flight outside off, defended. "Jaldi karo," (hurry up) screams Riwan. Not a bad tactic that, get through overs without these two noticing;

13.2;?;Hafeez to Maxwell, no run worked towards midwicket;
13.1;1;Hafeez to Marsh, 1 run flat on middle, pushed out to long-on. An easy single, why give him one there?;
12.6;W;Imad Wasim to Head, OUT edged and gone. Wasim strikes. Pakistan chipping away. Head looked all at sea against the non-turning spin of Wasim. A flat delivery outside off, skids on with the arm again. Head looks to slap a drive through cover but plays inside the line, like he has been doing against Wasim. The ball kisses the outside edge and settles in Rizwan's gloves. Good catch too;Travis Head c ?Mohammad Rizwan b Imad Wasim 39 (61m 39b 5x4 0x6) SR: 100;

9.5;?;Hasan Ali to Head, no run much much better. Full and straight, 139 kph, Head defends;

9.3;4;Hasan Ali to Head, FOUR runs full and wide from Hasan. Tripe. Drilled through cover. All timing, lots of power too.;
9.2;W;Hasan Ali to Lynn, OUT that isn't a great shot and Lynn falls. Another BBL stroke. Slower delivery this time, full and wide. Lynn just chooses the wrong shot. Premeditated. Could have clattered that over the off side, but he got down on one knee and slog-swept a drag-flick straight into the air. Rizwan runs around, doesn't look to comfortable underneath the skier but importantly, takes the catch. Had to drag that from too wide.;Chris Lynn c ?Mohammad Rizwan b Hasan Ali 16 (24m 12b 0x4 1x6) SR: 133.33;

8.1;1;Wahab Riaz to Lynn, 1 run 143 kph, better, more like it. Back of a length on middle and leg, swatted to deep square leg for one. Hustled Lynn for pace;
8.1;1w;Wahab Riaz to Lynn, 1 wide digs one in on off, so high that it loops over Lynn. Don't have to be so short at the Gabba. A back of a length is ideal here;
7.6;?;Hasan Ali to Head, no run 135 kph, fullish delivery around off, driven to cover from the crease;
7.5;4;Hasan Ali to Head, 4 runs on the pads, poor bowling this. Flicked through midwicket. Such a long boundary that four runs are run with time to spare;

6.1;?;Amir to Head, no run full and straight from Amir, Head is hanging on the back foot but is able to defend;
5.6;?;Hasan Ali to Lynn, no run big appeal! No says the umpire. Good length delivery around off, the ball nips back in and cuts Lynn in half. A noise, probably off the thigh pad, on its way to the keeper.;

4.5;?;Amir to Lynn, no run nicely bowled from Amir. Full and straight, some inswing. Lynn flicks to square leg;
4.4;W;Amir to Smith, OUT edged and gone! Another peach from Amir. Fantastic captaincy from Azhar, after all the flak he's received. Bowls it full and wide. Asks Smith to drive through the vacant cover region. Smith can't say no with his form, can he? His feet are rooted in the crease, his drive is away from his body. The ball holds its line outside off and takes the edge. A routine catch for Rizwan.;Steven Smith c ?Mohammad Rizwan b Mohammad Amir 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
4.3;W;Amir to Warner, OUT what a delivery! He has been doing it all afternoon. Superb bowling. Amir pushes this one fuller and straighter. Warner sees something on middle and chooses to flick into the leg side but is undone by substantial away swing. The ball beats the flick by some distance and clips the top of the bails. Wow, he wasn't close to that. Not a great shot.;David Warner b Mohammad Amir 7 (19m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.88;

2.5;?;Amir to Warner, no run jaffa. Takes something similar to beat Warner. Good length on off, the ball swerves away and beats the outside edge. Warner's feet were rooted in the crease;
2.4;1;Amir to Head, 1 run dabbed down to third man with an angled bat. Not much movement of the feet;
2.3;1;Amir to Warner, 1 run there is Warner's first. Full delivery, straight, a thick inside edge down to fine leg. Nice length this from Amir, seeing if the ball will swing;

49.6;1;Hasan Ali to Wade, 1 run a leading edge to point and Wade gets hundred. Another slower ball on middle, Wade gets enough bat to get the run he required for his maiden ODI hundred. Screams in delight, the dressing room and the Gabba are all up. A fantastic knock this from Wade;
49.5;2;Hasan Ali to Wade, 2 runs he gets there. How did he make that? Short delivery on leg, pulled towards square leg. The keeper gets there but returns a bad throw off-balance. Hasan fumbles his collection. Onto 99;

46.3;1;Amir to Stanlake, 1 run full and straight, hit down towards mid-on. The fielder dives to his right to save three. Good effort. Stanlake's first international runs;

33.6;W;Nawaz to Faulkner, OUT 90 kph, edged and gone. Faulkner falls. Pakistan strike again. Good captaincy to have the slip in place and Faulkner edges behind. A lovely length, shortish but close to off, Extracts a bit if turn, Faulkner plays away from his body and gets a thick outside edge which is well held by Hafeez at first slip, to his left. That came quickly.;James Faulkner c Mohammad Hafeez b Mohammad Nawaz 5 (13m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 41.66;

31.1;?;Wahab Riaz to Wade, no run a fullish length outside off, dabbed towards backward point;
30.6;W;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, OUT gone! Hasan Ali has varied his pace beautifully in this over, and he does Maxwell with another little offcutter. Looks to flick it over midwicket, is through his shot too early, and it loops up off the high part of his bat and midwicket takes the simplest of catches;Glenn Maxwell c Mohammad Hafeez b Hasan Ali 60 (77m 56b 7x4 0x6) SR: 107.14;
30.5;2;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 2 runs short ball on off stump, this one is dug in with more venom, bounces steeply, and Maxwell has to pull it from over his right shoulder. Ends up top-edging very fine, to the left of third man;
30.4;?;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, no run length ball on off stump, punched to short extra;
30.3;?;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, no run back-of-a-length slower ball, looks like the offcutter, comes in a little bit and cramps Maxwell as he skips away from the line to hit through the off side. Ends up having to play that to midwicket instead;
30.2;4;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, FOUR runs short outside off, this time it rises to the perfect height to pull, just around chest height, and he puts it away between midwicket and mid-on;
30.2;1w;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 wide bouncer outside off, maybe the slower bouncer. Maxwell wanted to pull, but it rises too high for that and he aborts his shot;
30.1;?;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, no run good ball, length ball angling into middle and off. Maxwell wanted some room to flay that through the covers. Had to check his shot in the end while playing it to short extra;
29.6;?;Wahab Riaz to Wade, no run short slower ball outside off, Wade lets it come on and squeezes it to backward point, rolling his wrists over at the top of the bounce;
29.5;?;Wahab Riaz to Wade, no run beaten. Goes on the back foot to slash that through point, but it probably wasn't short enough, and he ended up going with a diagonal bat;
29.4;1;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run short on leg stump, pulled to the right of deep square leg;
29.4;1w;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 wide short down leg, Maxwell misses his pull and it's given wide. Pakistan appeal for a caught behind. Replays confirm there was no bat anywhere near the ball;
29.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, no run short on off stump, rises on his toes to defend into the off side;
29.2;1;Wahab Riaz to Wade, 1 run back of a length outside off, dabbed down to the right of backward point. I think they picked the right fielder to chance another quick single against. It was Imad Wasim, and he's left-handed, and he fumbled as he tried to pick up and transfer hands;
29.1;1;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run I don't know if he meant that. Short ball, angling away from off stump. Maxwell was leaving that, I think, and the ball ended up hitting the middle of his bat as he pulls it back behind him and running down to third man;
28.6;?;Hasan Ali to Wade, no run shortish on middle stump, maybe not short enough to pull. Wade is a little late on the shot and the ball hits his stomach;
28.5;1;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run length ball close to off stump, looks to drive through mid-off, maybe, doesn't time it and it ends up going slowly to the left of short cover. Another easily taken quick single;
28.4;1;Hasan Ali to Wade, 1 run back of a length on middle stump, worked to the left of midwicket;
28.3;1;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length outside off, punched to deep point;
28.2;1;Hasan Ali to Wade, 1 run short outside off, looks for the horizontal-bat slap, the ball hits the outside half of the bat and runs down to third man;
28.1;1;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run short on off stump, pulls to deep square leg and brings up a superb half-century, full of craft and innovation;
27.6;2;Nawaz to Wade, 2 runs once again, Wade works a ball off the stumps into the leg side;
27.5;1;Nawaz to Maxwell, 1 run down the track now, clips into the midwicket region;
27.4;1;Nawaz to Wade, 1 run flat on middle stump, clipped through midwicket;
27.3;1;Nawaz to Maxwell, 1 run oh my, nearly gets himself out in bizarre fashion. Goes for that chip-drive to the flighted ball outside off. Great spot from Ian Chappell on TV commentary. Saw that Maxwell's bat had hit his front pad before meeting bat, changing its course slightly. May have wanted to drive that ball over the covers, instead ends up hitting towards long-off sprinting in from the rope. Dives forward desperately but can't reach the ball in time to catch it;
27.2;?;Nawaz to Maxwell, no run length ball on middle and off, Maxwell gets on the front foot to defend back down the pitch;
27.1;4;Nawaz to Maxwell, FOUR runs flat, angling into leg stump, Maxwell goes for the reverse-sweep again. He's working against the angle, but he's not bothered, those wrists do all the work to hit it in the air to the backward point boundary;
26.6;?;Hasan Ali to Wade, no run length ball outside off, driven to short cover;
26.5;?;Hasan Ali to Wade, no run fullish on off stump, driven back to the bowler;
26.4;2;Hasan Ali to Wade, 2 runs back of a length on leg stump, worked through backward square leg. They chance a second, throw is at the bowler's end, and make it fairly easily. Would have been interesting had Wahab's throw been closer to the bowler;
26.3;1;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run short ball over off stump, pulled to deep square leg;
26.2;1;Hasan Ali to Wade, 1 run back of a length on middle stump, tucked down to long leg;
26.1;1;Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length on middle and off, whipped through square leg;
25.6;?;Nawaz to Wade, no run there's that Wade trademark again. Stretches out to a length ball pitching outside off and rolls his wrists over to play it to short fine leg. Wanted a single, and Maxwell, rightly, sent him back;
25.5;1;Nawaz to Maxwell, 1 run down the track now, and that's lovely. A checked chip, on the bounce, to long-on, played with the full face of the bat showing;
25.4;4;Nawaz to Maxwell, FOUR runs shot. This is glorious from Maxwell. Third man and backward point were both in the circle, Nawaz gave him the perfect line, floated up outside off, and those quick hands are through the ball in a blur to reverse-sweep between the two fielders;
25.3;?;Nawaz to Maxwell, no run length ball outside off, presses forward to defend into the covers;
25.2;1;Nawaz to Wade, 1 run down the track now, clips with the turn to long-on;
25.1;?;Nawaz to Wade, no run again looks to work a ball from outside off to fine leg. Turns more than he expects as he comes on the front foot and it goes past his inside edge and hits front pad. Not too much of an appeal, that was probably headed down leg;
24.6;4;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, FOUR runs a bit of flight on off stump, and Maxwell absolutely smashes that. A slap-sweep with a roll of the wrists to drill that to the midwicket boundary;
24.5;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run down the track now, Imad shortens his length outside off. Maxwell pushes with a straight bat to mid-on;
24.4;2;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 2 runs length ball angling into the stumps, gets on the front foot and works it to the left of deep square leg;
24.3;4;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, FOUR runs shot! Fired in on a good length, and Maxwell uses the angle adroitly, gets forward and uses his bottom wrist brilliantly to shovel-sweep from outside off, into the long leg region;
24.2;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run flat, back of a length, angling into off stump. Goes back and across to work into the leg side. Hasan Ali takes his eye off the ball while sliding to his left from midwicket to field it;
24.1;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run quickish length ball outside off, stretches out and defends into the covers;
23.6;?;Nawaz to Maxwell, no run quickish, back of a length, angling into off stump. Maxwell goes on the back foot and whips it wristily back to the bowler;
23.5;1;Nawaz to Wade, 1 run chips down the track now, gets close to the pitch and flicks to deep midwicket;
23.4;?;Nawaz to Wade, no run good ball, a bit of loop and dip outside off. Wade stretches out to defend, gets an inside-edge that rolls to short fine leg;
23.3;1;Nawaz to Maxwell, 1 run down the track now, and that's a nice bit of old-fashioned ODI batting. Nawaz fired it into his pads, and he whipped it in the air, but checked his shot, to hit it on the bounce to long-on;
23.2;?;Nawaz to Maxwell, no run length ball outside off, Maxwell opens his bat face to drive to point;
23.1;4;Nawaz to Maxwell, FOUR runs tossed up outside off, and that's lovely from Maxwell, full extension of the arms to lift that gently over the covers, finds the gap to the right of the sweeper. He's batting with a cap on now, made that shot look even better;
22.6;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run fired in flat, back of a length, angling into off stump. Blocked back to the bowler;
22.5;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run length ball on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg;
22.4;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run down the track and that's smartly bowled. Slows it down a bit, pulls the length back, and Maxwell has to defend into the covers, with the turn;
22.3;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run fuller, on off stump now, Wade clips through backward square leg;
22.2;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run back of a length, angling across the left-hander, who shuffles across and flicks from outside off to midwicket;
22.1;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run fullish on off stump, clipped against the angle to midwicket;
21.6;2;Amir to Maxwell, 2 runs loses his line with the change of strike. This would have been a perfect off-stump ball to Wade. Maxwell clips it off his pad to the left of deep square leg;
21.5;1;Amir to Wade, 1 run fullish on off stump, whipped to deep backward square leg;
21.4;?;Amir to Wade, no run length ball angling into off stump, Wade steps across and clips to midwicket;
21.3;4;Amir to Wade, FOUR runs full, fairly wide outside off. Wade goes after it without moving his feet too much, edges it thickly, but it's well wide of slip and races away to the third man boundary;
21.2;?;Amir to Wade, no run shortish outside off, Wade goes deep in his crease and stabs to backward point;
21.1;?;Amir to Wade, no run back of a length, a bit of inward movement, and Wade is given out lbw! He's reviewed this immediately, convinced he's inside-edged it. He has. Poor shot from Wade, feet rooted to the crease and he looks to drive on the up, down the ground. Ball nips in off the seam and hits back pad, off the inside edge;
20.6;2;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 2 runs down the track again, and again Imad bowls flatter but along a straighter line. Maxwell clips neatly through midwicket;
20.5;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run down the track skips Maxwell, Imad fires it quicker, punched back to the bowler;
20.4;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run back of a length on off stump, goes back and across to work it through square leg;
20.3;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run a bit quicker, punched off the front foot to short extra;
20.2;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run full again, drifting across the left-hander, who stretches out to block into the covers;
20.1;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run flighted outside off, Maxwell reaches out and drives with an open face, in the air for a while but into the gap to the left of short extra-cover;
19.6;1;Amir to Maxwell, 1 run fullish outside off, driven to deep point;
19.5;1;Amir to Wade, 1 run straighter now, on leg stump, flicked to long leg;
19.4;2;Amir to Wade, 2 runs very full, again a hint of possible reverse into the left-hander, towards off stump. Wade clips it away through midwicket;
19.3;1;Amir to Maxwell, 1 run short on middle and off, gets across and whips it away through backward square leg;
19.2;1;Amir to Wade, 1 run back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Shuffles across to work it wide of mid-on;
19.1;?;Amir to Wade, no run back of a length close to off stump, gets back and across to defend back to the bowler;
18.6;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run floated up slow on middle and off, stretches out and rolls his wrists over to play that watchfully to mid-on. Another excellent over from Imad;
18.5;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run back of a length on middle stump, defended back to the bowler;
18.4;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run back of a length, a little closer to off stump, shuffles across and tucks it into the leg side for a risky single. Direct hit would have had Maxwell at the striker's end, but Akmal, moving to his left from midwicket, can't hit the stumps;
18.3;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run back of a length outside off, punched to short extra-cover;
18.2;?;Imad Wasim to Wade, no run fullish, angling away from off stump, gets nicely forward to block it back to the bowler;
18.1;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run length ball swerving in towards off stump, check-driven to long-off;
17.6;1;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover;
17.5;?;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, no run shortish on off stump, defended towards point;
17.4;1;Wahab Riaz to Wade, 1 run length ball, and was that a tiny bit of inward swerve towards middle stump, maybe some seriously early reverse? No worries for Wade just yet, lets it come on and clips quietly through midwicket;
17.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Wade, no run back of a length close to off stump, defended with an open face towards point;
17.3;1w;Wahab Riaz to Wade, 1 wide bouncer, off-target, ends up angling it a fair way down the leg side;

17.1;1;Wahab Riaz to Wade, 1 run shortish outside off, Wade lets it come on and dabs down to third man;
16.6;?;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, no run fired in flat on the stumps, Maxwell shows the full face to defend to midwicket;
16.5;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run sweeps again, against the angle. It's a bit of a risk given the drift Imad gets away from the left-hander, but Wade manages to play it safely enough into the fine leg region;
16.4;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run fullish on leg stump, clipped through square leg;
16.3;1;Imad Wasim to Wade, 1 run slated across, and Wade gets across, gets down low, and lap-sweeps from just outside off, into the short fine-leg region;
16.2;W;Imad Wasim to Marsh, OUT this time there is some turn, and Marsh nicks off! That excellent length again, never quite up there to drive, on off stump. Marsh chances the drive, and only manages a thin edge through to Rizwan;Mitchell Marsh c ?Mohammad Rizwan b Imad Wasim 4 (30m 17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 23.52;
16.1;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run length ball angling into middle and off, no turn. Maxwell shows the full face to push to long-on;
15.6;?;Wahab Riaz to Marsh, no run fullish outside off, defended into the off side, and drinks;
15.5;?;Wahab Riaz to Marsh, no run well left. On a length outside off, left alone. Rizwan fails to collect cleanly, almost hits the helmet positioned behind him;
15.4;1;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 run too straight this time, nudged down to fine leg;
15.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, no run much better. Good length on a fifth-stump line. The ball deviates past the bat;
15.2;4;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, FOUR runs 144 kph, another terrible delivery from Wahab. Short and wide, scythed behind point for four. This isn't good bowling;
15.1;?;Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, no run offcutter on off, played into the leg side;
14.6;?;Imad Wasim to Marsh, no run flat on off and middle, played back;
14.5;1;Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 run short on middle, punched to long-on;

14.1;?;Imad Wasim to Marsh, no run 91 kph, pushed away towards midwicket. Another dot;
13.6;?;Hafeez to Maxwell, no run nice bowling, Slow through the air, some flight outside off, defended. "Jaldi karo," (hurry up) screams Riwan. Not a bad tactic that, get through overs without these two noticing;
13.5;?;Hafeez to Maxwell, no run worked towards square leg;
13.4;?;Hafeez to Maxwell, no run ooh, Maxwell plays for some spin, not much there, a leading edge back to the bowler;
13.3;2;Hafeez to Maxwell, 2 runs short and wide, that's a poor ball. Cut through cover for a couple from the back foot;
13.2;?;Hafeez to Maxwell, no run worked towards midwicket;
13.1;1;Hafeez to Marsh, 1 run flat on middle, pushed out to long-on. An easy single, why give him one there?;
12.6;W;Imad Wasim to Head, OUT edged and gone. Wasim strikes. Pakistan chipping away. Head looked all at sea against the non-turning spin of Wasim. A flat delivery outside off, skids on with the arm again. Head looks to slap a drive through cover but plays inside the line, like he has been doing against Wasim. The ball kisses the outside edge and settles in Rizwan's gloves. Good catch too;Travis Head c ?Mohammad Rizwan b Imad Wasim 39 (61m 39b 5x4 0x6) SR: 100;
12.5;1;Imad Wasim to Marsh, 1 run driven to long-off for one, 102 kph;

9.6;1;Hasan Ali to Head, 1 run fullish, better line, sixth-stump line outside off. A thick outside edge down to third man;
9.5;?;Hasan Ali to Head, no run much much better. Full and straight, 139 kph, Head defends;
9.4;4;Hasan Ali to Head, FOUR runs full and wide again. Tear-your-hair-out bowling. Head leans on this and finds the gap through cover for four more. This time from around the wicket.;
9.3;4;Hasan Ali to Head, FOUR runs full and wide from Hasan. Tripe. Drilled through cover. All timing, lots of power too.;
9.2;W;Hasan Ali to Lynn, OUT that isn't a great shot and Lynn falls. Another BBL stroke. Slower delivery this time, full and wide. Lynn just chooses the wrong shot. Premeditated. Could have clattered that over the off side, but he got down on one knee and slog-swept a drag-flick straight into the air. Rizwan runs around, doesn't look to comfortable underneath the skier but importantly, takes the catch. Had to drag that from too wide.;Chris Lynn c ?Mohammad Rizwan b Hasan Ali 16 (24m 12b 0x4 1x6) SR: 133.33;
9.1;?;Hasan Ali to Lynn, no run 136 kph, on a length around off, pushed back to the bowler;

8.5;?;Wahab Riaz to Head, no run 141 kph, punched towards point. Slightly closer to off.;
8.4;4;Wahab Riaz to Head, FOUR runs oh my, Wahab helping Australia out with a buffet of help-yourself deliveries. I wouldn't mind this. Short and wide again, Head crashes a cut through point for four more.;
8.3;4;Wahab Riaz to Head, FOUR runs short and wide this time, rubbish. Head stands tall and scythes a cut through point this time. Four more.;
8.2;4;Wahab Riaz to Head, FOUR runs poor bowling. Short and wide outside off, Head stays back and drills a back-foot punch through cover. Easily hit;
8.1;1;Wahab Riaz to Lynn, 1 run 143 kph, better, more like it. Back of a length on middle and leg, swatted to deep square leg for one. Hustled Lynn for pace;
8.1;1w;Wahab Riaz to Lynn, 1 wide digs one in on off, so high that it loops over Lynn. Don't have to be so short at the Gabba. A back of a length is ideal here;
7.6;?;Hasan Ali to Head, no run 135 kph, fullish delivery around off, driven to cover from the crease;
7.5;4;Hasan Ali to Head, 4 runs on the pads, poor bowling this. Flicked through midwicket. Such a long boundary that four runs are run with time to spare;
7.4;?;Hasan Ali to Head, no run 137 kph, full and straight, driven to mid-on. No swing for Hasan Ali;
7.3;2;Hasan Ali to Head, 2 runs 140 kph, fullish on off, driven towards cover for a couple more;

7.1;6;Hasan Ali to Lynn, SIX runs smashed. Back of a length from Hasan Ali and Lynn BBL's the ball way into the stands. A heave waaaaay over midwicket. Just so easy for Lynn;

6.5;?;Amir to Head, no run 144 kph, good length a tad wide outside off, cut away towards point;

6.3;1;Amir to Head, 1 run 143 kph, good call from Lynn. Back of a length delivery outside off, the ball swerves back in. A thick inside edge into the pad, towards short leg. Lynn calls Head through even though the batsman has no idea where the ball has gone;
6.2;?;Amir to Head, no run good length outside off, 146 kph, driven towards cover from the back foot;
6.1;?;Amir to Head, no run full and straight from Amir, Head is hanging on the back foot but is able to defend;
5.6;?;Hasan Ali to Lynn, no run big appeal! No says the umpire. Good length delivery around off, the ball nips back in and cuts Lynn in half. A noise, probably off the thigh pad, on its way to the keeper.;
5.5;?;Hasan Ali to Lynn, no run nice. A good length on off, pushed away towards mid-off;
5.5;1w;Hasan Ali to Lynn, 1 wide bouncer on off, too short. Lynn gets underneath. Wide called;
5.4;4;Hasan Ali to Lynn, 4 runs creamed through cover. Full and wide from Hasan. Lynn thrashes his drive to cover who half-stops the ball. Parried away towards the deep cover boundary. Azhar chases it down, but four runs are run;

4.5;?;Amir to Lynn, no run nicely bowled from Amir. Full and straight, some inswing. Lynn flicks to square leg;
4.4;W;Amir to Smith, OUT edged and gone! Another peach from Amir. Fantastic captaincy from Azhar, after all the flak he's received. Bowls it full and wide. Asks Smith to drive through the vacant cover region. Smith can't say no with his form, can he? His feet are rooted in the crease, his drive is away from his body. The ball holds its line outside off and takes the edge. A routine catch for Rizwan.;Steven Smith c ?Mohammad Rizwan b Mohammad Amir 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
4.3;W;Amir to Warner, OUT what a delivery! He has been doing it all afternoon. Superb bowling. Amir pushes this one fuller and straighter. Warner sees something on middle and chooses to flick into the leg side but is undone by substantial away swing. The ball beats the flick by some distance and clips the top of the bails. Wow, he wasn't close to that. Not a great shot.;David Warner b Mohammad Amir 7 (19m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.88;

3.3;1;Hafeez to Head, 1 run this is a tad too full and Head smashes an on-drive to long-on;
3.2;?;Hafeez to Head, no run slow through the air, a bit of loop an drift. Pushed back;
3.1;?;Hafeez to Head, no run flat and wide outside off, hit hard to extra cover;
2.6;?;Amir to Warner, no run another one. 144 kph. Superb bowling. Warner had enough, stayed in the crease and attempted a leaden-footed uppish drive but there is some swing, the ball pitches and moves away to beat the outside edge again.;
2.5;?;Amir to Warner, no run jaffa. Takes something similar to beat Warner. Good length on off, the ball swerves away and beats the outside edge. Warner's feet were rooted in the crease;
2.4;1;Amir to Head, 1 run dabbed down to third man with an angled bat. Not much movement of the feet;
2.3;1;Amir to Warner, 1 run there is Warner's first. Full delivery, straight, a thick inside edge down to fine leg. Nice length this from Amir, seeing if the ball will swing;
2.2;?;Amir to Warner, no run 145 kph, good length on middle, inside-edged towards square leg. Warner still on 0;
2.1;1;Amir to Head, 1 run 142 kph, good length delivery moving away, a thick outside skew races down to third man. Just one;

1.3;?;Hafeez to Warner, no run nice. Flat on off, no turn. Warner goes back, chops the ball towards point;
1.2;1;Hafeez to Head, 1 run another naughty full toss on off, driven down towards mid-off for a quick run. Hafeez hasn't done too much bowling in the recent past;
1.1;?;Hafeez to Head, no run not nice. A low full toss to start, drilled to cover;
0.6;?;Amir to Warner, no run 143 kph, pushed towards cover off the good length. A nice gentle push. Lovely start from Amir;
0.5;?;Amir to Warner, no run 141 kph good length outside off, prodded into the off side. Good lines these;
0.5;1w;Amir to Warner, 1 wide the first wayward one of the day. Back of a length down leg, Warner leaves. A wide called;
0.4;?;Amir to Warner, no run 143 kph, another defensive nudge into the off side towards point;
0.3;?;Amir to Warner, no run lovely stuff from Amir. Nice and full on off, inviting the ball to swing. Warner defends to mid-off;
0.2;?;Amir to Warner, no run a tad wider this time. Good length outside off, some movement. Away swing. Warner wafts and the ball goes past. Warner has had his problems against Boult, the ball moving away.;
0.1;?;Amir to Warner, no run nice start. 139 kph, good length delivery on off, the ball seaming away. Warner can only defend. Keep six there.;

1.18pm Righto, Australia's newest ODI opening pair: Warner and Travis Head. The Gabba's surface is almost never untrue. Nice carry, good bounce, sensational batting conditions. Amir has the ball. Two slips in place. And the usual ODi field. A third man, a fine leg.
1.10pm Almost imperative that Pakistan start the game well. It's the first of five ODIs, and a strong performance will set them up. Pakistan were appalling in the ODI series against England from the outset.
12.50pm Australia have won the toss and opt to bat. Not the greatest of starts to the ODIs for Pakistan.
Here's Australia's XI: Warner, Head, Smith, Lynn, Marsh, Maxwell, Wade, Faulkner, Cummins, Starc, Stanlake. Quite a few changes to their last ODI against New Zealand: Maxwell and the two debutants will feature today. No front-line spinner for Australia, Head and Maxwell will fill in a few overs of offspin.
Pakistan: Azhar, Sharjeel, Hafeez, Babar, Akmal, Rizwan, Wasim, Nawaz, Amir, Wahab, Hasan. No Malik for Pakistan? Almost incomprehensible considering he is one of their best batsmen. Chosen youth over experience, a move I totally disagree with.
SEKHAR : "Junaid Khan was in impressive form in the Bangladesh Premier League. Sad that he has to miss out"
faizan: ""News is that Shoaib Malik has a throat infection, so he misses this game.""
Muhammad Seemab: "No Shoaib Malik... Who has experience of BBL even and hafeez who didn't play for a long time in Australia. Big call"
Haris Ahmad: "Shoaib Malik's absence doesn't make sense to me, he's a solid veteran presence who can bat well and is handy for a few overs as well"
Ethan: "Australia bat all the way down to 10, thinking this has something to do with the nature of their line up and probably indicates their intentions on the style of cricket they want to play."
12.48pm A terrific day to win the toss and just bat, bat and bat.
12.44pm It's a fantastic day in Brisbane. Even more so if you're making your debut. Chris Lynn and Billy Stanlake have been given their ODI caps by Jimmy Maher and Carl Rackemann respectively.
Haris Ahmad: "Sharjeel Khan will be the key for Pakistan, if he gets it going their chances go up tremendously"
kn: "Finch and Bailey were both very impressive in the big bash last night, I wonder if the selectors were a bit premature in dropping the pair."
Nipa: "Has Australia confused this game with a T20? Warner, Head, Lynn, Maxwell and Marsh... All great hitters, but only Smith has the temperment to steady the ship if wickets fall. Seem to be missing an Usman or Bailey."
Malhar : "Warner and Head to open today! "
12.40pm Australia has included a couple of new faces in this squad, primarily on stupendous BBL performances, Chris Lynn is one of 'em.
Samiboi: "Looking forward to this I feel the mercurial unbeatable Pakistan is gonna turn up today"
12.30pm Pakistan received a resounding thrashing in the Tests, their strongest format. Australia are on top of their game, in form and getting increasingly confident after a diffident start to their summer. This ain't going to be an easy series for the visitors, especially because they've lost some of their key personnel. The greater the adversity, greater the win, I suppose. It's time for the Gabba ODI and the start of the five-match ODI series between Australia and Pakistan.

9.05pm And that is that. Australia go 1-0 up in the series, and showed they have what it takes to win even when their powerful top order fails to click. How will Pakistan respond? Join us day after tomorrow at the MCG to find out. Until then, goodbye!
Presentation time. Matthew Wade is, as expected, the Player of the Match. "Feels great," he says. "It was challenging at the top, it was swinging and seaming around. Maxi took the pressure off me, and I was just looking to get him on strike. I was absolutely cooked (by the last over). They were taking the pace off, I was swinging way too hard. If the spinners bowled into the wicket it was hard to hit them down the ground."
Azhar Ali: "It's a bit sore, but hopefully it will recover soon. The physio will have a better look and see how far I can get. Hopefully I can take part in the next game. I think full credit to the bowlers, first half it was very good, but obviously credit goes to Matthew Wade the way he batted. We thought from five down for 78 we can get them out early, but unfortunately it didn't happen. It was still chaseable but we needed to have good partnerships up front."
Steven Smith: "It was a pretty average start. We were in a bit of a hurry, to be fair. I thought Matthew Wade played an exceptional innings. 270 was around par, it was a bit of a slow wicket. We bat all the way down. Starcy is batting at No. 10 at the moment. We've got a long order. If we come off we're going to make some big scores. We need to be a bit smarter at the top. We bowled good areas all night, took the pace off well, got the job done."
Stuart: "Faulkner didn't do his magic with the bat but has done very well with the ball."
Crickfan: "If Malik and Sarfraz were there, they would be rebuilding the innings instead of giving their wicket away" -- Unfortunate for Pakistan that neither was available today.
Hamza: "Its high time for azhar ali to go....It was a pathetic selection...getting hafeez in place of malik when you already have to off spinners..." -- Shoaib Malik was ill. That's why Pakistan couldn't pick him today. I'm guessing Nawaz wouldn't have played had Malik been fit.
8.50pm Pakistan started fairly okay, and were hamstrung (literally) by Azhar Ali retiring hurt just after he had lost his opening partner. They still seemed reasonably on course when Babar Azam and Umar Akmal were at the crease, but they simply stagnated after that partnership came to an end. Australia's various pace options bowled skillfully, used the slower balls excellently against the lower order, but by then the match was done. Australia, remember, were 5 for 78 at one stage. Thanks to Matthew Wade, and Glenn Maxwell before him, they set a target of 269.
42.4;W;Cummins to Wahab Riaz, OUT length ball, slower ball, wide of off stump. Wahab slogs, he has to. Wants to hit over mid-off, but again, can't get any power into it. Mid-off moves a few steps to his left and backwards, and takes a comfortable catch to wrap up a 92-run win;Wahab Riaz c Starc b Cummins 6 (12m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 75;
42.3;1;Cummins to Hasan Ali, 1 run slower ball, fairly full and straight, clipped with the angle through midwicket;
42.2;1;Cummins to Wahab Riaz, 1 run low full-toss on middle stump, swiped to long-on;
42.1;?;Cummins to Wahab Riaz, no run yorker, angling down leg. Wahab looks to get his feet out of the way and flick, but can't put bat to ball;
41.6;1;Faulkner to Wahab Riaz, 1 run another slower ball, worked into the leg side;
41.5;2;Faulkner to Wahab Riaz, 2 runs Wahab's on strike, though. Faulkner continues from over the wicket, slants a slower ball across him. Looks to drive it over extra-cover, doesn't get any power on it, and it just eludes the fingertips of the leaping, backtracking Smith;
41.4;W;Faulkner to Amir, OUT another slower ball, another swipe from Amir, wanting to hit over the covers. He manages to hit it in the intended direction, but without the intended power, and extra-cover takes a couple of steps back and lets the ball fall into his cupped hands;Mohammad Amir c Maxwell b Faulkner 8 (14m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80;
41.3;2;Faulkner to Amir, 2 runs full and wide, another slower ball. Amir slices underneath the ball again and sends it looping over point;
41.2;1;Faulkner to Wahab Riaz, 1 run interesting shot. Slower ball, full, on off stump, and he gets down on his knee and sweeps to long-on;
41.1;1;Faulkner to Amir, 1 run slower ball, shortish outside off. No pace on it at all. Amir wanted to flat-bat through point, only manages to chop it into the ground and send it rolling into the covers;
40.6;?;Cummins to Wahab Riaz, no run yorker on middle stump. Wahab does well to dig it out, inside-edges into his pad;
40.5;1;Cummins to Amir, 1 run full on middle stump. Makes room and flat-bats to long-off;
40.4;?;Cummins to Amir, no run in the blockhole now, jabbed back to the bowler;
40.3;2;Cummins to Amir, 2 runs fuller now, on off stump, scoops it in the air and lands the ball in the centre of the ever-shrinking triangle formed by long-off, extra-cover, and sweeper cover;
40.2;?;Cummins to Amir, no run back of a length, offcutter. Looks to make room and steer to third man, can't put bat to ball. Just bounces over the bails;
40.1;1;Cummins to Wahab Riaz, 1 run full on off stump, driven into the covers;
39.6;W;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, OUT and he goes next ball. Looks to manufacture a shot off a length ball angling into him. Wants to hit that over short leg, I guess, but it's the slower ball, and he's through his shot too early and hits it down the throat of Warner running in from deep square leg;Azhar Ali c Warner b Faulkner 24 (78m 48b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
39.5;?;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, no run dropped. Full on off and middle. Azhar looks to whack it down the ground again, and hits it hard, back to the bowler, who gets his hands to it to his right but can't hold on;

41.5;2;Faulkner to Wahab Riaz, 2 runs Wahab's on strike, though. Faulkner continues from over the wicket, slants a slower ball across him. Looks to drive it over extra-cover, doesn't get any power on it, and it just eludes the fingertips of the leaping, backtracking Smith;
41.4;W;Faulkner to Amir, OUT another slower ball, another swipe from Amir, wanting to hit over the covers. He manages to hit it in the intended direction, but without the intended power, and extra-cover takes a couple of steps back and lets the ball fall into his cupped hands;Mohammad Amir c Maxwell b Faulkner 8 (14m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80;

40.1;1;Cummins to Wahab Riaz, 1 run full on off stump, driven into the covers;
39.6;W;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, OUT and he goes next ball. Looks to manufacture a shot off a length ball angling into him. Wants to hit that over short leg, I guess, but it's the slower ball, and he's through his shot too early and hits it down the throat of Warner running in from deep square leg;Azhar Ali c Warner b Faulkner 24 (78m 48b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
39.5;?;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, no run dropped. Full on off and middle. Azhar looks to whack it down the ground again, and hits it hard, back to the bowler, who gets his hands to it to his right but can't hold on;

39.3;1;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, 1 run fullish on off stump, flat-batted to long-off;
39.2;1;Faulkner to Amir, 1 run slower length ball wide of off, sliced in the air, on the bounce, to the left of deep point;
39.1;1;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, 1 run short, Faulkner's around-the-wicket angle cramps Azhar for room as he looks to hit through the off side. Ends up slapping it into the covers without really freeing his arms;
38.6;?;Marsh to Amir, no run length ball slanted wide of off. Amir slogs and misses. Wanted to hammer that over mid-off, I guess;
38.5;1;Marsh to Azhar Ali, 1 run short outside off, slapped away to the left of deep point;
38.4;?;Marsh to Azhar Ali, no run Now Azhar tries to step across and scoop over the keeper. Can't get bat to ball, and the ball bounces over off stump;
38.3;W;Marsh to Imad Wasim, OUT gone. Slower short ball, and Imad can't get any real power on this pull. Hits it high, towards Warner, who runs in from the midwicket boundary to complete a simple catch;Imad Wasim c Warner b Marsh 29 (54m 36b 1x4 1x6) SR: 80.55;
38.2;?;Marsh to Imad Wasim, no run ooh. Wasim stepped away from the stumps at first, then went across them, in an effort to put the bowler off. He just bowls a regulation length ball, and Imad misses the attempted ramp over short fine leg. Ball bounces over the top of the stumps;
38.1;1;Marsh to Azhar Ali, 1 run short outside off, Azhar beats midwicket diving to his right with a topspin-smash pull;
37.6;1;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, 1 run cramps him again, but this time he works it off his body through backward square leg;
37.5;?;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, no run sees Azhar making room and bowls it shorter and at the body. Jabbed back to the bowler;
37.4;1;Faulkner to Imad Wasim, 1 run foxes him with the slower one immediately. Length ball outside off, and Imad is on the front foot, reaching for it. Checks himself, and ends up sending it ballooning softly into the air, to the right of cover. Somehow falls safely despite Maxwell's best efforts to chase it down;
37.3;1;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, 1 run length ball on off stump. Azhar uses the angle to clip it to long-on, hitting uppishly for a moment but well to the left of the straight midwicket fielder;
37.2;?;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length, a bit of inward movement to cramp Azhar. He was looking to hit through the off side, and had to adjust and try to whip into the leg side. Inside-edges into his thigh pad;
37.1;?;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, no run short outside off, Azhar dabs to short third man;
36.6;2;Marsh to Imad Wasim, 2 runs down the track now. Marsh shortens his length and Imad pulls over the leaping fielder at midwicket;
36.5;4;Marsh to Imad Wasim, FOUR runs short, angling away from off stump, cleverly played by Imad. Makes himself room and almost lets it pass him before slicing under it to stab it to the fine third-man boundary;
36.4;1;Marsh to Azhar Ali, 1 run short on off stump, pulled to long-on;
36.3;1;Marsh to Imad Wasim, 1 run back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room and slashes to deep point;

35.6;1;Head to Azhar Ali, 1 run fired in on the pads, clipped to fine leg;
35.5;?;Head to Azhar Ali, no run flat and full on middle and leg. Azhar closes his bat face too early while trying to flick, gets a leading edge back to the bowler, on the bounce, though;
35.4;1;Head to Imad Wasim, 1 run back of a length outside off, jabbed into the cover point region;
35.3;?;Head to Imad Wasim, no run fuller, blocked back to the bowler;
35.2;?;Head to Imad Wasim, no run quicker, flatter, back of a length on off stump, shuffles across to try and work it leg side, but he's hurried by the pace of it and can only do so defensively;
35.1;?;Head to Imad Wasim, no run tossed up on off stump, driven back to Head;
34.6;1;Starc to Imad Wasim, 1 run full-toss on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg;

34.2;?;Starc to Imad Wasim, no run full on off stump, driven to mid-off;
34.1;?;Starc to Imad Wasim, no run back of a length outside off, reaches out to punch to backward point;
33.6;?;Head to Azhar Ali, no run looks to sweep, and from the line of the stumps at that. Misses, and Wade's humongous appeal is turned down. Australia have used up their review; will be interesting to see that again. Did he get a bottom edge on it? Pitching on off, not turning enough to hit the stumps, according to Hawkeye;
33.5;1;Head to Imad Wasim, 1 run back of a length on off stump, pokes to the left of point and Azhar, somehow, responds to his partner's call and gets to the striker's end;
33.4;1;Head to Azhar Ali, 1 run down the track now, not quite to the pitch of the ball and has to hit squarer than he'd like. All along the ground to deep square leg;
33.3;?;Head to Azhar Ali, no run full on middle stump, clipped to midwicket;
33.2;?;Head to Azhar Ali, no run tossed up outside off, floated across the right-hander. Driven back to the bowler;
33.1;1;Head to Imad Wasim, 1 run shortish outside off, makes some room to stab that to deep point;
32.6;2;Starc to Azhar Ali, 2 runs full on off stump, clipped with the angle, wide of mid-on. Could have run three had he been able to. He's still got problems with his leg, however, so he only gets two;
32.5;W;Starc to Nawaz, OUT bowled him! It was threatening to happen all through this over, and Starc finally gets one in the perfect spot. Full, swinging in, not a yorker, though. Nawaz slogs and misses, Starc hits off stump;Mohammad Nawaz b Starc 1 (10m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.11;
32.4;?;Starc to Nawaz, no run back of a length, tailing in late towards middle and leg. No room for Nawaz to work with, he just stands there and tucks it defensively into the leg side;
32.4;1w;Starc to Nawaz, 1 wide looks for the yorker again, slants it down the leg side this time;
32.3;?;Starc to Nawaz, no run very full again, jabbed to short extra-cover;
32.2;?;Starc to Nawaz, no run yorker, sweves in late and hits Nawaz on the foot as he looks to flick, possibly on the full too. Polite appeal from Starc, he knew that was missing leg stump;
32.1;?;Starc to Nawaz, no run back of a length, angling into the left-hander and tucking him up for room. Gets up on his toes to defend;
31.6;1;Head to Nawaz, 1 run back of a length on the stumps, pushed gently into the off side for one;
31.5;?;Head to Nawaz, no run in the blockhole, pitches outside leg. Looks to get his front foot out of the way and flick, can't connect;
31.4;1;Head to Imad Wasim, 1 run back of a length, goes with the angle towards middle stump. Makes room to stab towards point;
31.3;?;Head to Imad Wasim, no run slower, more flight, slogs and inside-edges into his front pad;

30.6;?;Cummins to Nawaz, no run bouncer, Nawaz ducks under it;
30.5;?;Cummins to Nawaz, no run back of a length on middle and off, defended back to the bowler;
30.4;1;Cummins to Imad Wasim, 1 run length ball outside off, Imad pokes at it without really moving his feet, gets a thick edge down to the right of third man;
30.3;?;Cummins to Imad Wasim, no run back of a length outside off, dabbed to backward point;
30.2;?;Cummins to Imad Wasim, no run short, angling away from the left-hander, left alone;
30.1;W;Cummins to Rizwan, OUT And a wicket, immediately. Bangs it in. Rizwan has to pull from over his right shoulder, and he takes it on, ends up skewing it high, and Marsh, running to his left from deep midwicket, takes an excellent catch. He reaches overhead with both hands, first, then the ball bounces out, and he manages to catch it on the rebound, with his left hand, while tumbling to the floor;Mohammad Rizwan c Marsh b Cummins 21 (53m 44b 0x4 0x6) SR: 47.72;
29.6;1lb;Head to Rizwan, 1 leg bye on the pads, off the pads for one to fine leg;
29.5;?;Head to Rizwan, no run should have been one there. Driven past cover and to mid-off, but they don't take the run;
29.4;1;Head to Imad Wasim, 1 run pushed off the back foot to deep point. Wasim looking on point straightaway;
29.3;1;Head to Rizwan, 1 run builds pressure on himself. Flat on leg, goes for a big sweep, a thick top edge lands safely in front of fine leg;
29.2;?;Head to Rizwan, no run defended off the front foot. Rizwan's strike rate is 50 after 40 balls;
29.1;1;Head to Imad Wasim, 1 run short and wide, scythed to deep point;
28.6;?;Cummins to Rizwan, no run another dot. Just too many from Rizwan. Full on off, driven towards cover. Australia have bowled well to him;
28.5;?;Cummins to Rizwan, no run full and straight, pushed away to mid-on. Nice bowling;
28.4;1;Cummins to Imad Wasim, 1 run a top-edged pull down to fine leg for a run. Well-directed bouncer, on off, moving away;
28.3;?;Cummins to Imad Wasim, no run 145 kph, pushed wider outside off, left alone;
28.2;?;Cummins to Imad Wasim, no run 145 kph, full and wide, left alone. Afforded him the luxury of that with the first ball;
28.1;6;Cummins to Imad Wasim, SIX runs oh yea. Shot! In the slot for Wasim and boom. A nice clean swing from Wasim sends the ball straight over the bowler's head for six. Superlative timing.;
27.6;2;Head to Rizwan, 2 runs another fine sweep for a couple more in the same area. Much better from Rizwan;
27.5;2;Head to Rizwan, 2 runs a fine paddle sweep down to fine leg for a couple;
27.4;?;Head to Rizwan, no run runs down and plays the ball towards cover via his body;

27.1;1;Head to Imad Wasim, 1 run on the pads to start, flicked through square leg for one;
26.6;2;Marsh to Rizwan, 2 runs gets it through this time. Just two, wow. Should have been three there. Full and straight, Rizwan runs down at Marsh and shovels the ball through midwicket off the inside half.;
26.5;1;Marsh to Imad Wasim, 1 run full and wide, 134 kph, a toe-ended drive races down to third man;

25.6;?;Cummins to Imad Wasim, no run back of a length outside off, 145 kph. Wasim lets it go;
25.5;W;Cummins to Babar Azam, OUT Azam was looking so good, then he does this. A stroke fraught with so much risk with a slip in place. Back of a length from Cummins, seaming back in. Azam tries to steer the ball to third man for one. The inward movement helps the ball rap the glove and just lob to Smith at slip. An easy catch. But well bowled too. Got some bounce and extra oomph in his delivery.;Babar Azam c Smith b Cummins 33 (70m 46b 3x4 0x6) SR: 71.73;
25.4;2;Cummins to Babar Azam, 2 runs just past leg stump for a couple. Fullish on a fifth-stump line. Azam's waft results in a thick inside edge which misses the stumps;
25.3;1;Cummins to Rizwan, 1 run good length outside off, chopped into the ground and over slip for a run to third man. Not sure what he was trying to do there, ungainly;
25.2;?;Cummins to Rizwan, no run another dot, fullish outside off, pushed to mid-off;
25.1;?;Cummins to Rizwan, no run lovely stroke, equally good fielding. Full outside off, Rizwan times his drive to cover, Lynn dives to his right to field;

24.5;?;Marsh to Rizwan, no run 135 kph, nice finish from Marsh. Fullish delivery outside off, seaming back in. Strikes Rizwan on the pads but going well over the stumps;
24.4;1;Marsh to Babar Azam, 1 run another deft dab towards third man. Azam finding his range slowly;
24.3;1;Marsh to Rizwan, 1 run nice. Good length delivery outside off, dabbed down to third man for one;
24.2;?;Marsh to Rizwan, no run 133 kph, full and wide, RIzwan misses his drive. May have been undone by some seam movement;
24.1;1;Marsh to Babar Azam, 1 run short and wide from Marsh, slapped through cover for a run;
23.6;2;Head to Rizwan, 2 runs a fine paddle sweep to fine leg for a couple more. Four from it, a decent over for both sides;
23.5;1;Head to Babar Azam, 1 run flat on middle and leg, pushed to long-on;
23.4;?;Head to Babar Azam, no run comes down to the pitch and badly mis-times his drive to mid-off. Too close to the pitch;

22.4;1;Marsh to Rizwan, 1 run 138 kph, short down leg, pulled down to fine leg for a run.;
22.3;1;Marsh to Babar Azam, 1 run well played. Back of a length on off, Azam gets on top of the bounce and pulls to deep square leg;
22.2;?;Marsh to Babar Azam, no run nice stroke. Overpitched on off, pushed away towards mid-on with the full face. This asking rate climbing quietly;
22.1;?;Marsh to Babar Azam, no run good lines from Marsh. Rather close to off on a good length, defended into the off side;
21.6;?;Head to Rizwan, no run a solid forward defensive shot. Another tidy over from Head, just one off it;
21.5;?;Head to Rizwan, no run nicely bowled, slow on off, some spin back in, Rizwan defends;
21.4;?;Head to Rizwan, no run;
21.3;?;Head to Rizwan, no run driven towards cover;
21.2;?;Head to Rizwan, no run a wide almost turns into a wicket. Flat delivery down leg, Rizwan wanted to paddle sweep, but toe-ends it towards square leg. Lands in front of Maxwell;

18.3;4;Starc to Babar Azam, FOUR runs that's a poor ball though. Drifts down leg, nudged down to the fine leg boundary;
18.2;?;Starc to Babar Azam, no run 147 kph, good length delivery outside off, Babar wafts and is beaten. The ball climbs and climbs. Whew, exaggerated bounce;
18.1;1;Starc to Rizwan, 1 run full and wide outside off, a thick outside edge races down to third man;

16.6;?;Starc to Rizwan, no run looking for the yorker, gets it wrong, low full toss driven to mid-on;
16.5;W;Starc to Umar Akmal, OUT gone! Akmal has played another terrible stroke. What was he trying to do? Clear mid-on with a pull? Poor choice of stroke. Back of a length from Starc outside off, hustles Akmal for pace. Akmal tries to forehand the ball into the leg side but may have been too late to the ball. Splices the ball straight to mid-on, who takes an easy catch. Ooh, actually that may have been the offcutter.;Umar Akmal c Head b Starc 17 (29m 25b 3x4 0x6) SR: 68;
16.4;1;Starc to Babar Azam, 1 run pace off the ball, 128 kph, a thick outside-halved drive to third man for a run;
16.3;1;Starc to Umar Akmal, 1 run poor line. On the pads, flicked down to fine leg for a run;
16.2;4;Starc to Umar Akmal, FOUR runs 147 kph, much better shot. Gets a low full toss on middle, worked through midwicket for four. Just a clip;
16.1;?;Starc to Umar Akmal, no run yikes. What waaaas thaaat? Full and wide outside off, Akmal runs at Starc and aims to send him into the long-on stands. Misses;
15.6;1;Head to Umar Akmal, 1 run uses his feet, gets there and drives past the bowler for a run to long-on;
15.5;?;Head to Umar Akmal, no run flat on middle and leg, inside-edged towards square leg;
15.4;1;Head to Babar Azam, 1 run flat on middle, punched to long-on off the back foot;
15.3;?;Head to Babar Azam, no run just short of midwicket. A lazy stroke. Flight on leg, Azam gets forward and clips the ball towards midwicket;
15.2;?;Head to Babar Azam, no run quick and flat on leg, defended into the leg side;
15.1;?;Head to Babar Azam, no run flight outside off, driven to mid-off;
14.6;?;Starc to Umar Akmal, no run fullish delivery outside off, pushed towards mid-on;
14.5;2;Starc to Umar Akmal, 2 runs that's a nice stroke. A bouncer on middle and leg, Akmal plays his pull nicely, gets on top of the bounce and controls the shot through backward square leg for a couple;
14.4;?;Starc to Umar Akmal, no run a slower ball at 123 kph outside off, pushed to mid-off;
14.3;4;Starc to Umar Akmal, FOUR runs loose shot. Full and wide from Starc, probably there to play but Akmal moves his feet nowhere, throws his hands at that. A thick outside edge flies over gully;
14.2;?;Starc to Umar Akmal, no run full and straight, tailing away late but Akmal manages an awkward defensive stroke;
14.1;?;Starc to Umar Akmal, no run on a length just outside off, Akmal gets forward to defend;
13.6;?;Cummins to Babar Azam, no run shortish outside off, chopped to backward point;
13.5;?;Cummins to Babar Azam, no run back of a length close to off stump, plays nice and late to defend into the backward point region;
13.4;?;Cummins to Babar Azam, no run bouncer, angling into the batsman and not getting up all that high. Babar does very well to duck quickly and duck low to get under it;
13.3;1;Cummins to Umar Akmal, 1 run length ball close to off stump, driven to the left of mid-off with a bottom-handed whip;
13.2;?;Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-on;
13.1;1;Cummins to Babar Azam, 1 run in the blockhole close to off stump, opens his bat face to jab it through backward point;
12.6;2lb;Faulkner to Umar Akmal, 2 leg byes shuffles across to this slower ball, misses the flick. Huuuuuge lbw appeal from Faulkner, not given. Looked like it pitched outside leg, but Australia have reviewed. Big shuffle from Akmal. Did that pitch in line? No bat on it, certainly. Pitching juuust outside leg;
12.5;4;Faulkner to Umar Akmal, FOUR runs bam. Umar had faced nine dot balls, and he had had enough. Length ball on off stump, in the slot for him to clear his front leg and heave that down the ground, to the left of mid-on;
12.4;3;Faulkner to Babar Azam, 3 runs back of a length on off stump, gets back and across and clips it through square leg;
12.3;?;Faulkner to Babar Azam, no run full outside off, driven to mid-off;
12.2;?;Faulkner to Babar Azam, no run back of a length on off stump, defended into the point region;
12.1;4;Faulkner to Babar Azam, FOUR runs shot! Length ball on off stump, and that is technical perfection. Gets a good stride forward, gets his left elbow high, shows the bowler the sticker on his bat, and sends it racing away past his dive to the left;
11.6;?;Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run back of a length, close to off stump, defended into the covers;
11.5;?;Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run back of a length on off stump, dabs into the off side and calls for a single, but point runs in quickly to field it and Babar sends him back;
11.4;?;Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run short outside off, not enough width for an attacking shot. Jumps to ride the bounce and jabs to point;
11.3;?;Cummins to Umar Akmal, no run back of a length on middle stump, defended to mid-on;
11.2;3;Cummins to Babar Azam, 3 runs full outside off, this time he gets just enough width to be able to place his checked drive in the gap between mid-off and extra-cover;
11.1;?;Cummins to Babar Azam, no run length ball outside off, steep bounce to the keeper after Babar leaves;
10.6;?;Faulkner to Umar Akmal, no run back of a length on off stump, defended to short extra;
10.5;?;Faulkner to Umar Akmal, no run back of a length on middle stump, shuffles across to tuck it to midwicket;

10.3;?;Faulkner to Umar Akmal, no run back of a length on off stump, defended off the back foot into the off side;
10.2;?;Faulkner to Umar Akmal, no run length ball angling away from off stump. Akmal comes forward to defend, gets a thick inside edge into his front pad;
10.1;W;Faulkner to Hafeez, OUT Whoops, not a great shot. Excellent length from Faulkner, inviting the drive without necessarily being driveable. Bowls it wide enough to entice Hafeez into the shot. Doesn't get his weight into it in time, is a little late getting fully forward, and only manages a thin edge;Mohammad Hafeez c ?Wade b Faulkner 4 (11m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;
9.6;?;Cummins to Babar Azam, no run full, close to off stump, that is excellent timing but his drive is a little too close to mid-off to get him any runs. Fielder only needed to move a couple of steps to his left;
9.5;?;Cummins to Babar Azam, no run full on off stump, driven to mid-off;
9.4;4;Cummins to Babar Azam, FOUR runs short, wide, and Babar puts it away, slapping it through cover point;
9.3;3;Cummins to Hafeez, 3 runs strays on to middle and leg and Hafeez plays a sweet little pick-up shot over square leg. Faulkner chases from long leg and puts in a despairing dive to stop it at the boundary;
9.3;1w;Cummins to Hafeez, 1 wide bouncer over off stump, Azhar ducks but he doesn't need to. Rises well over head height;
9.2;?;Cummins to Hafeez, no run length ball angling in towards off stump, defended to mid-on;
9.1;?;Cummins to Hafeez, no run fullish on off stump, punched back with the full face showing and Cummins fields in his follow-through, bending down quickly and stopping it with his right hand;

8.5;?;Faulkner to Babar Azam, no run back of a length on middle and off, defended to mid-off;
8.4;1;Faulkner to Hafeez, 1 run back of a length outside off, punched pleasingly to the right of point;
8.3;?;Faulkner to Hafeez, no run a bit wider now, Hafeez leaves again;
8.2;?;Faulkner to Hafeez, no run length ball slanting away from off stump, Hafeez leaves;
8.1;W;Faulkner to Sharjeel, OUT gone, gone. Full outside off, and Sharjeel has been struggling for timing right through this innings. Doesn't connect cleanly with his hit down the ground, gets neither the desired elevation nor placement, and he hits it straight to Maxwell at mid-on;Sharjeel Khan c Maxwell b Faulkner 18 (45m 22b 1x4 1x6) SR: 81.81;
7.6;?;Cummins to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length close to off stump, punched back to the bowler;
7.5;?;Cummins to Azhar Ali, no run short, not enough width to cut, Azhar has to play with an angled bat and it zips past his outside edge;
7.4;?;Cummins to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers;
7.3;2;Cummins to Azhar Ali, 2 runs full on middle and leg, drives with a straight bat to the left of midwicket. And becomes the latest player afflicted by the cramp epidemic as he turns to run a second. Hobbles it instead;
7.3;1w;Cummins to Azhar Ali, 1 wide short and very wide. Azhar can't connect as he reaches out and attempts a slash;
7.2;?;Cummins to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length on off stump, looks to use his wrists to work that through the leg side. Can't get it as square as he likes, because it bounces more than he expects, and he adjusts to play it down defensively into the midwicket region;
7.1;?;Cummins to Azhar Ali, no run shortish outside off, gets on his toes and defends towards point;
6.6;?;Faulkner to Sharjeel, no run length ball on off stump, defended into the covers;
6.5;?;Faulkner to Sharjeel, no run length ball outside off, doesn't really get forward to drive, just throws his hands at it and fails to connect;
6.4;4;Faulkner to Sharjeel, FOUR runs looks like the slower ball outside off, gives Sharjeel the one thing he craves above everything else. Hitting room. Holds his shape nicely, keeps his head still, and hits that in the air, in the gap between mid-on and midwicket;
6.3;1;Faulkner to Azhar Ali, 1 run shortish, angling across Azhar. Waits on it and dabs it down to the left of backward point;
6.2;1;Faulkner to Sharjeel, 1 run length ball, nips back in from outside off. Half stride forward to defend, adjusts to the movement and knocks it gently into the on side for a quick single;
6.1;?;Faulkner to Sharjeel, no run fullish on off stump, driven to mid-on;
5.6;?;Stanlake to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length on middle stump, defended to mid-on;
5.5;?;Stanlake to Azhar Ali, no run short, rising ball angling in towards off stump. Azhar jumps to get on top of the bounce and keep his defensive shot down into the leg side;
5.4;1lb;Stanlake to Sharjeel, 1 leg bye oh man. He's almost headed that to third man. Bouncer angling across him, rising to head high. Very awkward to evade. In the end he dropped his wrists and ducked his head while looking away, and it hits the top of the helmet and ricochets to third man. It's taken off the rim of one of the air inlets;
5.3;3;Stanlake to Azhar Ali, 3 runs strays on the pads, Azhar flicks to the left of long leg;
5.2;1;Stanlake to Sharjeel, 1 run length ball on middle and off, clipped away through square leg;
5.1;6;Stanlake to Sharjeel, SIX runs Taken! But he's caught it beyond the boundary. That was a length ball, angling across towards off stump, and Sharjeel shovels that against the angle, up and over long leg, and Starc leaps backwards, over the rope, and takes an impressive but inconsequential one-handed catch;
4.6;1;Starc to Sharjeel, 1 run overpitched again, on off stump. Times this clip crisply, but it's close enough to mid-on for him to stop it with a dive to his left;
4.5;?;Starc to Sharjeel, no run short outside off, not much width. Jumps to ride the bounce and chop it down to short cover;
4.4;2;Starc to Sharjeel, 2 runs overpitched, a bit of width too, Sharjeel plays a checked drive to the right of mid-off. Didn't quite middle it, it seemed to hit the inside half of his bat;
4.3;2;Starc to Sharjeel, 2 runs fuller now, on off stump, clipped in the air, with the angle, towards the midwicket boundary. Slows down considerably after landing;
4.2;?;Starc to Sharjeel, no run length ball angling into middle stump, defended to mid-on;
4.1;?;Starc to Sharjeel, no run back of a length, and it nips in and cuts Sharjeel in half as he plays a leaden-footed push from the crease. He's saved by bounce. It didn't miss the top of middle stump by much.;
3.6;?;Stanlake to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length close to off stump, punched to mid-off. There's that super-straight Azhar Ali bat again;
3.5;1;Stanlake to Sharjeel, 1 run on the legs again, a bit shorter, this time he's managed to tuck it down to long leg;
3.4;?;Stanlake to Sharjeel, no run oh man. Sharjeel defies the cliche of the subcontinental batsman who loves the ball on his pads. Misses another flick, and the ball hits his pad. Pitching well outside leg, of course;
3.3;?;Stanlake to Sharjeel, no run shortish, not quite short enough to pull. Plus he didn't move his feet at all. Front leg just went up in a prance, and the ball was through him before he could bring his bat across it. Hits him on the body;
3.3;1w;Stanlake to Sharjeel, 1 wide down the leg side again, Sharjeel misses another flick, but this one is wide enough to be called wide;
3.2;?;Stanlake to Sharjeel, no run back of a length on middle stump, defended off the back foot;
3.1;?;Stanlake to Sharjeel, no run back of a length, leg-sideish. Sharjeel fails to connect with a flick off the hip, ball hits his body. Wade dives to his right to stop the ball from rolling away for leg byes;
2.6;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length outside off, stabbed towards point;
2.5;4b;Starc to Azhar Ali, 4 byes whoa, what happened there? That was short outside off, and Azhar shaped to cut, and the ball just leapt off the pitch, kept rising and rising, beat his bat by a foot, and continued to defy gravity even as Wade leaped behind the stumps;
2.4;2;Starc to Azhar Ali, 2 runs this time he holds his shape a little longer, and is in the perfect position to play a checked drive, on the up, between short extra-cover and mid-off;
2.3;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run beaten. Good length outside off, continues on with the angle across rather than swinging back in. Azhar fails to connect with the on-the-up drive;
2.3;1w;Starc to Azhar Ali, 1 wide short ball, down the leg side, Azhar lifts his bat over his head and out of the way. Wade seems to cramp a little as he moves to his left to collect;
2.2;2;Starc to Azhar Ali, 2 runs fullish, swings in a little towards off stump. Azhar slices his drive a little, between backward point and cover point;
2.1;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run nice length, slants across the batsman before shaping back in towards off stump. Azhar shows the full face and punches to mid-on;
1.6;1;Stanlake to Azhar Ali, 1 run short, not as much width as those cuttable balls. Azhar waits on it and steers it to third man with a little wave of the wrists at the top of the bounce;
1.5;?;Stanlake to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on, lets it swing and dabs to backward point;
1.4;?;Stanlake to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length outside off, left alone. Again a bit of outswing;
1.3;?;Stanlake to Azhar Ali, no run short and wide again, cut straight to backward point;
1.2;?;Stanlake to Azhar Ali, no run short and wide, Azhar misses out, doesn't go hard at the cut and fails to connect anyway;
1.1;?;Stanlake to Azhar Ali, no run starts with a good ball, fourth-stump line, good length, away swing. Azhar leaves. He's a tall man with what seems a very side-on, slingy, Shoaib-esque release, without the humongous run-up and the wild hair and the crazy pace. A bit of a pause in his jump as well. So not really like Shoaib.;
0.6;?;Starc to Sharjeel, no run full, slanting down leg, doesn't bend back enough towards the stumps for Starc to make a confident lbw appeal as Sharjeel misses his flick;
0.5;?;Starc to Sharjeel, no run drifts onto the pads, clipped to short fine leg;
0.4;1;Starc to Azhar Ali, 1 run ooh, this one is fuller, threatens to swing in towards off stump but doesn't quite do as much as Azhar expects. Looks to drive through mid-off, gets a thick edge down to third man;
0.3;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run length ball, goes wider outside off this time, no swing this time. Azhar leaves it alone;
0.2;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run full, a bit of swing in from outside off. Azhar drives crisply but straight to short extra-cover;
0.1;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run back of a length outside off, left alone;

5.35pm We're all set to resume, at least according to the timings on this website... A minute later Yup, here we go. Mitchell Starc has the first new ball. Azhar and Sharjeel to open for Pakistan.
