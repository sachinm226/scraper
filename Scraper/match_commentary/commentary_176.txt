That will be lunch. Australia will be very satisfied with that session, taking six wickets, but England have got themselves to 300. Should have been more, but it's something to work with. They will rue the fifties not being converted. Lyon was again outstanding and got his reward for some lovely bowling. For some lunchtime reading, here's Jarrod Kimber's feature on Australia's desire for pace. We'll be back at 12.50pm for the second session.

89.1;?;Lyon to Ali, no run right on the money straight away, round the wicket, straightening off the deck, defended;

84.5;?;Starc to Ali, no run short, Moeen swings into a languid pull, and is through the stroke before it reaches him. Not having everything his own way in the last couple of overs;
84.4;?;Starc to Ali, no run push-driven into the covers. Starc aiming very full and at the base of the stumps;
84.3;2;Starc to Ali, 2 runs lose full toss, Moeen eases it into the leg side;
84.2;?;Starc to Ali, no run pokey and loose from Moeen! This one sticks in the pitch outside off, and Moeen has a dart, the ball scoots in the air into the off side, just short of short cover ... close!;
84.1;?;Starc to Ali, no run banged in short, Moeen ducks;
83.6;1;Hazlewood to Ali, 1 run squirted into the leg side;
83.5;?;Hazlewood to Ali, no run outside off, that's a nice area, making Moeen think about whether to play or leave. He elects for the latter;
83.4;?;Hazlewood to Ali, no run seeking the back-foot cover drive, but holding his intent in check. Tapped to cover;
83.3;?;Hazlewood to Ali, no run up on the toes, defending on the back foot under the eyeline;
83.2;?;Hazlewood to Ali, no run back of a length, nibbling off the pitch a bit like an offcutter. Moeen waits on his shot and deflects with soft hands to gully;

82.2;4;Starc to Malan, FOUR runs clobbered! Floated up outside off stump, Malan planted his front peg and wafted his cover drive clean through the line. Huge intent already from this pair;
82.1;?;Starc to Malan, no run leaning into the drive, punched to cover;
81.6;?;Hazlewood to Ali, no run left alone this time. Circumspection to the fore;
81.5;4;Hazlewood to Ali, FOUR runs crikey, that looked for all money as though Moeen had dollied a loose drive to mid-off, but he's tonked it up and over, a couple of bounces into the rope! Well, why not... if it's up there...!;
81.4;?;Hazlewood to Ali, no run back of a length, a bit too short to threaten the edge. Moeen just hangs on the back foot and waits for the ball to hit the middle of his bat;

80.4;?;Starc to Malan, no run leg-sided to start his day's work, but rising into a back-foot defence on the pads;
80.3;?;Starc to Malan, no run huge appeal for lbw! And Smith calls the review again. This was very full. Unless he's hit it...he hasn't hit it, but it's actually sliding past leg stump. Not even clipping, so that's a review lost;
80.2;?;Starc to Malan, no run back of a length, straightens a touch on Malan who adjusts late to play to cover;
80.1;?;Starc to Malan, no run good start, full at off stump, defended...85mph;

79.5;?;Lyon to Ali, no run can leave this one alone as it spins again;
79.4;?;Lyon to Ali, no run another ripper! How good has Lyon been today? So close to an edge, again, as this spins from around middle stump and defeats Moeen as he plays forward;

78.3;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run short of a length, bit of lift through to the keeper;

77.6;?;Lyon to Ali, no run dragged down short outside off, this time Moeen makes contact but doesn't get any timing or placement as he finds cover;
77.5;?;Lyon to Ali, no run full at middle, leans well forward;
77.4;?;Lyon to Ali, no run defended to the off side;
77.3;?;Lyon to Ali, no run jeepers! Moeen misses his cut at a shorter ball, so close to getting a bottom edge. Smith thought there was one. The ball was there for the stroke;
77.2;?;Lyon to Ali, no run plays forward with his bat in front of pad, defends wide of gully;
77.1;?;Lyon to Ali, no run left alone outside off;
76.6;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run huge shout for lbw, but this time Smith declines the review...Malan working to the leg side, might have pitched outside leg or was there bat? Pitched outside leg;

74.5;?;Cummins to Malan, no run switches to over the wicket, full at off stump, defended;
74.4;4;Cummins to Malan, FOUR runs and now he goes through the leg side! Whippage, fetches it from full outside off and sends it wide of mid-on with plenty of bottom hand;

70.4;W;Cummins to Root, OUT massive moment! Huge appeal for lbw, given not out by Erasmus, and Smith has called the review. Root falling across a full delivery, trying to play it too square, the bat got caught behind his pad. This looks very good. Smashing middle!;Joe Root lbw b Cummins 15 (79m 50b 1x4 0x6) SR: 30;
70.3;?;Cummins to Root, no run this is taken on the rise by Paine as Root lets it go through...perhaps a touch more pace in the surface now?;

J32: "I've just woken up. Has Stoneman crumbled under the Aussies pace? And how about Vince?" No. Was out to a very good ball. Vince played superbly before a badly-judged run
 Innings Start
4.04pm Take a bow, Steven Smith. What a masterful performance he has just compiled. Endless reserves of concentration, plus the ability to step up through the gears when the onus was on marshalling the tail. That is just an incredible effort, and it has secured Australia a lead of 26. Gnasher will be back in five for the resumption.
130.3;W;Root to Lyon, OUT tucked off the face of the bat, and that is pocketed at leg slip! Just trying to work it around the corner and couldn't keep it down. Neat catch;Nathan Lyon c Cook b Root 9 (37m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40.9;

125.6;?;Woakes to Smith, no run Smith premeditates a move across his stumps, so Woakes fires it down the leg side. Cunning. A dot. Lyon will be on strike;
