1.50pm: The clouds have reappeared at the end of the innings. Ground staff are ready. Not a bad comeback by West Indies but Australia should be pleased with this. It's going to challenge the hosts. If Duckworth-Lewis comes into play, chasing could be more of a challenge. But West Indies are high on confidence. Russell's four wickets and dynamic fielding should be inspiring enough.
Alan will take you through the first 15 overs. Join us in 40 minutes.

 Innings Start
6.20pm: Before you go and pour that drink to steady your frayed nerves, it's time for the presentations ...
Darren Sammy is named Man of the Match: "As a team we decided to bowl first. We weren't at our best, at one time it looked like we would be chasing 330 but we pulled it back. Against the world No. 1, with our backs against the wall, it was fantastic effort from the team. Today again the top order didn't click but we can still put runs on the board. It's about getting the top six to click. We have a 'never say die' attitude, everyone played their part, as a captain I was well supported and it's good to see us getting results ... I think we should have won the series, looking back at that third game. The Lord works in mysterious ways. I just want to thank the crowds for coming out and supporting us."
Australia captain Shane Watson: "It was good for us in the end, to close off the game, even though a fantastic innings from Darren Sammy ran us close. We hoped to get up around 300 but thought we done enough. Brett Lee is a high-class one-day bowler and that showed for us today ... We are in a bit of a transition phase, it's been a pleasing series, there are a few things we have to work on but we're going the right way."
Kieron Pollard is named Man of the Series: "Obviously I'm pleased but I think we should have won the series. Both teams played well but I think we have won back some of the hearts of the people of the West Indies. I've worked hard and hopefully one day I'll play a Test match against these guys as well."
That, folks, is a wrap. Cheers for your comments, we'll be back for more of the same for the first of two T20 internationals on Tuesday.
6.10pm: Victory by 30 runs means Australia level the series at 2-2. Sammy resurrected his side with a scintillating knock but the deficiencies at the top of the order meant his efforts were in vain. Two questions spring immediately to mind, though: why did Sammy not come in higher up the order (above Baugh, for instance); and why did he choose to bowl in the first place?
Minor quibbles aside, it's been a terrific series, closely fought (all but one match went down to the final few overs) and with some cracking individual contributions. Australia have underwhelmed slightly but salvaged some pride at the end; their 17-year unbeaten record in ODI series against West Indies remains intact. In the performances of Kieron Pollard, Sunil Narine and Sammy, West Indies fans have reasons to be cheerful.
47.2;W;Hilfenhaus to Sammy, OUT full, heaved away into the leg side once again ... but this time he finds a fielder. Sammy perishes in the deep and West Indies suffer heroic defeat! He swung hard but this time without quite the same venom, looping a high catch to Mike Hussey at deep square leg. A valiant innings from the captain but his side fall short;Daren Sammy c MEK Hussey b Hilfenhaus 84 (79m 50b 6x4 6x6) SR: 168;

40.6;W;Doherty to Russell, OUT forward press on the stumps, Australia appeal for lbw - they're going to review it. The question is whether it was bat or pad first ... the side camera angle suggests pad, and the ball was going on to hit ... Russell is gone and Doherty has claimed a potentially crucial wicket! Russell goes for a rapid 41, ending a century stand that brought West Indies back from the dead. Surely that's the final blow, though ...?;Andre Russell lbw b Doherty 41 (58m 33b 6x4 0x6) SR: 124.24;

2.20pm: Hello, cricketeers. West Indies need 281 to seal the series 3-1 against Australia - not quite the highest run chase at the Beausejour stadium, but still a stiff target and one that was beyond Australia in the fourth match. Still, if the weather gets seriously funky, a no-result will also see West Indies win the series. As that hasn't happened against Australia for 17 years, they'll take it however it comes.
