Data
Good resistance from Haddin but that's a fine, fine effort from England's bowlers. Ideal start to the second Test for the tourists after being asked to field first. Anderson was the pick, finishing with 4 for 51, but the attack hunted in a pack and hassled the Australian line-up into submission. As history suggests, Adelaide is not a 245 all out ground and England have a huge chance to put themselves in charge but Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook will have a tricky two overs to see out before the close tonight. Have to mention Michael Hussey, who was firmly back in his 2006 vintage again today and played everyone, Swann especially beautifully before edging a ripper behind for 93.
85.5;W;Broad to Haddin, OUT All over now! Broad finally gets a deserved wicket as he digs in a short ball that Haddin top-edges it sails high down to Finn on the fine leg boundary who makes no mistake;Brad Haddin c Finn b Broad 56 (148m 95b 3x4 1x6) SR: 58.94;
85.4;?;Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin backs away looking for something expansive, Broad doesn't blink and it ends up dribbling away into the off side off a toe-end;
85.3;2;Broad to Haddin, 2 runs ah lovely cricket from Haddin, leg-stump delivery he picks off into a gap between long-on and deep midwicket for a couple;
85.2;?;Broad to Haddin, no run Bollinger wants a single, of course he does, Haddin doesn't though as it's pushed gently to long-on;
85.1;?;Broad to Haddin, no run "no, no, no" is the call from Haddin as this is clipped to one of the boundary riders;
84.6;?;Anderson to Bollinger, no run slightly slower, Anderson concentrating on length and line, finds a squeezed inside-edge from Bollinger;
84.5;?;Anderson to Bollinger, no run big appeal from the bowler but it was probably swinging past leg and going over. Not a lot going for it really;
84.4;?;Anderson to Bollinger, no run ooh, good ball, full and straight, swinging in a touch, Bollinger was solid on the jabbed defence;
84.3;W;Anderson to Siddle, OUT this time he's gone! Haddin's gamble doesn't come off as this is again clipped off the legs uppishly, but this time reaching Cook who pouches the chance to give Anderson his fourth;Peter Siddle c Cook b Anderson 3 (24m 21b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;
84.2;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run worked off the pads a touch uppishly to square leg but no real alarm;
84.1;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run just a single taken this time and Haddin is happy for Siddle to face, pushed down to long-on for a jogged single, suspect Anderson won't mind that;
83.6;?;Broad to Siddle, no run excellent batting from Siddle, clear about what he has to do, which is hang around, and leaves well alone to set up another Haddin v Anderson battle;
83.5;?;Broad to Siddle, no run Broad aiming for the top of off and Siddle is more than up for the challenge;
83.4;?;Broad to Siddle, no run resounding clunk as Siddle defends very confidently off the front foot;
83.3;?;Broad to Siddle, no run Broad reverts to a length but finds a very sensible defensive prod from Siddle;
83.2;?;Broad to Siddle, no run too short to interest Siddle, who pops under it;
83.1;?;Broad to Siddle, no run Broad finds a full and straight length to Siddle who defends, without looking all that sure;
82.6;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run full, yorker length and swinging away. The ball dips under the bat, and Anderson ambles down to have a quick word with Haddin. Congratulating him on a good innings, perhaps;
82.5;6;Anderson to Haddin, SIX runs scooped over fine leg for six! What a shot. He backed to leg again, this time Anderson followed him with a full inswinger that looked to be heading down the leg side ... but Haddin somehow connected with it, and well! And that's his fifty;
82.4;2;Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs short, hooked off his nose down to fine leg where Trott charges round and completes a good, sliding stop;
82.3;2;Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs clipped behind square on the leg side, the man is slow coming in off the fence and they're back for the second, much to Prior's annoyance;
82.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run he's worn one, and that will have hurt! Haddin backed to leg again, but this time Anderson followed him with the short ball. It hit him on the wrist and then the chest. If it did hurt, he's not showing it;
82.1;2;Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs ... who steps to leg and chips up and over cover for a couple. Big gap there, and they get two;
81.6;?;Broad to Siddle, no run and again the ball hoops past the edge! Top quality swing bowling here, that was right up to the batsman and swinging away appreciably;
81.5;?;Broad to Siddle, no run beaten on the drive! It was full and, in Siddle's eyes, drivable. But the movement away took it past the outside edge;
81.4;2;Broad to Siddle, 2 runs runs for Siddle, he gets on top of the bounce and angles the ball down between the second and third slips for a couple. Intentionally played, and dropping well short of the fielders;
81.3;?;Broad to Siddle, no run too wide to get Siddle playing, left alone;
81.2;1;Broad to Haddin, 1 run slanting into the pads this time, and Haddin puts him away to deep square leg for one;
81.1;?;Broad to Haddin, no run full, and Broad too finds some away shape straight away. Haddin steps forward and attempts a square drive but finds Pietersen at point;
80.6;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run this is slightly too wide of off and moving further away, Siddle plays well inside the line;
80.5;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run and again! This time Siddle whipped the bat inside the line, but only after the ball had burst past the outside edge;
80.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run that's drawn him into the stroke! Landing on middle and off, jagging away, and Siddle's not good enough to get a touch on that. Close to unplayable;
80.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run swinging towards the slips once again, but it moves early and Siddle is able to leave alone quite safely;
80.2;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run pitching on a length on middle, swinging towards off, but Siddle defends;
80.1;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run and there's movement straight away! Some curve through the air and real movement off the seam away from the bat, and Siddle doesn't even get close to it;
79.6;1;Swann to Siddle, 1 run very full on the toes, Siddle clips to leg amid howls of "catch it!" from England's close fielders, but that's safe;
79.5;?;Swann to Siddle, no run flighted outside off, defended once again;
79.4;?;Swann to Siddle, no run Siddle stretches out to defend his first ball;
79.3;W;Swann to Haddin, OUT Doherty, ball-watching, is run out! Haddin stepped across to the off side, nudging into the leg side for what should have been a single. It was always going to be tight, but he could've got home if he'd set off straight away. Haddin called for it as soon as he hit it, but Doherty wasn't sure and lingered at the non-striker's end. He'd played pretty well until that point, that's a shame;Xavier Doherty run out (Strauss/Cook/?Prior) 6 (25m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 31.57;
79.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run again Australia's keeper is forward, defending towards mid-on;
79.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin leans forward to defend;
78.6;?;Finn to Doherty, no run aimed at the top of off, but it's met with watchful defence as Doherty survives another over;
78.5;?;Finn to Doherty, no run tucked to mid-on's right, the fielder sprints round to cut off the single;
78.4;?;Finn to Doherty, no run this one moves in off the seam and also appears to keep just a touch low, but Doherty is watching it closely and gets the bat down to defend in good time;
78.3;?;Finn to Doherty, no run fuller, wider, but Doherty won't be tempted;
78.2;?;Finn to Doherty, no run round the wicket comes Finn, hurling it down on a length to have Doherty defending from the crease;
78.1;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run pitched up outside off, Haddin drives out to deep extra cover;
77.6;?;Swann to Doherty, no run Swann comes round the wicket and tosses one up outside off, Doherty gets right forward but then whips his bat out of the way to leave;
77.5;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run turn and bounce! The ball spits off a length, taking the shoulder of the bat and running down to fine leg;
77.4;?;Swann to Haddin, no run full outside off, this time Haddin gets forward to defend;
77.3;?;Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin bends down into another slog sweep, again he fails to connect and this time he's hit on the pad. That looked to be hitting him outside the line, but England have asked for a review ... Yep, he's hit marginally outside the line, so that's not out. And England have no more reviews to play with;
77.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin plays back, tapping it back to the bowler;
77.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run slow through the air from Swann, Haddin backs to leg and tries to run it down to third man. An athletic stop and return from Collingwood makes sure that doesn't happen;
76.6;?;Finn to Doherty, no run very short on middle, Doherty is not a tall man and gets underneath it quite easily;
76.5;4;Finn to Doherty, FOUR runs full and wide once again, this time Doherty latches onto it with a flashing square drive. Not a bad shot for a No. 9!;
76.4;?;Finn to Doherty, no run pushed wider of off this time, Doherty leaves;
76.3;?;Finn to Doherty, no run Finn comes round the wicket and strikes Doherty on the front pad to spark an emotive appeal... but that looked to be slipping down leg, even on the first viewing, and they don't even bother to review as the Umpire says "not out";
76.2;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run chopped down to third man, that'll just be one;
76.1;4;Finn to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin's muscular forearms send the ball arcing over mid-on! Nothing but a firm punch, he checked the shot but lofted it in the air and well over the man at mid-on. Great shot, sweet timing;
75.6;?;Swann to Doherty, no run very full on off stump, dug out to mid-off;
75.5;?;Swann to Doherty, no run quicker ball, speared in at off stump, but Doherty is solid in defence;
75.4;2;Swann to Doherty, 2 runs drift and turn again for Swann! He comes round the wicket and finds the outer half of Doherty's bat, but the batsman was well forward and played with soft hands to pick up two to short third man;
75.3;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run this time he's forward and right across to the off side, the ball squirts past the man at short leg and the sprint through for one;
75.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run again Haddin opts to play from the crease, defending back down the track;
75.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run fizzing down on a length outside off, this one goes straight on as Haddin defends;
74.6;?;Finn to Doherty, no run this time Doherty steps forward and across to drive, but the ball goes straight to extra cover;
74.5;?;Finn to Doherty, no run on a length and straight this time, Doherty is slightly late getting the bat down in defence and is struck on the thigh;
74.4;?;Finn to Doherty, no run closer to the off stump this time, but not close enough to get Doherty to play a shot;
74.3;?;Finn to Doherty, no run pushed wide of off on a length, Doherty has a look and lets it go;
74.2;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run back of a length, pushed out in front of a diving Pietersen at point and they take the single;
74.1;4;Finn to Haddin, FOUR runs right, Haddin's decided he's got to open up now, and he steps away to leg to slash this through the off side. He doesn't quite get all of it, but a thick edge flies down to third man;
73.6;?;Swann to Doherty, no run and slightly more certain defence from Doherty to finish the over;
73.5;?;Swann to Doherty, no run nervous defence from Doherty for the hat-trick ball! Slip, short gully, silly mid-off and short leg were all in;
73.4;W;Swann to Harris, OUT Huge appeal for lbw, Harris is totally done in the flight and the ball thumps into the back pad. He wasn't too far forward, the umpire raises the finger but Harris asks for the review. Has he hit that? Is it missing leg? Nope, he's given out!;Ryan Harris lbw b Swann 0 (4m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
73.3;W;Swann to Hussey, OUT he's gone! Hussey is gone in the 90s, and Swann has finally spun one appreciably! Hussey was forward and across, leaning into a drive, and the ball took a thick edge to land in Collingwood's lap at slip;Michael Hussey c Collingwood b Swann 93 (299m 183b 8x4 0x6) SR: 50.81;
73.2;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run tossed up slightly fuller, Haddin flicks down to long-on to get Hussey back on strike;
73.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run quick through the air from Swann, Haddin presents the full face in defence;
72.6;?;Finn to Hussey, no run Finn comes round the wicket, spearing the ball down at the off stump to have Hussey pressing forward in careful defence;
72.5;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run this one holds its line, and Haddin nurdles off his left leg for one to bring up the 50 stand;
72.4;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run short and quick from Finn, hurrying Hussey's hook out to the man on the fence at deep square;
72.3;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run fuller this time, right on off stump and Haddin taps through cover for one;
72.2;?;Finn to Haddin, no run and again! Finn is reversing it here. He's holding it like an inswinger but it's snaking away late through the air, and Haddin's outside edge is beaten with consecutive deliveries;
72.1;?;Finn to Haddin, no run what did that hit? It's an old ball but Finn's found some life in it yet, getting this one to nip away and beat the outside edge of a stodgy prod from Haddin;
71.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey leaps onto the front foot and opens the face of the bat, guiding the ball to backward point;
71.5;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run and he rotates the strike with a little nudge behind square on the leg side;
71.4;?;Swann to Haddin, no run more defence from Haddin;
71.3;?;Swann to Haddin, no run pushed defensively into the leg side;
71.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run that's more like it, he opts for defence this time;
71.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run huge swipe! First ball, Haddin goes for a slog sweep and, luckily for him, the ball doesn't turn in, scooting just past the off stump;
70.6;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run good delivery here from Finn, quicker and yorker length, doesn't quite squeeze through as Haddin clamps down in time for a single;
70.5;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run tap and run from Hussey, doesn't he do that well;
70.4;3;Finn to Haddin, 3 runs ah, the wonders of soft hands, nicely played, runs off the face down towards third man, some lung-busting running earns three;
70.3;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin, who is the most Australian looking man you ever see, defends studiously on the back foot;
70.2;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run picked off to deep midwicket with a flick of the wrists;
70.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run more line and length stuff from Finn, which is no bad thing, Hussey defends. Cripes Hussey is in the 90s now, almost by stealth, just been so busy and bustling;
69.6;?;Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin works this into the leg side to end Swann's comeback over;
69.5;?;Swann to Haddin, no run slightly quicker this time and Haddin hurries in defence;
69.4;2;Swann to Haddin, 2 runs that's the reward for patience, a touch of width, a touch short and a very delicate late cut past slip for a couple;
69.3;?;Swann to Haddin, no run neat and careful defence from Haddin who has been monastic with his patience today;
69.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run quietly prodded into the off side;
69.1;3;Swann to Hussey, 3 runs ah Hussey again down the track and flicking superbly to deep midwicket where KP makes a hash of a slide and stop, doesn't cost anything but Swann is not impressed;
68.6;?;Finn to Haddin, no run strange shot this, aimless dab outside off stump, kept a bit low and it ghosted past the edge, on replay that really was a poor shot;
68.5;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Finn has been feeding Haddin's drive with men set for the shot at short cover, this is played all along the ground though;
68.4;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Finn has been fairly decent this spell, sticking to an off-stump line;
68.3;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin times a full-faced drive nicely, but straight to mid-off;
68.2;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run Finn loses his line a fraction, but it's a game of fractions I'm told, and Hussey works this to leg for a single;
68.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run Finn goes full and finds the inside-half of the bat as Hussey drives, goes back to the bowler who fields with one hand;
67.6;?;Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin defends quietly to end the over. Excitingly Pietersen is ready to renter the field so whatever his ankle issue was must have cleared up;
67.5;?;Broad to Haddin, no run "yes Moggy boy!" says one of the England fielders as Morgan, on for KP, feilds at cover. Too many energy drinks methinks,;
67.4;1;Broad to Hussey, 1 run this one is wide enough to cut and Hussey does so well enough to pick up a single to deep point;
67.3;?;Broad to Hussey, no run this is a proper false-shot, Hussey bottom-edged a cut that was too close to him to play, bounces away harmlessly;
67.2;?;Broad to Hussey, no run hint of a false shot here as Hussey defends with the inside-half of the bat. Told you it was just a hint;
67.1;?;Broad to Hussey, no run Broad finds a good line from his around-the-wicket approach, he also finds Hussey's solid defence;
66.6;?;Finn to Haddin, no run very sure defence to end a decent comeback over from Finn;
66.5;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin has lots of time to play, which is the sort of thing wise sages of the game like to see in a batsman;
66.4;1lb;Finn to Hussey, 1 leg bye Finn errs in line, drifting on to the pads and Hussey picks off a single to punish him for it;
66.3;?;Finn to Hussey, no run everything was straight here, straight ball goes straight off the wicket straight into the middle of a very straight bat. Hussey and Finn are both very straight characters as well;
66.2;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run diving work from the salmon-like Bell at cover keeps this well-timed drive to a single, too full again from Finn, but better full than short;
66.1;?;Finn to Haddin, no run decent start to the new spell, back of a length, outside off, defended carefully;
65.6;1;Broad to Haddin, 1 run Haddin gets a short ball that he fiddles around the corner with the minimum of fuss and risk to keep the strike;
65.5;1;Broad to Hussey, 1 run just a fraction short and, even though it's well outside off, Hussey back and pulling in a flash, didn't time it though and it trickled wide of mid-on for a single;
65.4;?;Broad to Hussey, no run Broad from around the wicket floats up a speculative is-there-any-reverse length, and no, there isn't here as Hussey lets it go by outside off;
65.3;1;Broad to Haddin, 1 run Haddin drives crisply back at the bowler who does well to get a hand down on it and take the pace off, alas Pietersen at mid-off fluffs the follow-up work and allows the single;
65.2;?;Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin has his head firmly down in gritty defence, good to watch actually;
65.1;?;Broad to Haddin, no run huge appeal from Broad as this fuller ball nips back and traps Haddin on the pads, probably heading down but it kept a little low;
64.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run tidy over ends with sturdy defence from Hussey, good discipline from both men;
64.5;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run drive me pleads Anderson with a fuller length, okay says Hussey but straight to the fielder;
64.4;2;Anderson to Hussey, 2 runs good cricket, Anderson testing Hussey with one that was a fraction wider of off, Hussey uses the width to steer carefully past point for a couple;
64.3;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run less incident here, just solemn defence;
64.2;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run just a touch short and Hussey, being the wanton warrior he is, was on the pull in flash, sadly he was a touch too quick and bottom-edged straight into his unmentionables;
64.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run Anderson switches back to over the wicket but his line remains good, as does Hussey's defence;
63.6;?;Broad to Haddin, no run Broad has bowled very well for no reward today, bet he fancies a go with the second new ball when the time comes. He'll be hoping England have exposed Harris by then;
63.5;?;Broad to Haddin, no run once again Haddin can do nothing but defend, but does so with ease;
63.4;?;Broad to Haddin, no run miserly work from Broad, hugging off stump with his line, Haddin is resolute in defence;
63.3;?;Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin's sweet drive finds a man placed just for the shot at short extra cover;
63.2;?;Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin has been quite subdued, which is testament to the England bowlers;
63.1;?;Broad to Haddin, no run starts straight and forces defence from Haddin;
62.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run this comes back with the angle from around the wicket and tucks Hussey up in defence;
62.5;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run "bowling Jimmy" is the cry from the captain at slip as Hussey leaves alone outside off;
62.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run I can't remember the last time Hussey played a false shot, it's ridiculous, here he defends;
62.3;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run Haddin is again on the back foot, literally rather than metaphorically, nudging this with a hint of inside edge to square leg for one;
62.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run fuller this time but again more careful Haddin defence;
62.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run back of a length from Anderson, forces Haddin to play off the back foot but without any rush at all;
61.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey forward, lines this up perfectly and defends;
61.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run follows up the boundary with careful defence, as well he might;
61.4;4;Swann to Hussey, FOUR runs Hussey has troubled Swann all series and shapes to come down the wicket again, unsettles Swann enough to earn a full toss which he gleefully whips wide of midwicket for four;
61.3;3;Swann to Haddin, 3 runs lovely shot, Haddin has been waiting from Swann to err in length, this is just a touch short and he back-cuts very stylishly for three. Very stylish player Haddin;
61.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run quicker ball hurries Haddin into a defence;
61.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run tossed up a bit from Swann, Haddin casually pushes back to the bowler;
60.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run nicely done from Matt Prior tumbling to his right to ensure Anderson's wild leg-sided ball costs nothing;
60.5;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run close enough to draw a shot here, but it's nothing more or less than a defensive block;
60.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run similar line of attack, outside off stump, Hussey happy to let them go by at this stage;
60.3;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run this does offer to hold it's line from around the wicket, just a fraction too wide to make Hussey play;
60.2;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run a fraction fuller invites a drive that picks out cover;
60.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run this doesn't swing but does find a good line, Hussey defends and as crisply shouts "no!";
59.6;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run follows up the boundary with a well-taken single to keep the strike;
59.5;4;Swann to Hussey, FOUR runs wow, wonderful batting again, Hussey skips quickly down the track to make this into a half-volley and clips this with perfect timing and placement wide of midwicket for four;
59.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run After a delay Swann bowls and bowls well, drawing Hussey into an open-faced defensive prod;
59.3;3;Swann to Haddin, 3 runs powerfully struck, deserved four but the straight drive banged into Swann's toe, he's hobbling about now and for once not smiling. In fact, he looks in a bit of trouble;
59.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run careful defence from Haddin, taking his time here;
59.1;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run mid-off is set deep to Hussey, who again has played Swann sublimely, and he picks off a riskless single by pushing to that man;
58.6;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs hint on inswing from Anderson but only onto the middle of Haddin's blade as he sweetly times an on-drive wide of mid-on;
58.5;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run driven again firmly, securely but straight to the fielder;
58.4;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run Collingwood fields smartly at short extra and earns coos of loving approval from his team-mates;
58.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run the England fielders like this, they are an optimistic bunch though, Haddin pushed a little hard at the ball to short cover;
58.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin plays back to a ball that keeps a little bit low and defends to cover;
58.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run accurate start, it's amazing how accurate he has become actually, this is heading to the off stump before Haddin defends comfortably;
57.6;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run Haddin hasn't tried anything expansive as yet and works this off his pads around the corner for a single;
57.5;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run finally Hussey stays in his crease to play and does so well, pushing to mid-on and setting off straight away for a tight, but safe single;
57.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run driven crisply straight to short cover where Strauss fields and throws in a flash;
57.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey again running down the wicket, and running back again quickly as he pats straight to Swann who aims a throw;
57.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run turned more gently into the leg side;
57.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey starts as he's done all day, by chipping down the wicket and flicking to leg, where Broad fields smartly;
56.6;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin is so keen on leaving alone that he allows this to thud into his arm, strange end to the session;
56.5;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Finn invites an attacking stroke with a drive-me full ball, Haddin drives but carefully to mid-off;
56.4;?;Finn to Haddin, no run more careful defence from Haddin, he started like that in Brisbane and we all know where that went;
56.3;?;Finn to Haddin, no run perhaps if it wasn't 5 for 159 and if it wasn't the last over before tea Haddin would have had a dart at this outside off, as it is, he leaves alone;
56.2;?;Finn to Haddin, no run similar line, similar length but Haddin was a touch more rushed on the shot here, no alarm mind;
56.1;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Finn begins what could well be the last over before tea with a length ball around off stump that Haddin seems to have an age to play off the back foot;
55.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey skips up the wicket merrily and fiddles this towards midwicket;
55.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run;
55.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run;
55.3;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run slightly wider, chopped down through gully for one;
55.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run and again, still not much at all in the way of spin for Swann as Haddin defends off the back foot;
55.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin stays on the back foot, defending back down the track;
54.6;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run and Haddin is away, tapping just wide of mid-off for a scampered single;
54.5;?;Finn to Haddin, no run back of a length, Haddin hops across to defend;
54.5;1w;Finn to Haddin, 1 wide Haddin is immediately greeted by a brute of a bouncer, but buckles his knees in time to slip underneath it;
54.4;W;Finn to North, OUT Finn strikes! North is caught behind! What was he trying to do here? A shot of some sort was on, there was width on offer, but he pushed limply at it - barely moving his feet - to send a thin edge through to Prior;Marcus North c ?Prior b Finn 26 (100m 93b 4x4 0x6) SR: 27.95;
54.3;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run that's a tight run on 35-year-old legs! Hussey taps just to mid-off's left and sets off immediately for one. That could've been close, but he put the fielder under real pressure and he couldn't quite pick it up cleanly;
54.2;?;Finn to Hussey, no run pitching closer to the batsman this time, but wider of off and left alone;
54.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run back of a length, Hussey stands tall and punches to mid-off;
53.6;?;Swann to North, no run slightly short from Swann, North leans back but can't find the gap at point;
53.5;?;Swann to North, no run North props forward in defence;
53.4;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run Hussey jumps out to drive, was that a chance? He drove in the air, but dropping short and slightly wide of the man at a close extra cover;
53.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run nudged defensively to leg this time;
53.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run and more of the same, as the Barmy Army suddenly come to life;
53.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run solid defence from Mr. Cricket;
52.6;3;Finn to Hussey, 3 runs more runs! Through the leg side this time. Again just too full from Finn and Hussey threads the gap between mid-on and midwicket. Hard running - a real effort in this heat - fetches him three runs;
52.5;4;Finn to Hussey, FOUR runs ah, this time he finds the gap! Too full from Finn, and Hussey launches into a cracking drive. He finds the gap at cover point and the ball is over the rope in a flash;
52.4;?;Finn to Hussey, no run nicely timed off the back foot to cover, but again England's defensive ring in the covers is impossible to break through;
52.3;?;Finn to Hussey, no run fuller on off stump, Hussey leans forward and defends to cover;
52.2;?;Finn to Hussey, no run a bit more spice in this delivery, as Hussey hops back to defend;
52.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run loosener outside off, Hussey has a look and opts to play no stroke;
51.6;?;Swann to North, no run and a leave to finish the over - a maiden;
51.5;?;Swann to North, no run tossed up teasingly! But it's met with decent defence;
51.4;?;Swann to North, no run driven back elegantly towards Swann, who dives to his right and pulls off a great stop;
51.3;?;Swann to North, no run watchful defence this time;
51.2;?;Swann to North, no run he leans back once again, hoping to seize upon a touch of width. But the forcing shot goes straight to point;
51.1;?;Swann to North, no run North hangs back and defends back to the bowler;
50.6;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run full and driven once again, but they just can't find a crack in this offside field;
50.5;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run legcutter, slower through the air and Hussey is taken somewhat by surprise as it's quite short too. He wears that one on the chest as Collingwood belts out an appeal, not sure why;
50.4;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run Hussey, this time, leaves a wide delivery well alone;
50.3;1;PD Collingwood to North, 1 run North is forward in defence, the ball takes the inside half of the bat and rolls to midwicket. Hussey calls immediately for one, and they charge through;
50.2;?;PD Collingwood to North, no run Collingwood pulls the length back, but keeps the line wide of off, and North isn't interested in a shot;
50.1;?;PD Collingwood to North, no run nicely driven by North, stepping well forward, but straight to cover;
49.6;1;Swann to North, 1 run nudged through square leg, and that takes their partnership to fifty;
49.5;?;Swann to North, no run guileful flight! Swann's not turning them, but he's floated this one up wonderfully and beaten North in the flight ... his front pad is in the way though, half an appeal but that was always going down;
49.4;?;Swann to North, no run very full, almost a yorker, and North digs it out back to Swann;
49.3;?;Swann to North, no run much fuller, but again pushed defensively to that man;
49.2;?;Swann to North, no run North is back and across and defending to the man under the helmet at silly mid-off;
49.1;2;Swann to North, 2 runs tapped in front of square on the leg side this time, and they hurry back for two;
48.6;1;PD Collingwood to North, 1 run on the hip, nudged through backward square;
48.5;?;PD Collingwood to North, no run pushed very wide of off, and that's an easy one to let go;
48.4;?;PD Collingwood to North, no run driven straight back and crashing into the stumps at the non-striker's end. Did Collingwood get a touch on that? A muted appeal comes from someone in the covers, but he's not got a hand to that;
48.3;?;PD Collingwood to North, no run well, he's picked the right ones to leave so far - again North steps forward and shoulders arms. Not far from off stump though, and Collingwood has his hands on his head;
48.2;3;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 3 runs wide of off, Hussey thrusts the bat out and chops the ball down between the wide slip and backward point, collecting a couple as the ball rolls down to third man;
48.1;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run forced hard off the back foot, but straight to mid-off;
47.6;?;Swann to North, no run defended to cover, right under the eyes;
47.5;?;Swann to North, no run North steps back and pushes defensively down the track;
47.4;?;Swann to North, no run nudged defensively to leg this time;
47.3;?;Swann to North, no run straighter, this time it's met with solid defence;
47.2;?;Swann to North, no run Swann is certainly testing North's technique outside off, this one landing just wide enough for North to leave, but close enough to draw appreciative oohs and aahs from the close fielders;
47.1;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run Hussey punches a full ball just wide of mid-off, and they scamper through;
46.6;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run driven back past the bowler, mid-on runs round and gets a hand to it to keep them to one;
46.5;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run Collingwood pushes the angle slightly wider, and Hussey leaves alone;
46.4;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run full and driven hard into the covers, but there are men there and he can't find the gap;
46.3;2;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 2 runs was that an inside edge? It's come off the inner half of the bat, for sure, and rolled down to fine leg. Collingwood and Prior are of the opinion that was fairly close but it's actually well-played by Hussey;
46.2;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run on a length and straight, bunted back to the bowler;
46.1;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run looped up temptingly outside off, and Hussey takes the bait as he leans out to drive. Straight to cover though;
45.6;?;Swann to North, no run another leave from North, this one undeniably the safer of the two this over, wider of off and going further with the turn;
45.5;?;Swann to North, no run nudged to short midwicket;
45.4;?;Swann to North, no run punched defensively to cover, but no single on offer;
45.3;?;Swann to North, no run defended back to the bowler this time;
45.2;?;Swann to North, no run ooh, that's another very brave leave from North! Similar to the one he played to Swann before the drinks break, tossed up from round the wicket , North shoulders arms but it doesn't turn much and isn't far away from off stump;
45.1;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run Hussey's used his feet well to the spinner today, and continues to do so as he shimmies down and drives to deep mid-off;
44.6;4;Broad to North, FOUR runs gracefully clipped! It was another slower one from Broad, but it was pitched up on North's pads this time and was flicked with great balance to midwicket. Top shot;
44.5;?;Broad to North, no run on a length and wide of off, North lets it through without a stroke;
44.4;?;Broad to North, no run effort ball again from Broad, short and fast. This time he has North ducking out of the way;
44.3;?;Broad to North, no run slower - much slower, in fact - but North spots the change and waits on a defensive push;
44.2;?;Broad to North, no run Broad steams in from round the wicket and bangs it in halfway down with a grunt, North sways out of the way in a hurry;
44.1;?;Broad to North, no run full, and a softening Kookaburra is easily nudged to mid-on;
43.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run full, pitching on middle and leg and defended back down the track;
43.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey comes forward, angling the bat in defence to cover the turn;
43.4;1;Swann to North, 1 run width, slapped firmly to backward point, where Finn can't quite field cleanly and lets them through for one;
43.3;?;Swann to North, no run quicker through the air, the ball grips a touch but North's bat is jammed down in good time;
43.2;?;Swann to North, no run pitching on middle this time, not much turn on offer though and it's defended back down the track easily enough;
43.1;?;Swann to North, no run he comes round the wicket and lobs it up on middle and off, watchfully prodded into the off side;
42.6;?;Broad to Hussey, no run very good maiden over from Broad, ends with a fuller ball that Hussey pushes into the leg side;
42.5;?;Broad to Hussey, no run steered carefully to point, not quite enough width on offer to cut;
42.4;?;Broad to Hussey, no run very good stuff from Broad, doing all he can to make something happen, finds the inside-edge of Hussey's blade here as he's rushed on a defence;
42.3;?;Broad to Hussey, no run banged in a touch shorter, Hussey watches carefully and blocks;
42.2;?;Broad to Hussey, no run it might just be my eyes failing me at 3.40am, but it looked like there was a hint of swing there, certainly was a swing of the bat, but Hussey's firm drive found cover;
42.1;?;Broad to Hussey, no run Broad dishes up something juicy outside off, imploring Hussey to drive, which he duly does but only to cover;

Time for a drink and after the break it will be Mr Liam "Cremer would be devastating on this" Brickhill.
 Innings Start
And there it is, Strauss is up on the team balcony to wave them back in and England declare with a lead of 375. England's dominance has been clear in this innings.
Australia face a massive challenge here, on a pitch that is beginning to show signs of sharp turn. Watson was moving very gingerly in the field this morning, and Katich is very obviously in some distress and limping. Will he need a runner? With Clarke's dodgy back and almost the whole seam attack carrying minor niggles, Australia are walking wounded and will have to dig really deep. Ponting suggested on the third evening that this game would be a test of what Australia are really made of, and that it certainly will be.
Nath still has hope: "Any chance that the English bowlers will suffer from muscular atrophy and not even be able to lift a cricket ball, let alone bowl? They haven't had anything to do for a long time now."
Again, grovelling apologies for the technical issue that delayed our commentary today. I assure you we were doing everything we could to get back up to speed - Sahil is a sweaty, frazzled bundle of nerves after that horror start to our comms today. As am I. We both need a nice cup of tea.

151.4;1;Siddle to Bell, 1 run low full toss, punched to deep mid-off;
151.3;2;Siddle to Bell, 2 runs Bell skips down the track and Siddle responds by dragging it down short, a top-edged hoick falls safely in the vacant area near deep midwicket;

151.1;2;Siddle to Bell, 2 runs full and tailing in through the air outside off, Bell leans forward and slaps a drive out to the cover sweeper;

150.4;3;Doherty to Bell, 3 runs Bell gets down on one knee and dabs a fine sweep away for three more, runs flowing and Australia looking ragged;

148.3;2;Doherty to Prior, 2 runs oh no! Prior top-edges a sweep over square leg, Pointing running back after it, North running in for it, they both pull out at the last moment and it plops down between them;
148.2;1;Doherty to Bell, 1 run driven to long off with no fuss at all to bring up another serene Bell fifty;

147.3;?;Siddle to Prior, no run Prior aims something expansive, a smack to leg, but doesn't actually get much of it and it trickles away;
147.2;?;Siddle to Prior, no run Prior gets away with, he was given out lbw to a full ball that swung in late, and a long way, strikes him flush on the pad. Prior opted to review, more out of hope than anything else, and Hawk Eye showed it sliding past leg;

146.6;6;Doherty to Bell, SIX runs ah lovely shot here, none of the Pietersen muscle, just pure timing and class, down the track and lifted over mid-on for six;
146.5;?;Doherty to Bell, no run this spins wide off;
146.4;3;Doherty to Prior, 3 runs Prior is away, pushing into the covers and gets two because Watson is running painfully slow in pursuit;
146.3;?;Doherty to Prior, no run defends his first ball quietly into the off side;
146.2;W;Doherty to Pietersen, OUT all over! Pietersen falls to left-arm spin again. But not before he'd made 227. Doherty finally tosses up a really slow, widish one outside off, Pietersen aims another almighty heave but it spins away, comes off the toe-end and goes very gently to slip;Kevin Pietersen c Katich b Doherty 227 (428m 308b 33x4 1x6) SR: 73.7;
146.1;4;Doherty to Pietersen, FOUR runs tossed up a fraction around off stump, Pietersen stays in his crease and butchers it over midwicket for four, massive slog sweep brings up his career best;
145.6;1;Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run the over ends with Pietersen dropping a single into the off side, he runs straight down the middle of the pitch and earns a quiet word from the umpire;
145.5;1;Bollinger to Bell, 1 run;
145.4;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run;
145.3;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run driven firmly again, Pietersen set up in one-day mode but can't quite pierce the infield;

145.1;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run finally the first ball of the over is delivered and it is smashed to midwicket;
144.6;?;Siddle to Bell, no run dug in short and Bell is onto the shot in a flash, too quick in fact and is through it before the ball arrives and it bobbles away into the leg side;
144.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run this is slipped down the leg side, Bell aims a fiddle but doesn't connect;
144.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run Bell edges down the crease at Siddle but only to defend firmly to cover;
144.3;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run floated up on a drive length, Pietersen crashes into the shot but finds cover;

143.2;4;Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs goodness me, this was gentle from Bollinger and savage from Pietersen, floated up outside off and Pietersen stood still and scythed a drive through cover to the ropes;
143.1;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run Bollinger begins on a length and a good line outside off stump, if he could just have done that all day yesterday... Pietersen defends;
142.6;1;Doherty to Pietersen, 1 run eased out to deep cover for a single;

142.3;4;Doherty to Pietersen, FOUR runs dispatched straight back over the bowler's head, a clean strike right through the line. Doherty just turns and heads back to his mark;
142.2;1;Doherty to Bell, 1 run full, driven just wide of point and they take a quick single. Pietersen's hamstring is not totally shot, then;
142.1;2;Doherty to Bell, 2 runs premeditated paddle-sweep down to fine leg... Bollinger, understandably weary after completing the last over, is slightly slow to get to it at that position;
141.6;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run fuller outside off, Pietersen aims an exploratory drive at mid-off;
141.5;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run that's better, slung down outside off and Pietersen raises his bat to leave;

138.1;1;Doherty to Pietersen, 1 run driven just wide of mid-off, and there it is! Double-ton up for Pietersen, and that obviously means a lot to him. He roars a celebration and pumps his fist, down on one knee. The bat is raised to all corners of the ground;
137.6;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run full of length, pitching off, and defended firmly to mid-off;

135.3;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run length, tapped defensively back to the bowler;
135.2;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run that looked like a little offcutter. It certainly deviated off the pitch, but at no great pace and easily defended;

134.6;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run rising off a length outside off, Pietersen raises his bat out of harm's way as the ball passes him;
134.5;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run pushed defensively into the off side;

134.3;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run defended firmly into the leg side. Pietersen steps away from the crease after playing the shot and seems concerned about something on the end of his finger... Did he break a nail?;
134.2;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run Pietersen drops the ball towards cover and thinks about a quick single, but Harris sprints across to put such thoughts out of his mind;
134.1;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run a hint of away swing for Harris there, but it only really moved once it passed the batsman - who had left the ball well alone;
133.6;4;Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs languidly driven through cover! The footwork, timing and placement were all spot on, a real classy shot;
133.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run this one pitches and straightens slightly outside off, Bell is watching it closely as he raises his bat to leave;
133.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run Siddle goes straighter and draws a defensive stroke from Bell;
133.3;4;Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs a scything cut shot flies to the cover point boundary! Cracked in front of square, it was over the rope in a flash;
133.2;2;Siddle to Bell, 2 runs short on middle and off, Bell hooks off his nose out to long leg where Dougie Bollinger runs round and slides into a stop ... he didn't quite judge that one right, and ended up basically sitting on the ball. Still, at least he stopped it;
133.1;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run pushed out square on the leg side for one;
132.6;1;Harris to Pietersen, 1 run a thick inside edge rolls out through square leg;

132.4;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run nudged gently to mid-on this time;
132.3;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run Pietersen's bottom hand takes over as he whips very firmly but straight to the fielder at midwicket. He's visibly annoyed with himself for missing out on that scoring opportunity - it was a leg-stump half-volley really;
132.2;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run KP steps forward to defend to cover;
132.1;4;Harris to Pietersen, FOUR runs thick outside edge as Pietersen pushes flat-footed at a back of a length delivery outside off. Goes through the huge gap - there's just the one slip in - and down to third man. Wouldn't have carried to a slip, even if there had been one;
131.6;4;Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs all timing, balance and placement as Bell glances to the wide midwicket boundary. Mitchell Johnson, on as a substitute fielder, escorts the ball all the way to the rope and puts in a dive in vain;
131.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run full and tailing in slightly on off stump, Bell leans into an elegant textbook defence;
131.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run short and wide enough for the cut, but Bell doesn't quite get it right and chops down to backward point;
131.3;?;Siddle to Bell, no run Bell continues in a cautious vein after drinks, defending a length delivery on off stump;
131.2;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run full and nudged into the leg side to bring up England's 500. Pietersen sprints through for the single and grips the hamstring afterwards ... he gives it a good stretch, but seems to be OK;
131.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run Siddle charges in and hurls it down on a length. The extra effort helps the ball kick up off the turf, and Pietersen is slightly taken aback by the extra bounce;
130.6;?;Harris to Bell, no run more defence from Bell, played right under the eyes and out towards cover point;
130.5;?;Harris to Bell, no run Bell shuffles into a light-footed but firm defence;
130.4;1;Harris to Pietersen, 1 run short, and Pietersen cracks a pull out into the deep. It wasn't quite the bouncer, and didn't get above midriff height;
130.3;4lb;Harris to Pietersen, 4 leg byes down leg again, this time the ball hits the thigh pad and flies down to fine leg;
130.2;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run half an appeal from Harris as Pietersen is struck on the pad looking to clip to leg. But it's quickly stifled, definitely going down;
130.1;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run full, driven back hard at the bowler who sticks out a right hand to cut it off;
129.6;?;Siddle to Bell, no run lucky for Bell here as he's too quick on an attempted pull and bottom-edges onto his leg;
129.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run Bell eases a fluid drive to Clarke who is very deep at mid-off but it's timed too well to pick up a single;
129.4;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run full and straight and the sliced drive goes uppishly through a second gully region for a walked single;
129.3;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run there's a touch of movement here, and bounce too, starts too wide of off to draw a shot but something for the bowlers to smile about;
129.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run left all alone outside off stump, Pietersen 16 away from an Ashes double-hundred and not wanting to give it away;
129.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run Siddle finds a tidy length and line around off stump but Pietersen is completely untroubled in defence;
128.6;?;Harris to Bell, no run outside off again, this time the bounce is fine but Bell leaves alone anyway;
128.5;?;Harris to Bell, no run interesting, this keeps very low, pitching outside off and burrowing through to Haddin under Bell's bat;

128.3;1;Harris to Pietersen, 1 run this time Pietersen stands tall and punches to deep cover for one;
128.2;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run beaten outside off! Lovely delivery, just offered to hold its line and it nipped past Pietersen's outside edge;
128.1;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run good start to the new spell, precious little off the track but the line is good, the length is good and Pietersen has to defend;
127.6;?;Siddle to Bell, no run a touch fuller and invites a drive that Bell pats to cover;
127.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run closer to off stump this time but Bell happy again to leave alone;
127.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run Siddle settles into a good length and line around off stump, Bell thinks about playing before thinking again at the last moment;
127.3;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run similar line to the last delivery but Pietersen can't resist a dart at it and slices past point for a single;
127.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run back of a length outside off stump, Pietersen leaves alone with a flourish;
127.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run Siddle hurries Pietersen in defence here;

126.5;2;North to Bell, 2 runs quicker ball goes on with the arm and finds something approaching an outside edge that runs past the slips for a couple;
126.4;?;North to Bell, no run nudged into the leg side, just short of Hussey at short leg;
126.3;?;North to Bell, no run tossed up from North, Bell clips back to the bowler who flings it back to Haddin;
126.2;2;North to Bell, 2 runs another stylish drive from Bell, easing it past cover for a couple;
126.1;1;North to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen collects a riskless single pushed to long-on;
125.6;?;Siddle to Bell, no run good length, good line and careful defence from Bell;
125.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run better length and line from Siddle outside off stump and Bell leaves alone;
125.4;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run single taken this time, Pietersen defending on the walk to pick up one down the ground;
125.3;4;Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs oh dear, juicy leg-stump half-volley, Pietersen in any form would knock these away and in form like this there was no doubt, crashing it very firmly all along the ground past midwicket;
125.2;4;Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs too full from Siddle and Pietersen steps and crunches into a drive down the ground for four;
125.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run Pietersen strolls into a defensive push back to the bowler;
124.6;?;North to Bell, no run Bell stretches forward to defend;
124.5;4;North to Bell, FOUR runs ah lovely shot, classical back-cut timed ideally fine of point for four;
124.4;?;North to Bell, no run North drops just a fraction short and Bell is back and flicking to leg in a flash but Hussey at midwicket makes a good stop;
124.3;1;North to Pietersen, 1 run no alarm for Pietersen here, clipping down to long-on;
124.2;?;North to Pietersen, no run turn and bounce down the leg side and neatly taken by Haddin, always good to see leg-side takes;
124.1;?;North to Pietersen, no run beaten, sneaks past the outside edge as this pitches and goes on with the arm. Nicely bowled;
123.6;1;Watson to Pietersen, 1 run bit of a heave here from Pietersen, lost his shape on the shot and it skewed off the inside edge down to deep square;
123.5;3;Watson to Bell, 3 runs very full from Watson and flicked fine by Bell, looks like it's heading for four until big Doug tumbles to save by the rope;
123.4;1;Watson to Pietersen, 1 run ooh, Pietersen has one of his Red Bull moments, pushing straight to the fielder and heading off for a needlessly tight single, he's very swift between the sticks though;
123.3;2;Watson to Pietersen, 2 runs clipped very cleanly wide of midwicket for a well-run couple;

121.6;?;Watson to Bell, no run this is outside off stump and Bell leaves alone;
121.5;1;Watson to Pietersen, 1 run this time Pietersen's drive is solid and it runs to the boundary rider on the off side;
121.4;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run ooh, close here, Watson is finding just enough indrift to cause trouble, it sneaks back finds an inside edge on to the pad and loops just short of short third man;
121.3;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run driven firmly and straight back to the bowler;
121.2;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run wide of off again from Watson, Pietersen happy to slash a drive again but this time finds a fielder;
121.1;4;Watson to Pietersen, FOUR runs slashed and slashed hard, hint of away movement meant it found something near the edge and flew past point to the boundary;
120.6;?;North to Bell, no run Bell heading down the wicket again, didn't get there and it spun back into him sharply;
120.5;1;North to Pietersen, 1 run eased down to long-off for a jogged single;

120.2;?;North to Pietersen, no run this is blocked more securely;
120.1;?;North to Pietersen, no run ooh, Swann will like this, sharp turn and bounce out of the footholes, troubles Pietersen as he defends;
119.6;?;Watson to Bell, no run another maiden for Watson as Bell picks out point with a square drive;
119.5;?;Watson to Bell, no run well, if only runs were awarded for style, Bell would be on plenty all ready, sadly for him his crisp drive has found a fielder again;
119.4;?;Watson to Bell, no run studious forward defence;
119.3;?;Watson to Bell, no run big cry of "aaaaw" from the crowd as this spins back from Bell's forward block and runs past the stumps, not overly close mind;
119.2;?;Watson to Bell, no run good length and line from Watson, heading for the top of off, Bell defends;
119.1;?;Watson to Bell, no run there is a hint of movement into the right hander which finds the inside edge;
118.6;?;North to Pietersen, no run Pietersen knocks this into the leg side to finish the over. Be interesting to see if he tries to match Bell shot for shot;
118.5;1;North to Bell, 1 run Bell's quick-footed drive finds mid-off but he scampers through for a single;
118.4;4;North to Bell, FOUR runs Bell gets all of this, dancing down the track for the third time and lifting it stylishly over mid-on's head for four;
118.3;?;North to Bell, no run more expansive this time, Bell skipping up the track and unfurling a drive to mid-off;
118.2;?;North to Bell, no run Bell down the wicket straight away but only to nudge this back to North;
118.1;1;North to Pietersen, 1 run North chucks it into the clouds and tempts Pietersen into an almighty swish with minimal footwork, loose shot, and it came off the inside edge wide of mid-on for one;
117.6;?;Watson to Bell, no run Watson gets a cheer and plenty of loving pats for his wicket-taking over, finishes with Bell defending off the front foot;
117.5;?;Watson to Bell, no run no slips in place for the new batsman, Watson very full and straight, Bell drives stylishly to mid-on and holds the pose for a while. Must have liked it;
117.4;W;Watson to PD Collingwood, OUT Watson strikes! Believe it or not. Good delivery, just nipped back a fraction, Collingwood was hanging back when he should have been forward and it trapped him in front. No question of reviewing that;Paul Collingwood lbw b Watson 42 (92m 70b 5x4 0x6) SR: 60;
117.3;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run driven crisply straight to short cover;
117.2;?;Watson to PD Collingwood, no run Watson is very straight, as is Collingwood's defensive blade;

116.4;?;North to PD Collingwood, no run more gentle flight from North, pushed away to cover;
116.3;?;North to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood pokes this to a tumbling Katich at short leg. It bounced, before you ask;
116.2;2;North to PD Collingwood, 2 runs again given plenty of air from North, Collingwood happily pushes square of the wicket on the off side to bring up yet another England 100-run partnership;
116.1;?;North to PD Collingwood, no run tossed up nicely, Collingwood plays back in defence;
115.6;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run maiden over and Pietersen remains stuck on 158;
115.5;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run very firmly driven once more, this was a touch wider though, which is something for the bowler to hang on to;
115.4;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run Watson looks like a bowling machine set on "full" (if that is how they worked, which of course they don't), Pietersen drives said full ball, but picks out mid-off;
115.3;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run Three times Pietersen has made 158 and only once has he gone past it, Watson keeps him pinned on it here with a length ball on off stump;
115.2;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run Pietersen is on the drive again and plays it nicely but straight to cover;
115.1;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run Watson starts with a full, drive-me ball, Pietersen does drive but not with complete certainty and it runs off the inside edge;
114.6;1;North to Pietersen, 1 run short, pulled very hard out to Bollinger at deep square;
114.5;?;North to Pietersen, no run forward defence this time;
114.4;4;North to Pietersen, FOUR runs swept again, four more! There are two men out there, but he's got it right between them. A tired-looking Bollinger sprinted round but couldn't get to it;
114.3;4;North to Pietersen, FOUR runs that has rocketed to the leg-side boundary! A powerful sweep, mostly along the ground, and he's split the field. 150 for Pietersen;
114.2;1;North to PD Collingwood, 1 run Collingwood skips down the track and is almost beaten in the flight but gets bat and pad right together and picks up one as the ball squirts behind point;
114.1;?;North to PD Collingwood, no run full outside off, Collingwood lunges forward to smother the spin;
113.6;4;Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs muscled with great authority to the midwicket boundary. There are only two fielders on the leg side - the plan was obviously to continue wide of off - but Bollinger dishes one up full on middle and leg;
113.5;1;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run Collingwood looks to open up the leg side, stepping right across to off and glancing down to fine leg;
113.4;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run just short of a good length, pitching on off stump. Solidly defended by Collingwood, right under the eyes;
113.3;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run very full, very wide and left alone. Yawn;
113.2;1;Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run full of length on off stump, Pietersen shuffles across and clips just wide of midwicket for one;
113.1;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run angled full and very wide across Pietersen, who steps across to leave;
113.1;1w;Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 wide no pace in the delivery, but slammed in halfway down. That balloons over the batsman, and is called wide. Dougie doesn't like it, and to be honest that was a slightly harsh call;
112.6;2;North to PD Collingwood, 2 runs a touch too short, Collingwood hangs back and aims a delicate late cut behind square for a couple more;
112.5;?;North to PD Collingwood, no run pushed defensively to cover off the back foot;
112.4;?;North to PD Collingwood, no run an inside-edged drive dribbles back to the bowler;
112.3;?;North to PD Collingwood, no run arm ball, outside off, and it rushes straight on. Spotted by Collingwood, who leaves;
112.2;2;North to PD Collingwood, 2 runs turn and bounce again, Collingwood gets across to off and rides it to pick up two to fine leg;
112.1;?;North to PD Collingwood, no run big turn straight away for the offpsinner! That's turned a foot from outside off. That'll please Swann...;
111.6;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run a tempting line on or around off stump, but Pietersen pulls his bat inside the line as the ball passes him. Left, rather than beaten;
111.5;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run full, wide, and left alone. Australia are just hoping for a mistake from Pietersen here;
111.4;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run Pietersen leans forward into a solid defence;
111.3;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run appeal for lbw from the bowler, but that's hopelessly optimistic. Huge inside edge onto the pad;
111.2;4;Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs flashed behind square! Pietersen's patience finally evaporated and he went really hard at this one outside off. Pleading cry of "catch!" from the bowler, but it goes wide of gully. Not too far away though;
111.1;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run Bollinger persists with this outside-off-stump line, and Pietersen isn't tempted - yet;
110.6;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run a mercifully defensive end to the over by Collingwood as he defends to off;
110.5;4;Doherty to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs four more to the midwicket boundary with a powerful front foot nurdle. 100 up for Doherty, and he's disconsolate;
110.4;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run worked firmly into the leg side, but the ball thumps into Katich at short leg. Ouch;
110.3;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run Doherty adjusts his line to off stump, Collingwood defends;
110.2;4;Doherty to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs too full on leg stump, and Collingwood's bottom hand sends the ball out to the deep midwicket boundary. Easily done;
110.1;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run nice and full, just outside off. Collingwood steps forward and pushes to cover;
109.6;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run accurate finish to the over, landing just outside off and Pietersen gets some bat on this one - but only to defend;
109.5;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run even further away from the off stump this time. Pietersen steps forward aggressively, but whips his bat up to leave;
109.4;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run that's the plan, outside off and on a length. Pietersen leaves;
109.3;2;Bollinger to Pietersen, 2 runs a 7/2 offside field, but again Bollinger aims at leg stump and is clipped to fine leg. Punter is nonplussed;
109.2;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run pushed wider of off, left alone by Pietersen;
109.1;2;Bollinger to Pietersen, 2 runs Pietersen walks down towards the off side and flicks cheekily out on the leg side, plenty of space there;
108.6;2;Doherty to PD Collingwood, 2 runs whipped off the back foot out to long leg;
108.5;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run too short from Doherty, width on offer too, but Collingwood slaps it straight to cover;
108.4;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run more watchful, cautious batting from Collingwood;
108.3;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run defended off the front foot this time;
108.2;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run extravagant turn and bounce this time! This almost evaded Haddin's reach outside off it turned so much. Landed in a foot-hole, but they're quite far outside off;
108.1;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run more turn and bounce for Doherty, but again it's much too far away from the batsman to get him playing;
107.6;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run and another leave to finish the over as Pietersen decides, wisely, not to play at this;
107.6;1w;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 wide a rash drive! This was really wide, it went away through the air and off the pitch and Pietersen just threw the bat at it. Lucky not to edge that. It's so wide that it's called as such by the umpire;
107.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run Siddle is testing Pietersen's patience outside the off stump here, landing this on a length and a foot away from him on the off side. Pietersen resists the urge, and leaves alone;
107.4;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run well, having said that this one goes dead straight through the air and then does absolutely nothing off the pitch. Well outside off though, and left alone once more;
107.3;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run same ball, same result. Siddle is just getting a little bit out of this old-ish ball in overcast conditions. More off the pitch than through the air;
107.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run this time he opts for safety and raises his arms above his head to shoulder arms to a length delivery outside off;
107.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run Pietersen is beaten on the drive. He needn't have played at this one, it was full but very wide and seamed further away off the pitch;
106.6;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run tossed up gently on middle, Collingwood steps forward to smother what spin there is;
106.5;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood is back and defending this time;
106.4;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run defended watchfully into the covers;
106.3;1;Doherty to Pietersen, 1 run driven hard out to the cover boundary;
106.2;?;Doherty to Pietersen, no run turn and bounce for Doherty, but unfortunately the ball landed well outside off stump and Pietersen had nothing to do with it;
106.1;6;Doherty to Pietersen, SIX runs up, up and over long-off! Is that England's first six of the series? You'd have backed KP to hit it. Slapped inside-out over the infield after a confident shimmy down the track;
105.6;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run landing on a length just outside off and seaming away off the pitch, Collingwood steps forward into a leave;
105.5;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run aimed right at middle and much fuller, Collingwood digs it out towards mid-on;
105.4;4;Siddle to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs through the off side this time! Driven on the up wide of mid-off with a resounding crack off the bat, great timing. Up comes the fifty partnership;
105.3;4;Siddle to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs this wasn't all that short, but Collingwood picked up the length very early and set himself for a powerful pull through midwicket;
105.2;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run punched hard through the off side for one;
105.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run length delivery thumped on the up - and on the walk - to mid-off;
104.6;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run much quicker through the air, really fired in, and Collingwood is beaten by the extra pace as the ball thuds into his pad. Going well down leg though;
104.5;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood lunges forward to defend once more;
104.4;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run fuller on off stump - a decent, if not dangerous, delivery - is defended off the front foot;
104.3;?;Doherty to PD Collingwood, no run Colly stays deep in the crease and defends to cover;
104.2;2;Doherty to PD Collingwood, 2 runs again Collingwood aims leg side to a full delivery, more authoritative stroke this time and they get back for the second;
104.1;2;Doherty to PD Collingwood, 2 runs flighted very full on leg stump, Collingwood steps forward and almost yorks himself but jams the bat down hard to send the ball into the leg side - via a ricochet off Katich under the helmet at short leg;
103.6;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run just a defensive push from Pietersen, but it springs off the middle of the bat with a real crack. Straight to extra cover though, so no run;
103.5;1;Siddle to PD Collingwood, 1 run inside edge! Collingwood was looking to clip to midwicket, a thick edge struck the back pad and Pietersen called him through for a sharp single straight away;
103.4;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run this time Collingwood shuffles half forward to a good length delivery just outside off and defends to cover;
103.3;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run back of a length this time. Collingwood doesn't move his feet much but defends right under his eyes effectively enough;
103.2;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run straighter from Siddle, and Collingwood steps forward to drive to mid-off;
103.1;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run full and quite wide, Pietersen flings a flashing square drive at the ball to send it out to deep point;
102.6;4;Doherty to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs Collingwood finds the boundary with a classic nurdle - a no-nonsense bottom-handed shovel that threads the gap at midwicket and races away;
102.5;1;Doherty to Pietersen, 1 run eased to wide mid-on;
102.4;4;Doherty to Pietersen, FOUR runs Doherty slips down the leg side and is promptly swept down to fine leg. Strong shoot, he just helped it on its way;
102.3;?;Doherty to Pietersen, no run tossed up a lot slower and fuller, a touch of grip off the surface but nothing extravagant;
102.2;?;Doherty to Pietersen, no run KP has a look and taps back to the bowler;
102.1;?;Doherty to Pietersen, no run hurled down flat and fast to start, and Doherty is lucky to get away with this one as it's short and wide - slapped straight to short extra cover;
101.6;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run swings again after passing the stumps, and after such a barren day yesterday, it's good to see some movement;
101.5;4b;Siddle to PD Collingwood, 4 byes swing! Actual, real bonafide swing! Happened after it past the batsman, just curled past a diving Haddin to run away for four. Looked like reverse as well, so it's possible;
101.4;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run back of a length, Collingwood punches a block;
101.3;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood much more secure in defence this time, crunching forward to block;
101.2;2;Siddle to PD Collingwood, 2 runs better shot this time, Collingwood standing tall and punching through cover for a couple;
101.1;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run beaten, poor shot to a good ball, fullish outside off, Collingwood just pushed at it a fraction;
100.6;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run another edge, inside this time and it trickles to mid-on;
100.5;1;Harris to PD Collingwood, 1 run edgy drive goes all along the ground towards point where it bursts through the hands;
100.4;4;Harris to PD Collingwood, 4 runs Collingwood is away with an all-run four, not sure the fielding was very sharp there, pushed past mid-off with a hint of inside edge;
100.3;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run slightly tired delivery this time, down on pace and outside off stump, left all alone;
100.2;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood remains pinned on 0, but no alarm, just leaving outside off;
100.1;1;Harris to Pietersen, 1 run no bouncer this time, instead it's the double bluff, very full and meets an even fuller face, pushing to mid-on for a swift single;
99.6;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run fuller and attacking off stump, good delivery really and Collingwood defends off an inside edge. 10 balls on 0 now;
99.5;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run order restored with Collingwood leaving alone outside off stump;
99.4;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run short again, this time the pull shot finds the fielder but Pietersen is clearly expecting the tactic;
99.3;4;Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs Pietersen was waiting in position for this very early, set himself up like a baseball player ready to swing a pull shot, Siddle serves up a half-tracker and it's slapped to the boundary;
99.2;4;Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs well Siddle is trying to buy a wicket and if the short balls don't get up it is going to cost plenty, this doesn't and Pietersen was waiting for it, pulled powerfully with one leg up in the air;
99.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run this is indeed banged in short, sharpish too and Pietersen had to pull out of an attempted hook shot at the last minute;
98.6;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run end of a tidy over, Harris didn't look very comfortable throughout though;
98.5;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run good pace and carry but the line is still too wide;
98.4;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood forced to defend and does so comfortably enough off the back foot;
98.3;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run touch of extra bounce here, good wheels too but too wide of off to interest a new batsman;
98.2;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run again Collingwood gets a sighter outside off stump and again Harris looks plenty uncomfortable;
98.1;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run starts outside off and left alone, Harris full of grimaces. Doesn't look good;
97.6;2;Bollinger to Pietersen, 2 runs yup, Pietersen is clearly wanting to entertain which makes things exciting, if a little insecure, this is flapped over mid-off, not timed but it loops over for a couple;
97.5;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run slammed to mid-off, Bollinger down on pace and serving up a full delivery that Pietersen goes very hard at;
97.4;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run in response Bollinger shoves this well outside off and Pietersen isn't tempted;
97.3;4;Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs extraordinary shot, Pietersen skips down the wicket outside off stump to whip this in front of midwicket for four;
97.2;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run pushed across Pietersen with the left-armer angle, left alone outside off;
97.1;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run Pietersen looks in the mood to dominate, or try to at least, he swishes hard at a drive and doesn't time it;
96.6;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood looks a little flat footed and stabs a defence to a length ball outside off;
96.5;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run good ball first up, hanging around off stump, Collingwood reluctant to get forward and jabs a defence;
96.4;W;Harris to Cook, OUT Alastair Cook is out! Finally. Harris deserved that, sharp ball on a good length, Cook was back when he should have been forward and it came back between bat and pad, clipping a faint inside edge and Haddin took a good catch diving to his right;Alastair Cook c ?Haddin b Harris 148 (428m 269b 18x4 0x6) SR: 55.01;
96.3;2;Harris to Cook, 2 runs oops! Misfield from Clarke at cover allows a routine push to cover to become two;
96.2;1;Harris to Pietersen, 1 run and again! Very sharp bouncer, Pietersen wanted to make a statement by taking it on but it was too quick for him and he ended up skewing over the infield into space. Lucky;
96.1;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run woah! Pietersen gets in a horrid tangle here. Sharp bounces, Pietersen was getting forward and aimed a hook but it was on him in a flash and thudded into his gloves near his face, he had no idea what was going on;
95.6;?;Bollinger to Cook, no run Cook steps forward and presents the fullest of faces to a length ball;
95.5;?;Bollinger to Cook, no run quiet and resolute defence. Spirit-sapping stuff if you're an Australian;
95.4;1;Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run short again and nudged around the corner for another single;
95.3;4;Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs emphatic response from the batsman, horrid ball to be fair, short and sitting up, Pietersen thwacked it well in front of square for four;
95.2;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run beaten! Ball actually goes past the edge of bat! Merciful. Good delivery from Bollinger, slower ball and Pietersen was in position far too early;
95.1;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run full from Bollinger but too wide to interest Pietersen;
94.6;?;Harris to Cook, no run driven crisply again this time but straight to extra cover;
94.5;?;Harris to Cook, no run clipped off the pads firmly to midwicket;
94.4;?;Harris to Cook, no run nothing at all happening with the new ball, Cook has an age to defend of the back foot;
94.3;2;Harris to Cook, 2 runs runs flowing this morning, overpitched and Cook leans into an extra-cover drive for a couple more;
94.2;1;Harris to Pietersen, 1 run century for Pietersen, he punches the air! Short ball from Harris, Pietersen stood tall again and dropped it into the leg side to scamper through to the landmark;
94.1;4;Harris to Pietersen, FOUR runs lovely shot! Harris goes full and Pietersen steps into it and clips firmly past mid-on and it races away for four to bring him on to 99;

Look out Alastair Cook! Pietersen's last hundred was against West Indies in March last year.
 Innings Start
England win by an innings and 71 runs, and take a priceless 1-0 lead with three Tests to be played. Swann had been identified as the man to spearhead England's push on the fifth day and he's done just that, finishing with 5 for 91to bowl England to their 100th Test win over Australia. The hosts suffer the ignominy of their first innings defeat at home since their capitulation to the West Indies at Perth in 1993 and, to be brutally honest, it's hard to see them bouncing back to win two of the next three games to reclaim the urn. Stranger things have happened, of course, but Australia will need something truly inspirational.
Andrew Strauss's decision to bat on on the fourth morning is vindicated by the eventual result - the 69 runs added tallying nicely with the victory by an innings and 71. England will be slighted dented by the loss of Broad, but they've got the likes of Chris Tremlett, Ajmal Shahzad and Tim Bresnan as back-up. Tremlett, in particular, could be a real handful at the WACA, while Shahzad has the ability to reverse the old ball.
"We got off to a shambolic start to the Test match, and it was always going to be hard to fight back from there," says Ricky Ponting. "We needed to make a big score in the first innings and 245 was never going to be enough. We also put down a few crucial catches in the field. It's just those little things which are literally slipping through our hands at the moment, you can't give good players second and third chances. We've got to go away and do some soul-searching. England have kept us under real pressure, and we've got to find a way to cope with that."
"You're always thinking back to what happened here four years ago and asking 'could Australia find a way to get back into this game?' but we were pretty clinical out there. A lot of boxes ticked in this game," says Andrew Strauss, adding the obligatory comment about being careful of complacency. "When you're confident things start happening for you as a matter of course, you don't have to push it," he says of England's dramatic start to this Test with the ball.
"Even when Hussey was getting them back in the game, they weren't going anywhere and we always find if we could just get one wicket we'd be ahead again. Swann did a great job of strangling the batsmen in the first innings too. Batsmen like to score runs, and if they can't they get a bit edgy," adds Strauss, who also makes special mention of how pleased he is that KP has his swagger back.
"We've got some good momentum, but the guys are pretty tired after back to back Tests and certainly some of the bowlers will need a rest. And maybe some of the batsmen too. The loss of Broad will be very big, he's been a senior bowler for us, but we've got three guys bowling well and who are all chomping at the bit to get out there. We'll take into account how they bowl at the MCG, but I do have some plans.
"To put the ghosts of four years ago to bed is really good for us. The last six days or so have been outstanding cricket for us."
Well, it all happened very quickly in the first session and it's a surprisingly early finish for your commentary team. From me, Liam Brickhill, and Sahil Dutta it's goodbye. Thanks for all the mail, we do read absolutely everything and try to get as much in as possible. Your company has been warmly appreciated on some long winter nights here at Cricinfo Towers in London. Before you go, Brydon's Coverdale's bulletin is, as always, well worth a read - although possibly not if you're a fan of Australia. Goodbye for now.
99.1;W;Swann to Siddle, OUT there it is! Classic offspinner's dismissal, drawing him forward and spinning back sharply from outside off to fizz through bat and pad and clatter into off stump;Peter Siddle b Swann 6 (28m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 27.27;
98.6;?;Finn to Bollinger, no run a flat-footed, airy waft outside off that is fortunate not to bring an outside edge;
98.5;?;Finn to Bollinger, no run bouncer, telegraphed somewhat by Finn and Bollinger is easily under it;
98.4;?;Finn to Bollinger, no run Bollinger rides the bounce of a back of a length delivery, and then almost sets off for a non-existent single;
98.3;4;Finn to Bollinger, FOUR runs steered through gully! That could have gone anywhere, and ended up rolling over the boundary at third man;
98.2;?;Finn to Bollinger, no run Bollinger pokes at a delivery that leaves him off the pitch and then, with the ball safely in Prior's gloves, whips his bat away to leave ... don't think he fooled anyone there;
98.1;?;Finn to Bollinger, no run not quite full enough to drive, but Dougie leans forward and pushes to cover all the same;
97.6;?;Swann to Siddle, no run play and a miss outside off, this one didn't turn;
97.5;?;Swann to Siddle, no run cracked firmly back down the wicket, Dougie stretches back to get into his crease at the non-striker's end and the ball ricochets off his bat and down towards long-off as he tumbles over at the crease ...;
97.4;1;Swann to Bollinger, 1 run very full on the leg stump, Bollinger clips against the spin into the leg side to bring up Australia's 300;
97.3;?;Swann to Bollinger, no run Bollinger stretches out to defend a flighted offspinner, delivered from around the wicket;

96.6;?;Anderson to Bollinger, no run swinging in from round the wicket, Bollinger leaves alone and the ball cannons off his pad and rolls to leg;
96.5;?;Anderson to Bollinger, no run edged just short of slip this time! Thick edge, and played with soft hands. Dropping well short;
96.4;?;Anderson to Bollinger, no run intentionally played? I think not, as Bollinger pokes with no great certainty and somehow finds himself in a position to play a late cut. On the bounce to Prior;
96.3;1;Anderson to Siddle, 1 run nudged into the leg side, between mid-on and midwicket, and they take a quick single;
96.2;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run fuller this time, again Siddle pushes the ball gently back from whence it came;

95.3;?;Swann to Bollinger, no run looped up very full and almost sneaking under the bat! Bollinger very nearly played over the top of this, but brought the bat down just in time to keep it out;
95.2;?;Swann to Bollinger, no run well, solid defence first up. But how long can it last?;
95.1;W;Swann to Doherty, OUT Swann gets another one! Doherty is bowled, top of middle. He played forward, but positioned himself for extravagant turn when there was none. The ball snuck through the gap between bat and pad and clattered into the stumps. Australia nine down now, England are very, very close;Xavier Doherty b Swann 5 (17m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;

94.5;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run Siddle is clinging on gamely here, defending a length delivery back down the track;
94.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run short outside the off stump, Siddle sways out of the way;
94.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run inswinger again from Anderson, but just short of a good length this time and defended to leg;
94.2;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run probing line! Swinging in, full and aimed right at the middle stump. Siddle jams the bat down in time;
94.1;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run good length delivery shaping away from the off stump, Siddle stands at the crease to defend;
93.6;4;Swann to Doherty, FOUR runs a rare loose ball from Swann, and Doherty steps back to slap it out to deep cover... for what it's worth;
93.5;?;Swann to Doherty, no run blocked, on the bounce, to the man under the helmet at silly mid-off;
93.4;?;Swann to Doherty, no run brave leave! But, ultimately, a well-judged one as the ball fizzes six inches past the off stump;

92.5;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run Anderson locates a fuller length here but the line is too wide of off to draw a shot;
92.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run bat-jarring length, but Siddle looks secure there and defends well;
92.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run back of a length again from Anderson, should be fuller really, Siddle gets back to defend;
92.2;1;Anderson to Doherty, 1 run fuller this time, Doherty walks across his stumps to flick a single to fine leg;
92.1;?;Anderson to Doherty, no run well well, doesn't get it but it's a short ball that spears up at Doherty who defends uncomfortably, could easily have been fended off into where short leg should have been;
91.6;?;Swann to Siddle, no run hit the stumps but the bails stay on! Siddle defends carefully and it runs back onto the stumps;
91.5;?;Swann to Siddle, no run this again bobbles out into the off side, Swann bowling grenades now;
91.4;?;Swann to Siddle, no run this spits off a length outside off, and flies out into the off side. Plenty of shouts from the England fielders but no reason why;
91.3;?;Swann to Siddle, no run Siddle stretches forward to defend, the Barmy Army are in full voice;
91.2;W;Swann to North, OUT another massive appeal from England as North played around his front pad and was struck in front. Given not out initially but England reviewed, North got a big stride in as he thrust bat and pad together, it hit pad first, in front and Hawk Eye confirms it hitting! North gone and Australia have crumbled here this morning;Marcus North lbw b Swann 22 (56m 35b 3x4 0x6) SR: 62.85;
91.1;?;Swann to North, no run Swann finds turn and bounce, plenty of chat from the England fielders, they know they are on the verge of victory;
90.6;W;Anderson to Harris, OUT gone! King pair for Harris! Anderson aimed the inswinger at a full length, Harris left alone and it crashed into the front pad bang in front.

90.5;W;Anderson to Haddin, OUT Anderson gets his man! Finally this is full enough to drag Haddin forward, the full length means the ball can swing and nibble off the pitch, flicks a faint edge as Haddin aims a drive and Prior does the rest. England are through to the tail now!;Brad Haddin c ?Prior b Anderson 12 (24m 21b 2x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;

89.6;?;Swann to North, no run resolute defence to finish Swann's comeback over;
89.5;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run very easily played, Haddin sleepily clips this to long-on for a jogged single, plenty of Mark Waugh in that;

88.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run back of a length, no swing from there, Haddin gets back to defend to cover;
88.2;1;Anderson to North, 1 run no great swing here, the length is a touch short for it, North works it around the corner for a single;

87.6;?;Finn to Haddin, no run left well alone to end a decent over;
87.5;2;Finn to Haddin, 2 runs Haddin is a sweet timer, without a hint of effort he collects two with a nudge to deep square;

87.2;1;Finn to North, 1 run worked into the square leg region for a riskless single;
87.1;?;Finn to North, no run bat-jarring lengths and lines again from Finn as North defends;
86.6;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs poor delivery, Anderson searches for the magic ball and as he found out throughout his younger days, it doesn't exist, Haddin flicks powerfully to the midwicket rope;
86.5;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs ah lovely shot, driven on the up with a minimum of effort, stroked through cover;
86.4;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run this time Haddin has nothing to do with it, judging the swing to take it wide of off;

85.3;1;Finn to North, 1 run splice-jarring length again from Finn, North works it to deep square where some sharp fielding from Trott keeps it to one;
85.3;5w;Finn to North, 5 wide Finn has bowled superbly this match but has just landed the worst delivery of the series here, shoving this miles down the leg side, barely hit the cut strip;
85.2;W;Finn to Hussey, OUT Finn strikes! The big wicket of Hussey! Banged in short from around the wicket, Hussey tried to fetch the pull shot from around off stump but it nipped back and tucked him up, could only top-edge and send it looping to Anderson at mid-on who took the chance and roared in the direction of the Barmy Army;Michael Hussey c Anderson b Finn 52 (154m 107b 5x4 1x6) SR: 48.59;
85.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run massive, pleading appeal from Finn and the slips as Hussey is trapped on the pads from a full ball, it was probably slipping past leg stump on the angle from around the wicket;
84.6;?;Anderson to North, no run left well alone to end a good over for Australia, they have looked positive this morning;
84.5;4;Anderson to North, FOUR runs cry of "caaaatch" from the England fielders but there was no getting, wide full delivery, bit of a gift really, North creamed it through cover for four;

84.1;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run starts fullish but around leg stump and worked into the leg side for a single;
83.6;?;Finn to North, no run good finish to a loosener over, touch more bite on this, lands on a fullish length, nips back a fraction and North defends uneasily;
83.5;1lb;Finn to Hussey, 1 leg bye another delivery down the leg side, Hussey gleefully flicks it to fine leg for one;
83.4;1;Finn to North, 1 run banged in just short of a good length, North stands tall to work it around the corner for a single;
83.3;?;Finn to North, no run North stands tall in defence around off stump, no dramatic pace or movement with the new cherry as yet;

83.1;4;Finn to North, FOUR runs ooh, edgy start to the new ball, outside off stump and it flies off the edge wide of the slips for four;
82.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run beaten! Savage turn and bounce, it flew up, glanced the edge and Prior dropped it. Touch chance because it spun quickly and bounced, Prior tried to ride the bounce but it hit him on the shoulder and bobbled away, he scrambled after it but couldn't grab it;
82.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey negotiates another quite comfortably;
82.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run carefully defended this time, plenty of spin about;
82.3;4;Swann to Hussey, FOUR runs fifty for Hussey! How well he's played again this series, gets there by skipping down the wicket and flicking firmly to Morgan at square leg who makes a hash of the save and can't catch it up;
82.2;1;Swann to North, 1 run North gets away from the business end by pushing a single into space;
82.1;?;Swann to North, no run first drama of the day! North gets in a tangle defending around his front pad, it struck him on the pad, England had a long appeal but it was given not out. After a careful discussion England opted for a gamble review but it only confirmed that it struck outside the line;

79.3;?;Pietersen to North, no run Pietersen begins by dragging one down short, spins and North stands tall to defend back to the bowler;
79.2;W;Pietersen to Clarke, OUT Pietersen has the breakthrough! Huge wicket! It spun in sharply from outside off and Clarke got into a tangle as he tried to turn this to leg. It came via a thick inside edge on to the thigh and ballooned to Cook at short leg. Clarke set off until he realised there was no decision made by the umpire, England had to review straight away and it proved the significant inside edge.;Michael Clarke c Cook b Pietersen 80 (170m 139b 11x4 0x6) SR: 57.55;
79.1;?;Pietersen to Clarke, no run Pietersen lands a decent first delivery, pitching outside off and spinning back in, Clarke defends;

78.4;2;Finn to Clarke, 2 runs Finn angles into the pads and Clarke tucks it away to midwicket, scampering a couple;
78.3;?;Finn to Clarke, no run good pace and carry but the line is not as smart, too wide to interest Clarke;
78.2;?;Finn to Clarke, no run this starts wide and jags away a touch further, but too wide of off stump to entertain Clarke;
78.1;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Finn hits the deck back of a length around off, doesn't find anything other than Clarke's broad defensive blade;
77.6;?;Pietersen to Hussey, no run left well alone outside off stump, Australia counting down the overs;
77.5;?;Pietersen to Hussey, no run Hussey with studious, resolute defence stretching forward;
77.4;1;Pietersen to Clarke, 1 run dragged down short and very wide, that will happen with a part-timer, Clarke pounces by cutting to deep point;
77.3;3;Pietersen to Hussey, 3 runs Pietersen around the wicket to the left-hander, not enough spin though and Hussey tickles it fine with the angle to bring up the 100 partnership;
77.2;1;Pietersen to Clarke, 1 run Clarke uses the angle created by the spin to nudge this around the corner for a single;
77.1;?;Pietersen to Clarke, no run starts tidily enough outside off and spinning back, Clarke defends;

76.4;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Finn changes his length, heading for the top of off with a fuller one, Clarke's defiance is unshakable;
76.3;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Clarke into position very early to defend to cover, he looks very busy;
76.2;2;Finn to Clarke, 2 runs just short of a length again around off stump and this time Clarke tugs it to deep midwicket, that strange jab-shot of him;

75.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run calm and careful stroke to cover;
75.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run blocked carefully once more into the off side;
75.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run touch of flight, Hussey strokes to cover carefully;
75.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run more careful in defence this time;
75.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run oh! That is ludicrously close! Hussey attempted a sweep and it spun past the shot, hit the arm bounced by the stumps but spun past them;
75.1;6;Swann to Hussey, SIX runs bang! Horrid full toss that Hussey clatters into the crowds over deep midwicket;
74.6;?;Finn to Clarke, no run back of a length, Clarke stands tall and punches to mid-off to end the over;
74.5;?;Finn to Clarke, no run this time it's left alone more securely outside off;
74.4;?;Finn to Clarke, no run back of a length outside off stump, Clarke thinks about pulling, thinks about cutting, thinks about leaving, and does a suspicious combination of all three;
74.3;?;Finn to Clarke, no run this is outside off stump and even in his aggressive mood Clarke is happy to leave alone;
74.2;?;Finn to Clarke, no run more bite on this, touch of extra bounce and back into Clarke, raps him on the thigh as he tries to turn it to leg;
74.1;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run angled into the pads on a full length from around the wicket, bit of a gentle loosener that and Hussey flicks around the corner for a single;
73.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke is a man in a hurry, he's got the bit between his teeth as they say, swings madly at this and it thuds into the pads;
73.5;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run this is securely worked into space for one;
73.4;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run ooh, this spins sharply and finds the glove and goes airily into an area where leg gully could, should have been;
73.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run dropped tough chance, just hit Cook's knee at short leg, not really a chance at all as Clarke flicked firmly;
73.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run more twinkle-toed defiance from Clarke, super stuff;
73.1;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke skips again up the track to drive crisply to cover;
72.6;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run another wide offcutter, another leave from Hussey;
72.5;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run lobbed up outside off, too wide to get Hussey playing though;
72.4;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run straighter from Collingwood, defended to cover;
72.3;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run definite plan for Hussey here, pitched up outside off and spinning away. Patiently left alone though;
72.2;1;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run good-looking on-drive from Clarke, out to deep mid-on;
72.1;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run played with the turn to leg;
71.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run taken on the full toss and slapped to mid-on;
71.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run;
71.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run full, driven back to the bowler;
71.3;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run well, Clarke is ready to take on the challenge of the raging spin here, jumping out and swinging mightily to leg. A thick inside edge goes through midwicket;
71.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run more spin, but played safely to mid-on this time;
71.1;4b;Swann to Clarke, 4 byes that has exploded off the surface! Beating Clarke's inside edge and too good for Prior as well! That has taken a divet out of the top of the surface and spun extravagantly. Encouraging signs for the spinner;
70.6;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run quick offspinner dished up full and wide of off - a dangerous delivery as it grips and spins away, and recognised as such by Hussey, who leaves it well alone;
70.5;1;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run full, straight and slow through the air. Again Clarke clips into the leg side for one;
70.4;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run hint of width outside off, Hussey seizes on it to pick up one to cover;
70.3;1;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run floated up very full and landing on leg stump, Clarke glances to leg for a single;
70.2;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run solid defence to the offcutter;
70.1;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run from round the wicket, Hussey nudges to square leg for one;
69.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run this time, just to mix things up, he plays back in defence;
69.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke skips down again, driving hard but straight to short extra;
69.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run testing stuff from Swann, but resolute defence from Clarke;
69.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke shimmies down to defend;
69.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run more spin for Swann, defended to leg this time;
69.1;?;Swann to Clarke, no run spinning in sharply, Clarke plays back and taps to cover;
68.6;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run another spinning offcutter, but another leave from Hussey;
68.5;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run definite turn for Collingwood! This grips into the surface and spins away, but Hussey leaves well alone;
68.4;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run watchful defence once more;
68.3;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run Collingwood aims at off stump this time, Hussey defends;
68.2;4;PD Collingwood to Hussey, FOUR runs edged, and flying past slip! It was the offcutter, landing right in the footholes outside off as Hussey went forward to drive. A thick edge flew past a leaping Anderson at slip, a really tough chance. Would've been the catch of the season;
68.1;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run Collingwood comes round the wicket to Hussey, who defends a full ball to leg;
67.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run ooh, a painful blow on the behind for Alastair Cook! Clarke responds to the appeal for a wicket with a powerful sweep that smashes straight into Cook's rump as he turns away at short leg. He's certainly smarting from the blow, but a quick pat on the affected area from Colly and he's fine...;
67.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke skips down, doesn't get to the pitch and the ball rips into the pad and flies to slip. Huge appeal from England for the catch and he's given! Clarke immediately shakes his head and asks for a review. And rightly so, as he hasn't got a touch on it! The decision is reversed;
67.4;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run just too full this time, but nicely flighted as Hussey taps just wide of cover and sets off for a quick single;
67.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey charges out but Swann spots him coming and pulls the length back, forcing a hurried defensive stroke;
67.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run landing on leg and spinning to off, Hussey defends to midwicket;
67.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run great length from Swann, and Hussey stretches forward to defend;
66.6;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run accurate end to the over, but equally adept defensive batting from Clarke;
66.5;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run offcutter, but not much movement as Clarke defends;
66.4;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run a hint of width on offer, Clarke steps back and tries to force through cover but hits the field;
66.3;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run solid forward defence from Clarke;
66.2;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run that's better, much fuller on the off stump and Clarke defends;
66.1;4;PD Collingwood to Clarke, FOUR runs not the best of starts from Colly, slipping in a long-hop and Clarke cracks to the midwicket boundary;
65.6;3;Swann to Clarke, 3 runs on the other side of the wicket this time. Again Clarke uses his feet to get to the pitch and works through midwicket. Broad's diving effort on the boundary's edge is just enough to cut it off;
65.5;4;Swann to Clarke, FOUR runs shot! Clarke has total confidence in his footwork here, jumping out like Trumper to thrash this through cover. He's looked better and better as his innings as gone on;
65.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run this time he makes the right decision in playing back, defending what looked like the arm ball with a straight bat;
65.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke mis-reads the length here slightly, playing back when he should've been forward;
65.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke skips down with great balance to get to the pitch and defend;
65.1;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run floated down on leg stump, Hussey gets across and taps to square leg for one as Prior races after the ball;
64.6;4;Anderson to Clarke, FOUR runs short from Anderson this time, but not the bouncer and not all that quick either. Clarke rocks back and cracks a pull in front of square for another boundary;
64.5;4;Anderson to Clarke, FOUR runs this one goes the other way through the air, but Clarke plays well with soft hands to guide it down past gully and down to third man for four to bring up his half-century. Well-played, and certainly timely;
64.4;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run inswinger from Anderson, and the ball is driven back hard at him;
64.3;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run not a half volley by any means, but Clarke looks to be positive as he steps forward to drive;
64.2;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run a yorker gone wrong? This slips out as a high full toss that takes Clarke somewhat by surprise as he punches back to the bowler;
64.1;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run good length from Anderson, Clarke comes forward and drives on the up to extra cover;
63.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run more over-spin on this delivery and it goes almost straight on from round the wicket, but Hussey plays back, giving him time to adjust and defend to leg;
63.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run drift, grip and sharp spin! That spun right across the face of the bat, too good for Hussey;
63.4;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke skips down and flicks to midwicket for a quick single;
63.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke comes down the track, as is his wont, and defends;
63.2;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run slightly too short from Swann, Hussey steps back and whips into space at midwicket for one;
63.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run quiet start as Hussey defends a full delivery to leg;
62.6;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run a punched drive goes straight to mid-on;
62.5;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run Clarke moves into a good position to drive, but finds the cover fielder;
62.4;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run snaking in through the air and clipped to leg, but straight to the fielder;
62.3;4;Anderson to Clarke, FOUR runs or maybe not, as an Anderson outswinger takes a thick edge and flies through the vacant slip area and down to third man! There's just one slip in place - and two gullys - but actually that might not have carried anyway;
62.2;2;Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs fuller this time, and driven out through the gap at cover over the damp outfield - which will surely hinder what reverse swing there was on offer before the rain break;
62.1;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run loosener from Anderson, but of a decent standard as Clarke punches to short extra cover;
61.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run and Hussey jumps down to get to the pitch and defend;
61.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run defended to off this time;
61.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run left alone outside off, that's quite a tight leave as the ball rushes straight on...;
61.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run and now the line is right too, right on off stump and Hussey aims a fidgety defence at silly mid-off;
61.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run perfect length from Swann, but not quite the right line as Hussey defends;
61.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Swann comes round the wicket, pitching it up on middle and leg. Hussey defends;
60.6;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run full and swinging in, Clarke doesn't quite judge the movement correctly but gets bat on ball;
60.5;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run this time Clarke is nicely in line and defends right out of the middle, adding: "wait on!";
60.4;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run off the outer half of the bat as Clarke defends off the back foot, but straight down and towards gully;
60.3;4;Anderson to Clarke, FOUR runs ah, bad ball from Anderson, sending it down short and wide outside off. Two gullys are in place but Clarke finds perfect placement with the cut;
60.2;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run a sharp single is taken as Hussey places the ball right between mid-off and cover;
60.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run curving from leg to off, defended to cover;
59.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run ... but the response is the same from Clarke as he skips down into a forward defensive;
59.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke is using his feet beautifully here, but can't find a gap in the field as he clips to midwicket;
59.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke pushes a full delivery back to the bowler;
59.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Swann stays round the wicket to Clarke, who skips down to defend;
59.2;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run Hussey jumps out to get to the pitch and drives to cover for one;
59.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Swann comes round the wicket and gets one to rush straight on, Hussey taps to short leg on the bounce;
58.6;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run clipped behind square on the leg side for one;
58.5;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run this one snakes in through the air and Hussey is slightly squared up as he shapes to nudge into the leg side;
58.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run and again! The length was slightly shorter this time but the result was the same. Testing times against a swinging ball;
58.3;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run beaten outside off! Hussey is drawn into a defensive prod by the round-the-wicket line, and swing takes the ball past the outside edge;
58.2;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run swings the other way this time, arcing towards the slips as Hussey leaves alone;
58.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run this shapes in from around the wicket, and Hussey tucks to midwicket;
57.6;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run landing just short of Anderson at a close gully! Hussey pushed out in defence but the ball gripped and spun ... Hussey survives;
57.5;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke picks up a quick single with a dance down the track and a bunt to wide mid-on;
57.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke steps forward and defends to leg now;
57.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run again Clarke shimmies down to try and get to the pitch, and does well to do so;
57.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run tossed up much fuller, Clarke comes down the track and defends;
57.1;?;Swann to Clarke, no run short to start, but the ball doesn't get up very high and Clarke's attempt at a pull goes straight to midwicket;
56.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run driven again, but the gap has been plugged and the ball goes straight to the fielder;
56.5;4;Anderson to Hussey, FOUR runs laced through cover! Full and wide, Hussey leaned forward to crack this right through the gap and away to the boundary. It pitched in the rough, though, and Anderson won't be too unhappy to have Hussey driving;
56.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run nudged into the leg side;
56.3;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run curving away through the air, Hussey hops into a leave;
56.2;2;Anderson to Hussey, 2 runs pitched up and inviting the drive, Hussey picks up two with a firm push through cover;
56.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run full and swinging away from round the wicket, punched to cover;
55.6;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run careful defence to end the session;
55.5;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke collects one this time in the opposite way, helping a slightly shorter ball with the spin to the midwicket region;
55.4;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run neatly done by Hussey, this is how he's played Swann so well this series, sees a touch of air, quick footwork brings him down to meet it and turns to leg for a riskless single;
55.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run quicker, flatter and left alone outside off;
55.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey skips down to defend a length ball;
55.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey stretches forward to defend towards mid-on and for no reason Swann runs after the ball to collect;
54.6;?;Finn to Clarke, no run not a great shot this, but no harm either, Clarke steers away with bat far away from pad to the covers;
54.5;4;Finn to Clarke, FOUR runs Finn grimaces, as well he might, he lost his line and drifted onto Clarke's pads, the batsman makes no mistake and tickles finely for four;
54.4;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run fraction more width here and Hussey pushes to cover to scamper a single;
54.3;?;Finn to Hussey, no run back of a length around off stump, Hussey stands tall to defend solidly;
54.2;1;Finn to Clarke, 1 run banged in a touch short and Clarke whips away one of his front-foot pulls, again it's more edge than meat of the bat but he collects a single for the effort;
54.1;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run nicely bowled, having hung a few outside off moving away from the left-hander, Finn goes fuller with an inswinger, Hussey was up to the task, jabbing into the leg side for a swift single;
53.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run skipping forward defence to finish the over;
53.5;2;Swann to Clarke, 2 runs Swann drops a fraction too short, Clarke hops back and pulls firmly to Broad on the midwicket rope who grimaces as he returns. Two runs brings up Australia's 150;
53.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run quietly prodded into the leg side;
53.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run this lands right in the footmarks with a puff of dust but Clarke is happy in defence;
53.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run more secure here to a shorter ball, staying deep in his crease and prodding to leg. Plenty of turn and bounce out of the footmarks;
53.1;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke thinks about dancing down before deciding against it and as a result looks a little hurried in defence;
52.6;?;Finn to Hussey, no run left well alone outside off stump this time to end an excellent, probing over;
52.5;?;Finn to Hussey, no run touch of reverse again, Hussey's drive is off the outer-half of the bat and the blade twists in his hands as he plays it. Pietersen fields in the gully and falls over while doing so. For no particular reason;
52.4;?;Finn to Hussey, no run this time it's left alone, Finn wonders down the wicket to stare at Hussey. But his Indie-boy beard and haircut somewhat undermine the effect;
52.3;4;Finn to Hussey, FOUR runs ooh, this is full and driven off the edge uppishly past the outstretched hand of Pietersen in the gully;
52.2;?;Finn to Hussey, no run though this is closer to off stump Hussey judges his leave well and shoulders arms;
52.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run beaten again! Plenty of nip here from Finn, he's banging the ball down on a length, rather than put it there as he sometimes does, Hussey fences at it but misses;
51.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke meets this on the half-volley as he dances down but his frive goes straight to Swann;
51.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Swann goes a touch shorter so Clarke stays back and tries to work this to leg but picks out the infield;
51.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke was down the wicket again, didn't quite reach this one and had to push his defence very carefully;
51.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Swann goes a touch fuller so Clarke runs out of his crease to defend securely;
51.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run carefully defended once more, Clarke and Swann share a chat but it looks friendly enough;
51.1;?;Swann to Clarke, no run touch flatter and quicker from Swann, Clarke defends;
50.6;?;Finn to Hussey, no run excellent over ends with Hussey dragged out wide of off defending a ball he should have left alone. The Barmy Army like it and give Finn a cheer;
50.5;?;Finn to Hussey, no run left well alone this time but on the around the wicket angle it's difficult to judge;
50.4;?;Finn to Hussey, no run this is an excellent little spell from Finn, he's been the best of England's quicks today, this lands just outside off stump and finds extra bounce and some away movement to climb past Hussey's edge;
50.3;?;Finn to Hussey, no run much tighter on off stump this time, that's where you want the reverse to happen if you're a bowler, Hussey defends solidly;
50.2;?;Finn to Hussey, no run reverse-swing alert! Nothing dramatic, it was full and wide, but just went a bit wider. Which is exciting;
50.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run Finn around the wicket to Hussey and offers him a drive first ball that Hussey times nicely to a diving Cook at mid-off, smartly fielded again;
49.6;2;Swann to Clarke, 2 runs Swann has had enough of Clarke running at him so pitches this much shorter, allows Clarke to hop back and flick around the corner, lovely batting really;
49.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke this time defends with waltz;
49.4;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run Hussey skips down at Swann this time, meets it on the half volley and clips to leg for one;
49.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run that will keep Swann interested, Hussey wanting to get forward to defend but doesn't quite get far enough and he opens the face to defend to the slips;
49.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run careful defence again, prodded into the off side;
49.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey stretches forward to defend under his eyes;
48.6;?;Finn to Clarke, no run another good Finn over ends with Clarke leaving alone outside off;
48.5;?;Finn to Clarke, no run more tentative getting forward to this delivery and is punished, of sorts, as a result, with the ball squirting off the outer-half of the bat to gully;
48.4;?;Finn to Clarke, no run good decisive footwork from Clarke here, that's what had been missing of late, he strides forward into a defence;
48.3;2;Finn to Clarke, 2 runs not sure about this shot, Clarke just sort of stands tall and jabs a short-arm pull, doesn't look particularly convincing but earns him a couple to deep square;
48.2;?;Finn to Clarke, no run this is outside off stump and left alone;
48.1;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Finn attacks the stumps this time and it keeps a fraction low, Clarke defends resolutely;
47.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run third drive in a row, this time to mid-off;
47.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run more air from Swann, nicely bowled, hint of drift too, Hussey waits again and pats to cover;
47.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run this time he remains in the crease and strokes to cover;
47.3;4;Swann to Hussey, FOUR runs ah lovely shot, down the track again, meets it on the half-volley and clips to the midwicket boundary;
47.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run Hussey down the track again, he's played Swann so well this series, defends quietly;
47.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run flat ball first up that Hussey defends from the crease;
46.6;?;Finn to Clarke, no run excellent over ends with Clarke hurrying on a defence;
46.5;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Collingwood fields sharply at cover to stop Clarke's drive and gets rewarded with some loving pats and coos from the England fielders;
46.4;?;Finn to Clarke, no run big stride forward to defend by Clarke before he screams "waiiit on";
46.3;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run The Huss, no fuss, is away, just back, working it to square leg and scampering off head down for one;
46.2;W;Finn to Watson, OUT the patience works for Finn! He's been so steady outside off stump, nibbling the odd one away, Watson had left so well this innings but can't resist a hard-handed block at this, just flicks the outside edge and goes low to Strauss who holds on to a good catch;Shane Watson c Strauss b Finn 57 (174m 141b 10x4 0x6) SR: 40.42;
46.1;?;Finn to Watson, no run Finn happily continues outside off stump and it's left alone;
45.6;4;Swann to Clarke, FOUR runs aw, that is just perfect, Clarke's two-step routine brings him to the ball in a flash before easing a sweetly-timed cover drive all along the carpet for four;
45.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Two steps forward, one step back, cut against the spin, and all for nothing;
45.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Swann gives this some air outside off, Clarke whizzes down the wicket after it and steers to point;
45.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke carefully defends into the leg side;
45.2;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run this time it's a touch shorter and whipped around the corner for a single;
45.1;?;Swann to Watson, no run Watson stretches forward to defend;
44.6;2;Finn to Clarke, 2 runs Finn ends the over with an attempted yorker, speared in from wide of the crease, Clarke flicks it around the corner;
44.5;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Clarke gets another chance to lift his arms high above his head;
44.4;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Prior, who looks rather terrifying with his new bearded look, gives Finn a cheer here, not entirely sure why because it was nothing more or less than a routine ball outside off that Clarke left alone;
44.3;?;Finn to Clarke, no run again Clarke is a bundle of movement, even just in leaving alone outside off;
44.2;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Clarke has regained that busy, twitchy twinkle to his footwork and he gets forward nicely here in defence;
44.1;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Finn has fixed his radar outside off stump and Clarke defends;
43.6;4;Swann to Watson, FOUR runs dragged down a touch short, sat up begging to be hit and Watson thwacked it a mile over midwicket, beating two men set deep on the leg side;
43.5;?;Swann to Watson, no run careful defence outside off stump;
43.4;?;Swann to Watson, no run this is a touch shorter but Watson thrusts his pad out even further to defend;
43.3;?;Swann to Watson, no run another big stride to defend with low hands under his eyes;
43.2;?;Swann to Watson, no run this time Watson stretches a long way forward to smother the spin;
43.1;?;Swann to Watson, no run ooh, beaten outside off stump! Watson wanted to cut but the ball pitched and burrowed under his bat;
42.6;?;Finn to Clarke, no run Finn finishes a good over by finding an inside edge from Clarke's attempted push to cover, trickles back to the bowler who collects and lingers, looking for a scrap with Clarke. Both men are probably just a bit too kind for all that;
42.5;?;Finn to Clarke, no run touch wider and Clarke doesn't grope this time, instead he leaves alone;
42.4;?;Finn to Clarke, no run ah nicely bowled, this actually nipped away a lot off a length, beat Clarke's defence by a distance;
42.3;?;Finn to Clarke, no run on a good length and on a good line, just how Finn likes it, no extra pace or bounce or things like that, just simple accuracy and patience, Clarke's defence is solid;
42.2;1;Finn to Watson, 1 run drifts on to the pads and Watson picks it off to deep square;
42.1;?;Finn to Watson, no run Finn floats up a full, drive-me ball which Watson does drive but straight to mid-off;
41.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke has his dancing shoes on, skipping down and wide of off to defend;
41.5;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run touch too short from Swann and allows Watson to tickle it into the leg side for a single;
41.4;?;Swann to Watson, no run Watson gets a full toss but can only pat it back to the bowler;
41.3;?;Swann to Watson, no run touch of air, wide of off too, trying to tempt Watson into a thumping drive but he resists stoically;
41.2;?;Swann to Watson, no run Watson thunders forward to defend, it squirts off an inside edge but no real alarm;
41.1;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run Clarke waits in his crease for this Swann delivery, watches the turn from outside off and helps it on its way around the corner for one. Neatly done;
40.6;4;Broad to Watson, FOUR runs this snakes in through the air - a touch of reverse perhaps? - but Watson is more than equal to the task and sends a drive racing to the straight boundary. And that's his fifty!;
40.5;?;Broad to Watson, no run very short again, and Watto ducks well underneath it;
40.4;?;Broad to Watson, no run on a length just outside off ... was that a slower ball too? Either way, Watson is solidly behind it in defence;
40.3;1;Broad to Clarke, 1 run much better direction on the short ball this time, but Clarke keeps his head and swivels into a pull down to fine leg;
40.2;?;Broad to Clarke, no run wasted effort from Broad, steaming in and slamming down a very short ball that flew down the leg side;
40.1;4;Broad to Clarke, FOUR runs just wide of a diving Kevin Pietersen at gully! Broad sent down a full, wide outswinger and Clarke went for it, slicing the drive. The ball dipped just under Pietersen's hand... not far though;
