The West Indies team is making its way out. Watson and Warner are the two openers. It appears to be a sell-out at the venue. Narsingh Deonarine's opening the bowling, they're starting with a spinner.
Hello and welcome to the first of two Twenty20s between Australia and West Indies. The hosts have won the toss and will bat.
Here are the XIs:
Australia: Shane Watson, David Warner, Michael Clarke, Cameron White, David Hussey, Travis Birt, Brad Haddin (wk), Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Tait, Dirk Nannes.
West Indies: Chris Gayle, Lendl Simmons, Narsingh Deonarine, Kieron Pollard, Wavell Hinds, Dwayne Smith, Runako Morton, Denesh Ramdin (wk), Darren Sammy, Nikita Miller, Kemar Roach
 Innings Start
Australia have won this comfortably, though had West Indies prevented that horrendous start to their chase, we would have had a more competitive match. Nevertheless, the crowd would have been entertained, especially in the Australian innings. Join us for the second T20 game on the 23rd.
A few comments from our readers before signing off.
Shafaqat Ali: "Unfair to criticize this WI outfit considering they are without six regular members. Much better PAK team failed to make any mark in any of the formats. I am sure WI will do lot better in T20 World Cup on their home grounds. Good luck Gayle and Co"
Karnail Singh: "Yes Peter Best you read it right. I live in the USA and follow bastketball. There are lots of kids from WI playing bastetball these days just last year a seven footer from WI was drafted during the first round and got paid $32 millions for four years. I talk to one of them he said, "cricket is very expinsive sport"
That's all, folks. Thanks for tuning in. See you in a couple of days. Adios
