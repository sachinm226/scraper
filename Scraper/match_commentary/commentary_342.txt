6.05pm: And now the signal does come, Australia have declared on 492 for 9, giving England 20-odd overs to see out this evening. Again they've made good work of batting first, thanks to their two centurions, Shane Watson and Steven Smith. Take that, haters. The pitch still looks good to bat on, as the likes of Faulkner and Harris showed, but with the new ball and a bit of cloud cover, Australia will fancy their attack to knock a couple over this evening. Winter will be here to call the action in 10... Cheerio

"That Watson drop has cost England this Test," says Damian. "Without his huge innings I don't think the Australian lower order would have batted with such freedom and success."
 Innings Start
2.20pm: Well, England have made their highest score of the series, so... Australia will be happy with an 115-run lead, though they'd like another day to work with it. Twenty overs of tap and then set England 250 in 50? Whatever, I'm sure Michael Clarke will make it interesting. The Aussies will be batting again in 10
144.4;W;Faulkner to Swann, OUT quick and straight and bowled him! Bit of a gap between Swann's bat and pad, a length ball took the inside edge, bit of pad too and then knocked out middle stump.

140.6;?;Faulkner to Kerrigan, no run round the wicket, angled in towards middle stump, Kerrigan crabbily flicks it to midwicket;
140.5;W;Faulkner to Anderson, OUT nicked off, Haddin takes it, he's equalled Marsh! He just couldn't drop that one, right under the eyes and straight into the gloves as Anderson swung hard again, third wicket for Faulkner, who must be doubly pleased now that England are playing a few shots;James Anderson c ?Haddin b Faulkner 4 (12m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40;
140.4;?;Faulkner to Anderson, no run back of a length, not really room to cut but Anderson attempts to Sobers it through the covers anyway, misses;

James Faulkner to resume sledging duties
 Innings Start
That's tea. A session full of entertainment. Australia lead by 226. If they declare at the interval there will be 44 overs left in the day. We'll bring you news as we have it. The last session begins at 4.30pm. UPDATE: Australia have declared. Clarke has just stuck his head in the England dressing room. So it's 227 to win in 44 overs when play resumes.
22.6;4;Broad to Starc, FOUR runs that's a fierce pull, short of a length outside off and he crunched it out to deep midwicket and that's a good over for Australia to end the session;
22.5;1;Broad to Clarke, 1 run short of a length, dropped into the off side;
22.4;4;Broad to Clarke, FOUR runs just wide of mid-off...Clarke drove on the up, didn't come out of the middle, the bat skewed in his hands but it was out of reach of Anderson;

21.1;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run steps to leg, this one spins sharply and Clarke pushes it out to deep cover;
20.6;?;Broad to Starc, no run out with a hit! Awful throw from Jason Roy, the sub. Starc pushed it to mid-on, came racing down for a single and had no chance of getting back. Roy's throw is just a lob towards the keeper, except Prior wasn't up to the stumps;
20.5;?;Broad to Starc, no run that was a sharp bumper, well it looked sharp - speedgun said 82mph...beats Starc again as he tries to hook;

 Innings Start
8.00pm The Australians get their medals. Michael Clarke introduced last , gets a few boos. That's not good. Clarke should get a lot respect. "At the end of the day we are here to try and win. Credit to England, they played really well today. We are outplayed throughout the series, we thought we were a chance. Our bowlers have been exceptional. I certainly can't complain about the whole squad."
Nearly there, folks. Now come the England for their medals. Alastair Cook comes up last. Moments away from lifting the urn. First a word: "It would have been nice to finish the game off, rules are there for a reason. It was pretty dark. Umpires have strict guidelines. Fair play to Australia for pushing the game on. Our job was to make Australia's task as tough as possible. I thought the way we controlled that run chase was fantastic. A word on the crowd, we've had amazing support. I'm also very privileged to captain these guys."
The champagne is already flowing...Alastair Cook lifts the urn. The fireworks go off. It will be a long night for the England players.
Well, that just about wraps things up for the Ashes series. But you haven't got long to wait before the next one. November 21 in Brisbane we go again. Before that, though, plenty more cricket coming up starting with the Twenty20s in a few days time then the five match ODI contest. For now, though, from Gnasher, Alex, Alan and everyone else who has brought you the coverage of this series thanks for joining us and goodbye for now.
7.50pm The players are coming down the steps now for the formalities (warning: they can take a while)
Starts with medals to umpires. They get booed but Aleem Dar responds by waving to the crowd.
Man of the match goes to Shane Watson: "It was an exciting finish. The light came to rescue us in some sort of way. We wanted to set something they had a chance of chasing. It didn't work out for us, but the crowd got something to see."
Craig: "@Jerry: If England needed a draw to retain the Ashes and were bowling, would the ICC rules still be stupid? Craig - England fan."
Phil: "momentum with england? Did anyone else notice that Australia declared twice in this match, and that without those declarations, this match wouldve peetered out long ago?"
No surprises for England's player of the series: Ian Bell and he also wins the Compton-Miller medal. "On a personal note it was nice to contribute. Going into the series I was probably low on a few runs. [Looking back to 2005] I don't think I was very good back then."
Australia's player of the series: Ryan Harris "I wanted to play five Tests, I ended up playing four. My aim was to not go home early. The result didn't go our way, we'll see what happens at home."
7.45pm Bob: "So I think that puts England back on the front foot when the Aussies were looking like momentum was moving their way. Test cricket - bloody hell!"
Keith Bennett: "England won 3-0, nearly 4-0, despite losing on first innings 4-0."
Nick: "bloody atrocious end to the match (and this coming from an aussie!). not the umpires' faults though, just the ICC and their officious mania for making rules in dowtown Dubai that take decisions away from the on-field officials."
Jerry: "The ICC rules on light are stupid. A 20/20 would still be going."
Swati: "The light was really bad, the fielders were hardly able to see the ball, you can say ODI, 20/20 will be going on now without issues, but that's because of the white ball!"
robert gilliland: "not sure any english fan can complain, the only reason there was a match was because clarke created one. As for the light, the English were playing for light on day 4 of the 3rd test with a full day to go. Great day of cricket and just end to a strange series"
I'll stay around to bring you the presentation shortly.
7.40pm Plenty of hugs, slaps on the back and smiles in the England dressing room. There's a camera in there, too. Now the Aussies come over to shake hands. A hard-fought series which occasionally got a little edgy. We'll all be doing it again in two months. Phew. "It's an incredible feeling and hard to put into words," says James Anderson. "We won't be leaving the dressing room for a while."
Alastair Cook now comes down The Oval steps to cheers from the crowd who have started to calm down after the light decision. "I was thinking I haven't played one-day cricket for a while," says Matt Prior.
KP: "We have to give it a go today, we'd lost a day to rain. That's the brand of cricket this team plays." Well, some made dispute that.
Now this getting feisty. Clarke into the umpires about the light. That didn't look too good. They are going off! It's all over. Oh boy, in some way it is fitting that the umpires are at the centre of it all as this Ashes series ends. They had to be fair to both teams, but is this good for cricket? The umpires are doing what they are told. It's just a good job that the Ashes wasn't on the line. Credit to both teams for the way they played today, was fantastic Test cricket until the light faded. A little ironic, though, that it was Australia so keen to leave the pitch at the end. Anyone fancy speaking to James Faulkner tonight?
