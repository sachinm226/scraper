1610hrs Once again the game seems to have slipped away from Pakistan in the last 10 overs. From 6 for 190 in 40, Australia have scored 8 for 277. A crazy little cameo from Hauritz - 53 off 39 balls, and a typical one-day knock from Hussey have led the recovery for Australia. Join us in half an hour to see how Pakistan do with the chase
49.6;2;Mohammad Asif to Hauritz, 2 runs short ball again, this isn't that high, and Hauritz makes room and goes over backward point, doesn't get enough power in it but comes back for two;
49.5;?;Mohammad Asif to Hauritz, no run good bouncer, follows the backing-away Hauritz, cleverly bowled;
49.4;W;Mohammad Asif to Harris, OUT slower ball, wide of him as he backs away, creating enough distance, and it spoons off the top edge to extra cover where Afridi takes the dolly;Ryan Harris c Shahid Afridi b Mohammad Asif 4 (2m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 133.33;
49.3;2;Mohammad Asif to Harris, 2 runs pulls, mis-times, which means it hasn't gone fast enough to the fielder, and they come back for two;
49.2;2;Mohammad Asif to Harris, 2 runs full delivery outside off,d riven down to wide of long-off for two;
49.1;1;Mohammad Asif to Hauritz, 1 run swipes this one across the line, gets one;
48.6;W;Ajmal to Hussey, OUT leading edge and he is gone! looks to work it to leg for a single and the ball turns enough to take the front edge. Smartly, though, they don't cross even as the ball lobs to cover. As a result, Hauritz keeps strike;Michael Hussey c Mohammad Yousuf b Saeed Ajmal 67 (115m 75b 4x4 0x6) SR: 89.33;
48.5;4;Ajmal to Hussey, FOUR runs short and flat, and he has swept it for four, bisecting the two deep fielders on the on side, all his boundaries have been like this, not big shot but smart placement;
48.4;2;Ajmal to Hussey, 2 runs top-edges the sweep, and because he hasn't got enough on it, it bounces in front of deep square and comes back for two. Cruel game for the bowlers;
48.3;?;Ajmal to Hussey, no run misses the big sweep, and the topspinner misses the off stump not by much;
48.2;1;Ajmal to Hauritz, 1 run what a 50 for Hauritz, steps out again, Hauritz bowls flat, gets a single to midwicket;
48.1;6;Ajmal to Hauritz, SIX runs ho ho ho, this time he clears the longer boundary at the midwicket edge, comes down the track, maintains enough distance so that he can get under it and launches it across the line;
35.6;2;Iftikhar to Hopes, 2 runs the first real misfield of the day, comes from Yousuf who is put under pressure at mid-on by Hopes who charges through for the single. The misfield eventually gives them two;
35.5;?;Iftikhar to Hopes, no run fuller, gets onto the front foot, and drives to mid-on;
35.4;?;Iftikhar to Hopes, no run back of a length, around off again, and pushed to midwicket, staying at the crease so far;

35.2;?;Iftikhar to Hopes, no run outside off, left alone;
35.1;4;Iftikhar to Hopes, FOUR runs and what timing right away, he has not much more than met it on his pads, just a slight flick and it goes past flying across the outfield, past mid-on;
34.6;?;Ajmal to Hussey, no run topspinner, hurries Hussey into the cut, can't get it past point;
34.5;W;Ajmal to White, OUT White has perished - never really looked in actually, makes room, goes for the inside-out shot, but lofts it much too straight and Asif at three-quarters long-off moves well, judges well, holds it well behind his body, and is helped by the ball sticking to the tip of his fingers;Cameron White c Mohammad Asif b Saeed Ajmal 44 (75m 63b 3x4 1x6) SR: 69.84;

47.4;?;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, no run gets the yorker right this time, dot back to the bowler;
47.3;6;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, SIX runs this is even bigger, Hauritz is playing a ripper, slower ball, and he gets under it and gives it the full whammy, rows behind long-on;
47.2;6;Naved-ul-Hasan to Hauritz, SIX runs superb timing from Hauritz, he is playing a nice little cameo here, Rana follows him as he makes room, it's not much more than a chip shot to this fulltoss, and it clears long-on;

46.6;2;Ajmal to Hauritz, 2 runs chips this fulltoss down the ground, gets two;
46.5;?;Ajmal to Hauritz, no run another big swing, another big miss, well bowled Ajmal;

46.3;1;Ajmal to Hussey, 1 run swept away fine, but straight towards fine leg;
46.2;1;Ajmal to Hauritz, 1 run slog sweep this time, is mis-hit, but lands just short of deep square leg;

33.1;?;Iftikhar to Hussey, no run length ball, stays back to it and defends;
32.6;?;Ajmal to White, no run quicker one, 110ks, and deadly accurate too, White does well to defend it back;

32.4;1;Ajmal to Hussey, 1 run short and wide, and cut away for a single;

Rao Iftikhar replaces Rana now
 Innings Start
Australia continue to be on a roll. Check this out: since the Ashes last year, they have lost just three ODIs and have won series against England, India and Pakistan, and also the Champions Trophy. And those three losses were a dead rubber, a Dhoni special, and an unsuccessful defence in the Delhi evening dew. Pakistan, well, they will want to somehow win something before they leave; they have only two chances left. One of them will come on Sunday, the last match of the series. But before that, on Saturday young boys from both countries will play the Under-19 World Cup final at the picturesque Bert Sutcliffe Oval in the outskirts of Christchurch. We will bring that live too. Thanks for joining us today, okay bye
37.5;W;Harris to Iftikhar, OUT Ten wickets in two matches for Harris, and has he worked this one out beautifully or what? Four short deliveries, tucking him up, getting a short leg in, keeping him in the crease, and then sucker punch, full and wide, and the edge flies to right of Haddin who dives and takes it single-handed. No. 5 for Haddin too. I think Waqar Younis holds the record for most back-to-back five-fors in ODIs, he got three. Harris has got two;Iftikhar Anjum c ?Haddin b Harris 5 (34m 24b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20.83;
