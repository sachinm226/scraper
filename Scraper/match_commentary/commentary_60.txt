Data
Innings break Australia make an impressive score in the end. They were 5 for 140 but Maxwell and Carey shared a 134-run stand to dig them out of a hole. Maxwell had a lot of luck but he played some superb shots as well. He ended up two short of a century. He now has five scores in the 90s in ODI cricket but just one century. Carey did a great job in support. Pakistan will rue several missed chances and Shinwari's wicket off a no-ball. They could have been chasing less than 250. Now 278 looks a big ask on this slow low surface. Liam Brickhill will be back in about 30 minutes to take you through the start of the chase.
Tahir: "Pak fielders did their best that Maxwell scores century today but he fell just short"
Abdul waseh: "Maxwell three times bat in this series and three times runout.#unluckymaxwell"
Omer Manzoor: "Pakistan has gathered plenty of raw material for World Cup; unfortunately, that is not going to help their cause a lot. You need refined material for such tournaments, not the one requiring polishing "

24.4;?;Yasir Shah to Maxwell, no run is this a missed chance? Yes! Maxwell backs away to cut off the stumps, but he gets a thin edge. Rizwan took his eye off it behind the stumps, perhaps expecting that it would hit the stumps. The ball bounces out of his gloves, and Maxwell survives;

22.1;W;Yasir Shah to Stoinis, OUT bowled by a googly! Pitched up and straight. Stoinis is expecting the legbreak, and plays down the wrong line. The ball doesn't turn big, but it's enough to beat him, zipping through the gate to hit the stumps;Marcus Stoinis b Yasir Shah 2 (3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;

Ketan: "Pakistan will be a big force at the World Cup when they have a full strength side to pick from, also conditions in England will suit Pakistani players also, let's not be fooled by these recent slump by Pakistan. Your thoughts Alex?" I think they will play well in England. They were superb in 2017 winning the Champions Trophy.
 Innings Start

11.00pm A bizarre chase from Pakistan. Perhaps it was the inexperience in their ranks? It's the fourth time in history that a side has lost an ODI chase with two centurions. Pakistan were cruising when Abid Ali and Mohammad Rizwan were in the midst of their 144-run stand, but when Abid fell after reaching his ton, Australia had their opening. The required rate climbed, Australia found their way back into the game, and now they've made it 4-0. That 134-run stand between Maxwell and Carey set up Australia's total, and their doggedness in the field turned it into a match-winning one.
Rehan Javed: "One of most frustrated Defeats in history of cricket; Once again Pakistan took defeat from Jaws of victory."
Sadiq Dars: "This is hard to believe 25 required on 18 balls with 6 wickets in hand and finally Pakistan lost.."
Binoy: "Finch the captain cool done it again for aussies."
Mikrant: "Inexperience just cost them the match."
Glenn Maxwell is the Player of the Match: "We lost a few up top and I came in a bit earlier, but to put on a good partnership with Carey was what we needed. I've got a really solid role in this team at the moment. We knew if we could just get a wicket and break their big partnership, it was a hard wicket to start on."
"They bowled beautifully," admits Imad Wasim. "We were lacking the power hitting. We were short, so it shows we were lacking something. Some of the shots were not on in that situation. But the hundreds were positives for us. It's an honour to lead Pakistan. I enjoy captaincy."
"I thought our composure with the ball was really good," says winning captain Aaron Finch. "We knew how slow the wicket was, we knew if we could get some new batters in it would be tough. Credit to our boys, though Abid and Rizwan getting hundreds were great knocks. Maxwell played really well, assessing the situation, taking it deep. You can never accuse Glenn of being selfish, the way he plays. He does everything for the team. When Shinwari hit a six, the heart started going again. But we kept hanging in. And that's something we've prided ourselves on. Our quicks at the end were very disciplined."
And that's all from your commentary team tonight, with Alex Malcolm and Liam Brickhill having kept you informed over the course of the game. Australia's one-day renaissance continues apace, and they will take some serious confidence into the fifth and final game on Sunday. Do join us again for that game. Until then, goodbye!

40.3;1;Lyon to Abid Ali, 1 run short third man tumbles to his left to stop a very late dab, just the single;
40.2;1;Lyon to Rizwan, 1 run Rizwan skips out and sends a drive skimming to cover, where it's stopped by Finch - but not quickly enough to stop the single;
40.1;?;Lyon to Rizwan, no run pushed back to the bowler;
39.6;?;Zampa to Abid Ali, no run three slog sweeps in a row, but he can't lay a bat on this one. Carey whips the bails off, and there's an appeal ... but it's for caught behind! The umpire says no, so Australia go upstairs for a review. But there's nothing on UltraEdge, so the decision will stand;
39.5;4;Zampa to Abid Ali, FOUR runs clears the left leg, and this time he nails the slog sweep, right into the gap;
39.4;2;Zampa to Abid Ali, 2 runs slogged up and over mid on, who is up. It's played slightly awkwardly, but lands safely. And that takes Abid to the record for highest score on debut for Pakistan, beating Saleem Elahi's record;
39.3;2;Zampa to Abid Ali, 2 runs another paddle sweep, and this one goes even finer;
39.2;1;Zampa to Rizwan, 1 run a paddle sweep gets it down to fine leg;

38.6;1;Lyon to Rizwan, 1 run Lyon offers width, but it's just a single out to the sweeper;
38.5;4;Lyon to Rizwan, FOUR runs wristed to wide long on! Rizwan uses his feet to get close to it, once again using those powerful wrists to fetch the ball powerfully into the leg side. It's perfectly placed too;
38.4;?;Lyon to Rizwan, no run tapped back to the bowler;
38.3;2;Lyon to Rizwan, 2 runs Rizwan uses strong wrists to get the ball out to deep midwicket, rushing back for a second run;

38.1;1;Lyon to Abid Ali, 1 run there it is! A hundred on debut for Abid Ali. He's playing his first international at 31, and he wasn't even supposed to be playing today. And now he's become the third Pakistani to score a hundred on his ODI debut;
37.6;?;Zampa to Rizwan, no run Rizwan jumps down the track, but Zampa adjusts his length and he can only defend;
37.5;?;Zampa to Rizwan, no run legbreak, flat on off stump, the ball taking the inside edge of a defensive push;

37.2;?;Zampa to Abid Ali, no run pushed through by Zampa, and Abid misses the ball as he flicks across his front pad. It looked like it might be headed down the leg side, and Umpire Dharmasena turns the appeal down. Australia reckon he's out - or at least hope so - and they ask for a review. Two reds and an umpire's call on the ball tracker! So Abid survives, on 98;
37.1;1;Zampa to Rizwan, 1 run there's the sweep again, and he connects well but the fielder is in position to stop it - and this is now Pakistan's highest third wicket ODI stand against Australia;

36.5;4;Lyon to Rizwan, FOUR runs another sweep, and he lays a good chunk of bat on this one and places it nicely behind square to collect another boundary and push Pakistan forward;
36.4;?;Lyon to Rizwan, no run beaten on the slog sweep and Carey has the bails off in a flash. It doesn't look like his back foot left the crease, and Rizwan rolls onto his back to have a stretch after missing the shot. A spot of cramp, perhaps? But he's good to go;
36.3;1;Lyon to Abid Ali, 1 run tapped close in on the leg side but into the gap, and they run a quick single;
36.2;?;Lyon to Abid Ali, no run rushing straight on with the arm, Abid reading it and pushing to cover;

34.6;1;Coulter-Nile to Abid Ali, 1 run almost run out by a Maxwell direct hit! He dabbed it to point and point and took off, Maxwell swooped to his right, wrong man to take on, he fired at the non-striker's and just missed! Abid was short of his ground as he dived;
34.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Rizwan, 1 run back of a length outside off, he runs this to third man;
34.4;4;Coulter-Nile to Rizwan, FOUR runs this pull shot makes the rope! This was shorter but it was only chest high, he swivelled and hammered it behind square and it raced to the rope;
34.3;2;Coulter-Nile to Rizwan, 2 runs cracking pull shot off the front foot wide of mid on, who is in the circle, but it slows up on the outfield because of the dew;

34.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Rizwan, no run fuller on off, he defends on the front foot to cover;

32.5;4;Coulter-Nile to Abid Ali, FOUR runs edged and it flies wide of Carey! This was a good delivery, tempting the drive but it was not that full, a genuine outside edge and it's well wide of the diving keeper and races to the fine third man rope!;
32.4;2;Coulter-Nile to Abid Ali, 2 runs short length and he cracks a pull shot forward of square this time for two more;
32.3;2;Coulter-Nile to Abid Ali, 2 runs back of a length on off, he flicks this superbly with the bottom hand behind square and Lyon has to make a diving save in the deep;
