Shane Watson, Australia allrounder: Taken me a little while to get going. In the end we have been getting close to 300 each and every game so we are giving ourselves the best chance of winning each game. Things fell well together with George in the middle today. That's my game i suppose. The wicket was a bit slow so I had to try and get into the innings with a few runs under my belt. A little slower than Jaipur, but the ground has a very fast outfield. The two new white balls certainly help with these big scores. Hopefully we put in a better performance tonight. We thought it was enough in Jaipur (when asked about whether the score is a winning one), so we will just do our best to bring this home without another good performance.
Another India-Australia ODI, Another big run fest. Australia put on 350 for 6 and India will be feeling under the pump as their batsmen are yet again set a tall order to complete. George Bailey was simply terrific today, as he has been throughout the series, and put on his highest ODI score of 156. He was ably supported by Shane Watson's 102. India started well with the ball, keeping Australia to just 89 for 2 after 22 overs, but since then Australia added 261 runs in 28 overs at a rate of 9.32, which simply took the innings away from India. Can India repeat the Jaipur heist and pull off yet another high-scoring chase? That answer and more in just 40 minutes time.

49.4;W;Jadeja to Johnson, OUT fuller length ball just outside off which Johnson gets down on one knee to slog, but finds Dhawan stationed at deep midwicket. Will the umpires check the front foot no-ball too? Looks like the umpires will have spared him the embarrassment just for now.

49.3;1nb;Jadeja to Voges, (no ball) and would you believe it, Voges goes too.

And would you seriously believe it. Jadeja has over-stepped YET again. It will be a free-hit for Australia, and Voges is trudging back, almost in disbelief. Dhoni must be infuriated under those awesome glasses of his.;

19.4;?;Mishra to Watson, no run how did this miss the off stump! It was flatter this time and it turned past the batsman's bat, and somehow missed the off stick;
19.3;4;Mishra to Watson, FOUR runs this outfield is too quick, the batsman takes a step down the pitch and slices the tossed up delivery to deep extra cover, without any timing, but the ball still beats the fielder to the boundary;

16.4;1nb;Jadeja to Watson, (no ball) 92 kph, Watson, looking to go over midwicket, ends up spooning this up through mid off, with Rohit Sharma taking a straight forward catch. But hang on. Looks like the umpire has called back Watson to the wicket as they refer the decision to third umpire. And the news all of India don't want to hear has just occurred as it looks as if he did in fact go over just slightly. So it's a front foot no-ball, and a free hit for the Australian batsmen. Tough times indeed;

 Innings Start
Well it's all done and dusted then. After six matches (which included a rain out in Ranchi and an even more rained-out match in Cuttack (which got called off)) the series is levelled at 2-2, with the final match in Bangalore to decide the series. With four centuries in the match, it was certainly a more memorable counter between these two sides. So now its off to Bangalore for the November 2 decider. On behalf of Devashish Fuloria and the scorers, this is Rohan Sharma saying good night, and good luck.
Virat Kohli, Man of the Match: That was the plan I guess (when asked about going about the chase), with Rohit and Shikhar setting the platform. Shikhar was getting a bit of cramp and it was important that one of us went through to the end. I took some risks early on to attack the bowlers. I thought I should let Shikhar bat through, and then once he got out, I thought I should finish the game. When Mitch came back on to have a bowl, it helped to have MS at the other end. He told me that we had wickets and we need to go after him. I then went after him and it was all a calculated risk. I had confidence in my ability and backed myself. I like bating under lights, as I have said before, and if you have a target on board its always easy to analyse how many runs you need and how to go about it. Yeah I can't wait to play in Bangalore. Bangalore has always been a great wicket for both the batsmen and bowlers. With both teams levelled at 2-2, its exciting that the series is going down to the wire in the final match.
MS Dhoni, India captain: I think its something we need to think about (about the fact that so many high run chases have been achieved of late). Is 350 the new 280, 290 or 300? With the new bowlers they are mostly getting smashed. Even the fast bowlers are bowling with their third man up and fine leg up. Not sure where its going but if we are chasing like this it is not going to be good for the long-term health of the game. Only seeing boundaries and sixes for seven hours? We knew a bit of dew will come later, and now it is slightly easy as we can break down the game at intervals. We can evaluate after the 30-over mark as to what we need to do and what we can achieve. We were evenly placed. I think Shikhar and Rohit batted really well, and Shikhar got a century, but for Rohit it was one of those days when you can't find the gaps and he absorbed the pressure so well. Yes I think Virat was brilliant, the reason being that as the ball got old he was counterattacking and maintaining a good position when going for the big shots. He made it look easy and the way he took pressure off the batsmen was amazing. Its always about taking the pressure off the new batsman. Bangalore is known for its big runs so not sure how much we will need to chase or how much we have to set to chase over there.
George Bailey, Australia captain: It is disappointing (that we lost). Virat played an unbelievable knock. Still a beautiful batting wicket so you dont see many batters complaining about it. We needed to find early breakthroughs. You can always do things differently, that never changes, win or lose, but we fought our way back into the game really well. We made them hit really good shots and when a guy is batting well that is all you can do. (When asked about the fact he has scored the highest by an Australian against India) But we are losing mate. If you are a spectator you will be loving this (high-scoring matches) so we are really looking forward to Bangalore.
Now quotes from the match presentation
Shikhar Dhawan, India opening batsman: Yeah we batted really well. It was a big target. Wicket was a bit slow today but we stayed at the wicket and we kept rotating the strike and getting boundaries. I just wanted to keep the wickets in our hands and get a good run rate and play our shots and not play any different shots, so thats what we did. Not overexcited (after getting his hundred) but just played a bad shot. I should have stayed at the wicket and finish it off for the team. Hopefully next time I can do that and bring victory to my team and the dressing room.
Rohit Sharma, India opening batsman: It was a little slower than we expected (the pitch). The ball was not coming on initially, but we knew with the dew 350 was possible so we didn't want tt lose our wickets. Yeah we complement each other really well (Dhawan and him), both on and off the field. its coming off really well and giving a good start was really important. I am glad that both of us are managing to do it. This is just the start and we need to keep doing this. and we hope its the start of a good opening partnership for the both of us. Dhawan was hitting the ball really well so my job was to rotate the strike, give him as many balls, and allow him the strike.
This has simply been a batsmen's day. When you have 701 runs scored for just the loss of 10 wickets, it is all you need to infer. It began with Shane Watson slamming the Indian bowlers to get the early initiative, with George Bailey adding the cherry on top with his 156 that looked to have batted India out of the game. With 351 to chase, India needed to look back to Jaipur, and how. Beginning with an integral 178-run opening stand between Rohit and Dhawan, with Dhawan going on to register his fourth ODI century of this year. Then Kohli entered, and he was simply in magnificent form as he dictated terms from the outset, and careened the bowling on the way to his 17th ODI hundred. Simply superb stuff from the Indians, and the Australians will feel hard done as they have given up yet another 350-run score, and that too in similar style. Stayed tuned for more reactions from the players and the post-match presentation.
49.3;2;Faulkner to Dhoni, 2 runs 137 kph, Dhoni guides this through mid off, with mid off making a hash of it as it deflects towards long on, with the pair running the extra run to get the victory. It sets off delirious scenes from the Nagpur crowd as they roar in approval to what has been a sublime batting performance from the young turks of Indian cricket.;
49.2;4;Faulkner to Dhoni, FOUR runs 136 kph, low full toss outside off as Dhoni flashes hard and is able to pierce the gap between cover and backward point, with cover diving fully to his right in vain to try and stop this bullet off the bat;

47.5;1;Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run length ball which Kohli plays to cover to get a single and get off the strike;
47.4;4;Faulkner to Kohli, FOUR runs 141 kph, take a bow Kohli. Is there a better man when it comes to chasing huge ODI totals? The crowd go bananas as Kohli glides this through third man for the third consecutive boundary of the over to bring up his 17th ODI hundred. Sterling stuff from this Indian batsman;
47.3;4;Faulkner to Kohli, FOUR runs 136 kph, he is simply topping himself at each instance. Kohli uses his strong wrists to on drive this fuller length so sweelty, and generate so much power that it dissects the two boundary riders to the midwicket boundary;

44.3;1;Johnson to Dhoni, 1 run 147 kph, Dhoni gets his bat out to this fuller pitched delivery to carve this through third man for one;
44.2;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run 144 kph, Dhoni decides his best option is to just allow this through to the keeper;

42.2;W;Johnson to Raina, OUT 138 kph, short ball again as Raina struggles to get this away with a pull. Doesn't seem to be a deflection, but the umpire has signalled he is out, which is not surprising for those in the know (Raina + short ball = trouble).

40.4;4;Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs 149 kph, you know what they say, fortune favours the brave. Kohli, going for a slash over the covers, instead gets an outside edge which beats a diving Haddin to the third man boundary for the third consecutive four this over;
40.3;4;Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs 140 kph, Mitch drops it short and once again Kohli punishes him as he swivels on the back foot to pull this square off a rather 'finish' fine leg to just get to the boundary;
40.2;4;Johnson to Kohli, FOUR runs 138 kph, Kohli just dismisses this short length delivery from his presence as he rocks back to pull him through midwicket for a boundary. Kohli looking very dangerous here;

39.5;4;Faulkner to Raina, FOUR runs 136 kph, Raina able to slap away this length ball on off stump through the gap on the off side for a boundary. Australian bowlers (and batsmen) must be wondering what they will need to score in order to trouble this Indian batting line-up?;

39.3;1;Faulkner to Raina, 1 run 134 kph, length ball which Raina pushes to mid on. Finch, running in from there, picks it up and throws down the non-strikers, but Raina had dived in safely;

38.6;?;Johnson to Raina, no run 142 kph, short ball outside off as Raina goes for the pull shot, but is way too early for it, as it ends up carrying to the keeper. Raina looked out of his depth there that's for sure.;

38.4;?;Johnson to Kohli, no run 146 kph, yorker length outside off which Kohli is unable to get a bat to as it carries through to the keeper;

36.5;1;McKay to Kohli, 1 run 129 kph, length ball angling in as Kohli clips it off the pads. Raina backed up too much though as he has to return to the non-strikers, just beating the throw from short mid on. End up running the overthrow anyways;
36.4;1;McKay to Raina, 1 run 127 kph, McKay going round as he gets this to swing in outside off. Raina left quite a gap there, but is able to work this away to the leg side to get off the mark;
36.3;1;McKay to Kohli, 1 run 127 kph, length ball which Kohli pushes to long on for a single to get Raina on strike. Can Kohli make it four 50+ scores on the trot?;

36.1;2;McKay to Kohli, 2 runs 127 kph, takes this back of a length ball and turns it away to the leg side;
35.6;W;Faulkner to S Dhawan, OUT 136 kph, and its all over for Da-One. Looking to improvise a flick behind square on the leg side through fine leg, he ends up stepping out to the off side. Faulkner must have seen this coming as he releases the ball on a middle to leg stump line, which ends up castling the southpaw's wicket. So Dhawan was unable to make this century count for more, but still a fine effort considering the circumstances. Makes that the third century of the match as well.;Shikhar Dhawan b Faulkner 100 (152m 102b 11x4 0x6) SR: 98.03;

32.4;4;Doherty to Kohli, FOUR runs the bowler was forced to shorten his length, but he makes the mistake of giving Kohli room. Instead of violence he chooses finesse, guiding it fine with a late cut;
