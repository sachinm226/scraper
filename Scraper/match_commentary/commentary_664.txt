Data
This is the lowest total at Adelaide Oval since March 1992 - Well done England. Once again there is nothing to write home about, There was no intent from England's batsmen and they threw away their wickets with loose shots. Australian bowler's cashed in heavily and 111 is what they need to get when they come out to bat.
Roy from Australia sums it up. "Baffled in Brissie!!!!! - Perthetic in Perth!!!!! - "Sad" in Sydney!!!!! - "Mucked Up" in Melbourne!!!!! - "Horrible" in Hobart!!!!! - "Addled" in Adelaide!!!!!... Next?????

Good day everybody and welcome to Cricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage of the seventh - or is it the 70th - match of the Commonwealth Bank series. I'm George Binoy, Sajan Nair will join me later in the day and we bring you all the action as Australia take on England at the Adelaide Oval.
Today's big news is that Nathan Astle has announced his retirement, rode away into the sunset, you get the picture. New Zealand will have so say farewell to a champion batsman. You can read the whole story here and if you don't remember Astle's finest hours, check here out to re-visit Test cricket's fastest double hundred.
Back to the game at hand ...
Toss: England have won the toss and will bat
And here are the teams;
England 1 Andrew Strauss, 2 Mal Loye, 3 Ian Bell, 4 Ed Joyce, 5 Paul Collingwood, 6 Andrew Flintoff, 7 Paul Nixon, 8 Jamie Dalrymple, 9 Liam Plunkett, 10 Chris Tremlett, 11 Monty Panesar.
Australia 1 Adam Gilchrist (wk), 2 Matthew Hayden, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Andrew Symonds, 6 Michael Hussey, 7 Cameron White, 8 Brad Hogg, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Stuart Clark.
Australia have rested Glenn McGrath and Nathan Bracken and have given Brad Hogg an opportunity. Mitchell Johnson also returns to add fiery pace to the attack. England also have made two changes with Chris Tremlett and Liam Plunkett replacing Jon Lewis and James Anderson.
Australia have already qualified for the final. Well OK it's not mathematically certain yet but for them to miss out they have to lose every one of their games with a bonus point, and given their form and the form of the other teams, it's hard to see that happening. England have fallen a point behind New Zealand after losing with a bonus point on Tuesday. New Zealand have five points while England have four.
The umpires, Steve Davis and Ian Howell, are out on the ground as are the Australians. Brett Lee will begin proceedings from over the wicket and facing him is Andrew Strauss. Mal Loye looks on from the non-striker's end as Lee hurtles in. Two slips in place.&
 Innings Start
Australia have beaten England by nine wickets and even that doesn't put in perspective the magnitude of this victory. They've also won a bonus point in the process. Mitchell Johnson wins the Man-of-the-Match award for his searing spell of 4 for 45.
Thank you for tuning into Cricinfo's live coverage of this match. We'll be back on Sunday when Australia take on New Zealand at Perth. Do join us then. Have a good weekend. Cheers!
