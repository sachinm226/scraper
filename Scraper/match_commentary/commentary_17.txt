Andrew McGlashan will step in for the start of the chase.
3.35pm Innings break New Zealand finish with an outstanding score. At one stage it could have been 230 plus. Martin Guptill was the hero with 97 and he got great support from Kane Williamson. Jimmy Neesham played a gem. Two key overs late from Jhye Richardson and Kane Richardson have given Australia a chance to "only" chase 220.
Martin Guptill: "Nothing changed too much for me. I just went out to try and do the best I could. Luckily it came off for me today."
It was the equal most sixes ever hit by New Zealand in a T20I innings. New Zealand did lose that game though in 2018.
Robert Lamb: "Two bad calls to finish -definitely a wide to Southee and then an over waist high no ball off the last. Wonder if those will prove crucial against this powerful Aussie batting line up."
Horse: "Poor umpiring there - wide and no ball not called. "
19.6;6;Sams to Neesham, SIX runs high full toss flicked over fine leg! It was a waist high full toss at the hip, it was borderline a no-ball, Neesham flicked it with ease high over fine leg. A terrible delivery to finish. It's not a no-ball though. Sams might have got lucky off his last two balls to not have to re-bowl both;
19.5;W;Sams to Southee, OUT Southee is run out trying to pinch an extra! It was a length ball way wide of off, it should have been a wide, Southee missed it, Neesham called him through, Wade had his glove off, threw to Sams who did well to gather it and flick it onto the stumps;Tim Southee run out (?Wade/Sams) 6 (5m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200;

19.1;1w;Sams to Neesham, 1 wide wide yorker, 128kph, Neesham leaves and it's called wide. It was very tight to the guideline. Tough call;
18.6;W;Kane Richardson to Santner, OUT holes out to deep midwicket running in! Clever slower ball wide of off, Santner tried to go over wide long on but didn't read the slower ball, he got under it and hit it straight up to deep midwicket, Maxwell comes in and takes the catch easily;Mitchell Santner c Maxwell b KW Richardson 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

18.2;?;Kane Richardson to Neesham, no run dropped return catch! A tough one. Full and wide outside off, he hammered it flat back at Richardson and it just didn't stick in the hands. Crucial dot though;
18.2;1w;Kane Richardson to Neesham, 1 wide wide yorker and too wide of off. Kane Richardson debates it but it looks a decent call;
18.1;1;Kane Richardson to Conway, 1 run short wide slower ball, 117kph, he cuts firmly to deep point;
17.6;?;Jhye Richardson to Neesham, no run beats him with a brilliant wide yorker;
17.5;4;Jhye Richardson to Neesham, FOUR runs flicked behind square and Sams can't knock it back! Full toss on off, he used the bottom hand to flick it behind square, Sams got there with the dive but he didn't knock it back, it bounced off his hand onto the rope;

5.30pm Presentation
Martin Guptill is Player of the Match for his 97: "I'm a little bit cooked at the moment but it's nice to get some runs and another win. My mind has been clear. Things just haven't gone my way. It was nice to spend some time in the middle today. Getting the win is the most important thing."
Kane Williamson: "There were flashbacks there from the last time Stoinis hit a hundred. Incredible partnership from Stoinis and Sams at the end there. As we know on these sorts of grounds anything can happen and you have to be on your toes. I think it was a pretty strong performance from us across the board. But it was a very good game and it's such a small margin in T20 cricket."
Aaron Finch: "It was a great game of cricket. That partnership between Stoinis and Daniel Sams was extraordinary hitting. It was brilliant to get it back to 12 an over from 16 and a half. Trent bowled a beautiful over which halted our momentum. All in all a great game to be a part of. It would have been good to be on the winning side of it though. I thought that we didn't bowl too badly today. Gup played a brilliant innings. There was some brilliant hitting batting on both sides."
New Zealand win by 4 runs. What an amazing game of cricket. Australia looked dead and buried when Mitchell Santner took three wickets in an over. But Marcus Stoinis and Daniel Sams produced some of the best hitting you will ever see. They made 92 off 37 deliveries and save for a couple of miscues at the end they nearly pulled it off. The partnership was the highest 7th wicket stand in T20I history.
