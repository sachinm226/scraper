Data
Disappointing performance from Bangladesh batsmen once again and they have been skidded out to a paltry 124 runs. Saleh and Bashar got to decent starts but got out playing reckless shots. Hogg once again finished with a 3-wicket haul and all the bowlers came up with good performance. Please join us for the chase.
