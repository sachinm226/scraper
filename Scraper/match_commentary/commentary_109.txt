Data
So, take a bow, Dean Elgar! He carries his bat for the second time this season, and incredibly the third time this year, after previous efforts against England and India. And though the innings ended with indecent haste, that ninth wicket stand between Elgar and Rabada has given South Africa a total of definite substance, given the quality of their attack and the apparent life in the wicket.
Right, that's an opportune moment for me to hand over. Alan Gardner will see you through the start of the Australia innings
Vaughan: "2 world records equalled on the same ball - Elgar carrying his bat for a 3rd time (level with Haynes) and Smith 5 catches in an innings"

97.4;?;Lyon to Morkel, no run width outside off stump, and left alone;

96.6;?;Hazlewood to Elgar, no run nip off the deck on a middle-and-leg line, flicks the pad and flies out to point;
96.5;4;Hazlewood to Elgar, FOUR runs bang! That's an awesome bit of biffing! Meeting the fuller length with an utterly out-of-character thump through the line! Holding the pose and dumping the ball right to the brink of the rope;
96.4;?;Hazlewood to Elgar, no run turned inside out this time by a better-directed short ball, aimed right at the ribcage;
96.3;1;Hazlewood to Rabada, 1 run short, pulled, safe! Rabada is making his own luck with his aggressive intent, I reckon. Another shovelled pull, a spiralling top-edge, but lands safe at fine leg;

96.1;1;Hazlewood to Elgar, 1 run poked into the on side, calm and composed;

95.4;?;Cummins to Rabada, no run fuller length, still a fraction short, but it draws a loose poke as Rabada follows the angle outside off. Better from Australia;
95.3;?;Cummins to Rabada, no run short once more, Rabada ducks without a care in the world;
95.2;?;Cummins to Rabada, no run short again, Rabada is pre-empting the bouncer now, and walks inside the line in an attempt to deflect it very fine. Misses out;
95.1;?;Cummins to Rabada, no run another fizzing bouncer, can't connect with a flinched pull;
94.6;?;Hazlewood to Elgar, no run more pace, whistling through to the keeper. Australia have been good this morning, but South Africa have been better;
94.5;?;Hazlewood to Elgar, no run solidly blocked on the back foot;
94.4;2;Hazlewood to Elgar, 2 runs clipped out to deep midwicket, and up comes the 300. South Africa have righted the wrongs of their afternoon session;
94.3;?;Hazlewood to Elgar, no run squeezed defence, into the leg side, hopping into line;
94.2;1;Hazlewood to Rabada, 1 run another swishing pull, to backward square. Rabada is playing a blinder here, taking on the short ball and backing himself to connect more often than not;
94.1;4;Hazlewood to Rabada, FOUR runs top strike! Fuller this time from Hazlewood, but right into the slot for a measured drive through mid-off. Tasty batting;
35.6;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run cramped for room on an ambitious back-foot drive, but middles it well enough to be fielded at cover. AB has a mood on, sit tight!;

34.5;?;Hazlewood to Elgar, no run slapped to point and dropped! Nathan Lyon, saw it all the way in, but it hit the heel of his hand and burst through. Elgar was done in by the extra bounce, and couldn't keep his stroke down. Big let-off!;

92.1;?;Hazlewood to Rabada, no run behind the line, pushed to cover;
91.6;4;Cummins to Elgar, FOUR runs wallop! Dismissive thump across the line, another short ball, but Elgar was waiting for it this time on the back foot, cracking it in front of square with a de Villiers flourish! That's his highest Test score against Australia;

83.5;W;Starc to Maharaj, OUT oh dear, that's a shocker... SA lose their eighth as Maharaj flubs a catch to extra cover! Brain scrambled by reverse swing and pace? Maybe... Hands hard and foot nowhere near the ball? Certainly. That's a rubbish way to go any time, but particularly when you're team is on the slide and hanging on for the close with a centurion at the other end;Keshav Maharaj c Bancroft b Starc 3 (7m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85;

63.6;?;Starc to Elgar, no run very full, speared into the toes;
63.5;2;Starc to Elgar, 2 runs up onto the toes, and that's excellently played, down through third man, turning what looked like an awkward lifter into an excellent run-scoring deflection. Good dive on the rope to save the boundary;
63.4;2;Starc to Elgar, 2 runs picks the gap in the covers with a well-timed punch, avoiding point but inside of cover. Nurdling of the highest order;
63.3;1;Starc to du Plessis, 1 run flicked behind square to get off the mark;
63.2;1;Starc to Elgar, 1 run tailing into the left-hander, there's suddenly reverse swing on display;
63.1;4b;Starc to Elgar, 4 byes a horrible leg-side swinger, no stopping that for Paine, and no wide either. Very harsh...;
62.6;?;Cummins to du Plessis, no run outside off, a hint of outswing, fenced to the off side;
62.5;W;Cummins to de Villiers, OUT in the air and gone! Newlands is stunned into semi-silence... a full length, AB strides onto the front foot and rather yorks what should have been a half-volley, getting through the shot too soon and rifling a simple chance to Warner at mid-off. What a let-down for the crowd, what a let-off for Australia!;AB de Villiers c Warner b Cummins 64 (136m 95b 10x4 0x6) SR: 67.36;
62.4;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run poked to cover off the back foot;
62.3;1;Cummins to Elgar, 1 run very full, wide line, a bottom-hand flog out to point. Very Graeme Smith. All the Grae(ha)mes are coming to the party now;
62.2;?;Cummins to Elgar, no run through to the keeper with extra nip off a good length;
62.1;?;Cummins to Elgar, no run outside off from round the wicket, a hop across the crease to leave alone;
61.6;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run a bottom-handed biff into the leg-side, very Gooch-esque in fact, solid base and a big wind-up, but can't beat mid-on;
61.5;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run clumped back to the bowler;
61.4;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run sliding down the leg side;
61.3;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run that's a powerful clip off the toes, but Hazlewood stands his ground at midwicket;
61.2;4;Starc to de Villiers, FOUR runs a squirty edge through third man! They all count. This time beaten on the angle back into the stumps, but soft hands prevent the edge from flying up into the cordon;
61.1;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run full face of the bat in defence;
60.6;4;Hazlewood to Elgar, FOUR runs on the back foot, hauled out through midwicket, just picking the ball up as if it was thumbing a lift, and placing it at its destination. Cheers mate, much obliged...;

60.4;1lb;Hazlewood to de Villiers, 1 leg bye clipped off the pads, out through fine leg;

60.2;?;Hazlewood to de Villiers, no run left alone;
60.1;4;Hazlewood to de Villiers, FOUR runs just stunning poise and timing! A half-volley maybe, but what a response. The full face of the bat, no followthrough whatsoever, just rattling speed off the face of the bat through long-off;
59.6;3;Starc to de Villiers, 3 runs driven on the up out through midwicket, he's stood tall to that length all day, and finds the gap once more;
59.5;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run outside off once more, angling in but there's no real shape on this old ball today. Left alone with ease;
59.4;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run full length, wide line, no stroke this time;
59.3;1;Starc to Elgar, 1 run tailing into the pads, squirted into the leg side;

59.1;?;Starc to Elgar, no run full length, outside off, an angled stab into the covers;
58.6;4;Hazlewood to de Villiers, FOUR runs back of a length, and that's a dismissive flick off the hips! Up comes the half-century with a filleted four through backward square. The ball wasn't especially leg-sided, but AB makes the angle with nimble footwork and astonishing bat speed;
58.5;?;Hazlewood to de Villiers, no run pushed onto the back foot, right behind the line of the ball;
58.4;?;Hazlewood to de Villiers, no run full length, punched on the up to the leg side;

57.5;4;Starc to Elgar, FOUR runs that's a superb way to bring up a hundred! Slightly leg-sided, but shovelled with glee through wide long-on! Ungainly as ever, but you cannot quibble with the timing of that stroke, or the commitment of the innings. Top class, and he's given Australia plenty to ponder;
57.4;1;Starc to de Villiers, 1 run driven on the up as Starc spears one into the toes, a squeeze out through fine leg;
57.3;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run very wide on the crease from round the wicket, creating a big angle back into de Villiers' stumps, who blocks with a full face;
57.3;1nb;Starc to de Villiers, (no ball) shoulders arms once more, angled into the stumps but passing harmlessly by;

56.3;?;Hazlewood to Elgar, no run banged in short, not interested in this one;
56.2;?;Hazlewood to Elgar, no run not quite there for the drive, but Elgar is lured anyway, meeting the ball a touch late but getting away with it;
56.1;?;Hazlewood to Elgar, no run round the wicket, dropped onto a probing length, pushed into the off side with solidity;
55.6;1;Starc to Elgar, 1 run down the leg side, a flick off the pads, and gathered at backward square;
55.5;4;Starc to Elgar, FOUR runs drilled through the covers! Beautiful balance, stretching onto the front foot and pounded into the gap. Quality strokeplay;
55.4;?;Starc to Elgar, no run short, and lifting sharply over Elgar's gloves as he sways out of line;
55.3;?;Starc to Elgar, no run fuller length, tighter to the top of off stump. Stout defence back down the line of the ball;
55.2;?;Starc to Elgar, no run ooh, good ball! Beautiful length, bounce and movement too, and this one bursts past a slightly startled back-foot waft outside off;
55.1;?;Starc to Elgar, no run outside off on a full length, clunked to cover;
54.6;?;Smith to de Villiers, no run flat legbreak outside off and driven towards point going back - which takes us to tea with SA looking pretty comfortably placed;
54.5;?;Smith to de Villiers, no run oh, has he slipped one through...? De Villiers seemed to play around a legbreak, it hit him on the back thigh, so maybe height a question; no review off his own bowling from Smith;
54.4;?;Smith to de Villiers, no run full and flighted, tapped to extra cover;
54.3;?;Smith to de Villiers, no run fullish, coming out quite nicely for Smithy, dinked back to the bowler;

53.6;4;Marsh to Elgar, FOUR runs round the wicket, full outside off and Elgar throws the hands, slashes a thick edge beyond the reach of second slip! And the ball flies for four, to rub it in! Smith looks aghast - he made a great, leaping effort but couldn't get a hand on it;
53.5;3;Marsh to de Villiers, 3 runs pitched up and drilled through cover, releases the shackles after some tight bowling, David Warner hurtles after it and does terrifically well to prevent a boundary;
53.4;?;Marsh to de Villiers, no run good length, 124kph on fourth/fifth stump and ABdV gets on to the front foot, dabs the ball late down into the off side;
53.3;?;Marsh to de Villiers, no run touch shorter and punched towards extra cover off the back foot;

Leg theory now... Short leg and leg gully in place
 Innings Start
10.45am: Job done by South Africa, just a couple of boundaries conceded against Hazlewood's frisky swishing. But how significant will that lead be? We know from the history of Cape Town (and, specifically, these two teams) that a duff third innings can be more significant that a below-par second.
Meanwhile, CA chief executive James Sutherland has delivered a statement on the crowd issues at Newlands: "We are extremely disappointed that a small number of fans have directed such offensive and inappropriate behavour towards our players and members of their families. Our Chairman David Peever, who is in Cape Town, has taken the matter up directly with relevant CSA officials, including President, Chris Nenzani.
"We acknowledge that CSA is taking steps to ensure incidents like those yesterday are not repeated and we have encouraged the strongest possible action in response to such behaviour. People who behave in such a manner should not be welcome at cricket grounds anywhere in the world, and together with the ICC and all member countries, we strongly endorse a zero-tolerance approach to anti-social behaviour by fans."
69.5;W;Rabada to Hazlewood, OUT got him, steered to first slip! Hazlewood gives Rabada a fourth with a rather deferential fiddle, nicked to slip - and off they go, South Africa taking a handy 56-run lead on first innings (although it could have been a fair bit more);Josh Hazlewood c Amla b Rabada 10 (26m 14b 2x4 0x6) SR: 71.42;
69.4;1;Rabada to Paine, 1 run more short stuff and Paine hooks in the air, bounces out towards deep square leg;
69.3;1;Rabada to Hazlewood, 1 run banged in short at the body, again Hazlewood plays the cheeky ramp, just one to third man this time;
69.2;?;Rabada to Hazlewood, no run fires in the yorker, but Hazlewood is equal to it! This was full and straight at 143kph, but he gets the bat down and Gandalfs it - "You shall not pass!" - in front of the stumps;
69.1;?;Rabada to Hazlewood, no run short, 141kph and soaring through outside off as Hazlewood swings and misses;
68.6;?;Morkel to Paine, no run good length and zipping through to the keeper as he shoulders arms this time;
68.5;?;Morkel to Paine, no run oh yeah, that's a beauty, fuller and curving away from the rough side, beats the outside edge as Paine feels for it;
68.4;?;Morkel to Paine, no run climbing through, 131kph as Morne starts off a touch ginger, no stroke;
68.3;?;Morkel to Paine, no run back of a length, again wide enough for Paine to come across and leave;
68.2;?;Morkel to Paine, no run slightly short in the channel, left alone;
68.1;?;Morkel to Paine, no run shortish outside off, Paine swats a cut but finds deep point, they don't take the single;
67.6;4;Rabada to Hazlewood, FOUR runs short, but casually flipped over gully for four! Knew what he was doing there, rocked back and angled the bat to ramp the ball fine of deep backward point, and tweak Rabada's tail in the process;
67.5;?;Rabada to Hazlewood, no run good length, 143kph and tailing in towards the stumps, met with a solid block down the track;
67.4;?;Rabada to Hazlewood, no run pitched up, prodded into the covers coming across;
67.3;?;Rabada to Hazlewood, no run back of a length, straightening a touch outside off as Hazlewood has a dabble and misses;
67.2;4;Rabada to Hazlewood, FOUR runs dug in at the body, Hazlewood fends and gets a glove on it... and that will be four to fine leg, gets it away safely;
67.1;?;Rabada to Hazlewood, no run round the wicket, slides down the leg side, short delivery and Hazelwood can gets out of the way without drama;
66.6;?;Morkel to Paine, no run through to the keeper, as the umpires start to contemplate the light ...;
66.5;?;Morkel to Paine, no run inducker, climbs into the thigh pad as Paine shapes to leg;
66.4;?;Morkel to Paine, no run a crunching drive, on the walk, but straight to short cover. A pleasing connection but nothing to show for it;

66.2;?;Morkel to Paine, no run outside off, curling away, no stroke here;
66.1;?;Morkel to Paine, no run swing on a full length, well watched onto the middle of the bat and clipped to mid-on;
65.6;?;Rabada to Hazlewood, no run dabbed to point off the back foot. Solid defence from the No.11. Australia keep their end up;

65.4;1;Rabada to Paine, 1 run dead-batted into the leg side, and this time they take the single. Two balls for Hazlewood to see off...;
65.3;?;Rabada to Paine, no run outside off, no stroke this time;

64.4;1;Morkel to Hazlewood, 1 run nudged to mid-off to get off the mark;

64.2;?;Morkel to Paine, no run well bowled, jagging back on the angle, and grazing past the off stump;
64.1;W;Morkel to Lyon, OUT slashed in the air ... Elgar back-pedals at point ... and takes the catch! Superbly judged, at full stretch, and what a brilliant cameo that was. Lyon deserved a maiden fifty, but kept attacking to the bitter end;Nathan Lyon c Elgar b Morkel 47 (58m 38b 8x4 0x6) SR: 123.68;
63.6;?;Maharaj to Paine, no run pushed firmly, on the up, back to the bowler;
63.5;?;Maharaj to Paine, no run big stride to defend, head over the ball;

63.1;?;Maharaj to Paine, no run forward and pushed to cover;
62.6;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run a massive mow through the line! But Morkel jags this one back over the top of the stumps. A maiden fifty is on the cards for Lyon, and he knows how he wants to get there!;
62.5;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run too much room this time, and misses with another wipe through the off side;
62.4;4;Morkel to Lyon, FOUR runs clears the front leg, and battered over the covers! Lyon is flying! Watched the ball right onto the bat, and belted it!;
62.3;4;Morkel to Lyon, FOUR runs short and misdirected, that's a poor ball but an excellent strike, attempting to cramp Lyon as he retreats to leg, but instead playing straight into his hands. Pulled firmly through the leg side;
62.2;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run extra bounce from a full length, jagging over an attempted backfoot steer;
62.1;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run banged in Lyon, angled into the body, and hops over the top of a loose wafty uppercut;
61.6;?;Maharaj to Paine, no run ouch, Maharaj wears this one in his followthrough as he drops into the long barrier to gather a firm push. An awkward bounce, right into the breadbasket;
61.5;1;Maharaj to Lyon, 1 run a pounding sweep, through the leg side. Not quite timed, but plenty intent;
61.4;?;Maharaj to Lyon, no run flicked into the leg side;

60.3;2;Morkel to Paine, 2 runs loopy slower ball, right up to the blockhole, and pushed to the off side;
60.2;1;Morkel to Lyon, 1 run neatly tucked into the leg side this time, as Lyon stands his ground on the back foot;
60.1;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run wide line, doesn't get up much, Lyon is hanging on the back foot, way outside leg, and can't reach that;

58.6;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run dropped by de Villiers at third slip! Another slash at a good length delivery, and AB tumbles back but can't cling on as the ball arrives at pace. A rarity;
58.5;4;Morkel to Lyon, FOUR runs a dismissive slap through point! Well, well, these are vital runs. Like Rabada this morning, Lyon is taking the positive approach to the short ball, leaning back and flinging the bat!;
58.4;4;Morkel to Lyon, FOUR runs that's a magnificent drive through long-off! Hitting the ball on the up, not remotely to the pitch of the ball, but what an eye. Slotted;
58.3;1;Morkel to Paine, 1 run leans forward, poked into the covers;
58.2;1;Morkel to Lyon, 1 run round the wicket, Lyon walks inside the line and pulls compactly to backward square;
58.1;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run clears the front leg and lines up a chaotic slog through the line. Short leg flees to the boundary, even if the ball doesn't;
57.6;1;Bavuma to Lyon, 1 run flipped off the pads to the leg side. That experiment was a resounding failure;
57.5;?;Bavuma to Lyon, no run that's more like it, tailing in with the reverse swing, and demands a respectful block on middle and off;
57.4;4;Bavuma to Lyon, FOUR runs short, wide, pies. Lyon gleefully thwacks another cut-drive through the covers;
57.3;4;Bavuma to Lyon, FOUR runs back of a length, crunched hard through the off side, that's a solid bit of ball-striking;
57.2;1;Bavuma to Paine, 1 run short and wide, and slapped hard to deep point;
57.1;?;Bavuma to Paine, no run a dirty dobbler outside off, actually a pretty good line and length, and uneasily wafted away;
56.6;1;Rabada to Paine, 1 run leaning forward, stabbed into the covers;
56.5;?;Rabada to Paine, no run very full and tailing into the toes, no appeal as Rabada thumps the pad, down the leg side;
56.4;1;Rabada to Lyon, 1 run a flying edge and dropped by Amla! A massive wipe through the line from Lyon, a very thick edge, flying high to the left of first slip who reaches high but can't cling on!;
56.3;?;Rabada to Lyon, no run backs away as Rabada goes wide on the crease to create an angle, and cracks firmly to point, just short of the fielder;

56.1;?;Rabada to Lyon, no run outside off, and through to the keeper;

55.2;1;Morkel to Lyon, 1 run bouncer now, swung away h-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g-h in the leg side... but it's wide of Rabada, who runs around the rope but won't get to it as the ball plops into the outfield;
55.1;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run Morkel goes full, stump-splattering length, swatted away calmly by Lyon;
54.6;?;Rabada to Paine, no run back of a length, 139kph and left alone in the channel;
54.5;?;Rabada to Paine, no run fires this one in straighter, Paine gets into line;
