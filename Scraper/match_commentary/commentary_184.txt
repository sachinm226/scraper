5.55pm Australia will be pleased with that performance. The openers set the tone from the start with a brisk stand. Warner, coming back after the birth of his second child, made a really good 93. Aaron Finch though carried on to make a ton. The innings stalled temporarily with his dismissal but Steven Smith and Glenn Maxwell played enterprising cameos to lift Australia to 348. India did not have many answers to that onslaught with the ball, but will require something special with the bat to stand any chance.

 Innings Start
10.10pm This has been some match. This has been some turnaround from Australia. Australia go 4-0 up and extend their home streak to 18 ODIs. But that will not be the story of the day. India were cruising the chase with such ease that it looked like Australia had almost given up before Dhawan had cut a ball to Bailey at point. Ever since, it was all Australia. India failed to win an over as they stumbled and staggered to an unbelievable 25-run loss. A lot of credit has to be given to Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli though, who made run-making look ridiculously simple. Splendid centuries but a real shame they could not carry on to take India home.
MS Dhoni: "Im not angry, I'm disappointed. This was one game we should have batted much better. I'll take responsibility, I should have carried on but I got out.. There was a bit of pressure on the youngsters. International cricket is all about pressure, you think about the right shot. You realise you have to take a bit more time and take the game slightly to the end. Rohit batted very well with Shikhar. And Dhawan and Kohli batted majestically. In the last five years, we have not had a fixed bowling line up other than the spinners. That pushes us to the extreme to get some extra runs.
Kane Richardson is the Man of the Match: "It's a funny old game, cricket. We always knew it would speed up once we got a wicket but we did not get it. Hastings could be up here as well. You try and bowl good balls but sometimes they go for sixes. Its our job to try and stop em.
Steven Smith: "It looked like they were cruising, a coupe, of wickets swing things. Richardson did very well as well. You have to try everything when Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan were batting, it felt like we needed 15 or 16 fielders. We had a never say die attitude tonight. When we had a sniff, we made a run for it.
49.2;W;Marsh to Sharma, OUT and that will be the game. Marsh takes the final wicket. 18 in succession at home for Australia. Full delivery outside off, a thick outside edge is easily taken by Wade. Australia go 4-0 up.;Ishant Sharma c ?Wade b Marsh 0 (8m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

46.4;?;Faulkner to Yadav, no run length outside off, Yadav is beaten;

46.1;1;Faulkner to Jadeja, 1 run length on off, pushed towards cover for a run;
45.6;?;Kane Richardson to Yadav, no run and another. Would be interesting to see if he connects well with these. Fullish outside off, Yadav goes for it with all his might again. No connection. Only a dot ball. Wicket maiden to end his spell;

45.4;?;Kane Richardson to Yadav, no run length delivery outside off, left alone;

43.6;W;Kane Richardson to R Dhawan, OUT Dhawan has to go now, he has holed out to the sweeper cover. Full delivery, cross seam from Richardson outside off.
