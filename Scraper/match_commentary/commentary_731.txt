Change in bowling, Kasprowicz replaces Lee
 Innings Start
Wonderful win for Australia, they win by 2 wickets. Players shake their hands, wonderful effort from Lee and Kasprowicz to finish it off. Good knock from Martyn. South Africa fought well but Australia came through in the end. Australia wins the series 3-0.
Langer was ready to bat and was padded up, but Lee and Kaprowicz finished it off. Ntini picked up 10 wickets for the match, Martyn the only centurion. Please stay tuned for the presentation.
Welcome back, Umpires receiving their mementoes. The Man of the match is Lee. The Man of the series is Clark for his 20 wickets. That's it for the match.
Thanks for being with us, this is your commentator Binoy George signing off. Until the next series, it is bye from all of us.
