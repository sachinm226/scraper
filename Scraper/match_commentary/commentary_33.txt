Data
4.45pm: Look at that, Mark Nicholas is straight out there with a microphone under Heinrich Klaasen's nose: "Unbelievable, my first hundred for my country, it's what you work for as a youngster, so very pleased. [Pitch?] Slow, if we bowl well, it could be a winning score. Davo [Miller] did his thing and helped get us to 290. [Defendable?] Wicket is two-paced, mix it up on a good length and hopefully that will work.
A cracking effort from Klaasen, who more than doubled his previous ODI best of 59. That total is certainly much more competitive than looked likely when SA were 48 for 3, with Klaasen and the debutant Kyle Verreynne in the middle. But that partnership helped light the way, before a stand of 149 from Klaasen and Miller gave them plenty to bowl at. Australia have some firepower of their own, and we should be in for a cracking chase. Matt'll be back for that shortly
Here's Stuart: "Hold up, didn't the computer come up with a final score of 291 at one point? If so, that is astonishing." Forecaster redeemed? No, I think Mustafa predicted 292 (on 29 Feb), while Forecaster had 286 after 37. So Mustafa wins
49.6;2;Starc to Klaasen, 2 runs short of a length, slower ball to finish and pulled down the ground... Anrich Nortje will scramble back to the danger end for a second, Klaasen completing a very respectable salvage job for SA;
49.5;2;Starc to Klaasen, 2 runs full and straight and he miscues a slog, straight up over the keeper... but Carey can't get there running back! Bit of luck for Klaasen, but he's earned that today;
49.4;1;Starc to Nortje, 1 run full outside off, sliced towards backward point and they scamper through;
49.3;W;Starc to Maharaj, OUT timber! Torpedoes off stump! Outta the ground and Maharaj is outta there... Having struck with his first ball, Starc has to wait until his 57th to pick up a second wicket with a classic yorker;Keshav Maharaj b Starc 2 (5m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
49.2;1b;Starc to Klaasen, 1 bye jumps across, goes for the switch hit, low full toss from Starc... and Klaasen misses, but they run a bye anyway!;
49.2;2w;Starc to Maharaj, 2 wide 144kph/89mph but fired down the leg side... and Klaasen spots the opportunity to steal the strike by running a bye, too. Smart work;
49.1;2;Starc to Maharaj, 2 runs full and wide from round the wicket, Maharaj bullocks a couple in front of the cover sweeper;
48.6;4;Cummins to Klaasen, FOUR runs full and wide, squirted to third man! Aiming for the tramlines with a cross-seamer but Klaasen chopped it through the infield for another welcome boundary;
48.5;2;Cummins to Klaasen, 2 runs punched through the off side, they'll come back for two;
48.4;W;Cummins to Phehlukwayo, OUT moves across, exposing all three stumps... jabbed into the leg side and Klaasen wants on, Phehlukwayo is going to be short here! Brilliant from Cummins, fielding in his follow-through to his left, turning and throwing down the stumps with the batsman nowhere!;Andile Phehlukwayo run out (Cummins) 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
48.3;?;Cummins to Phehlukwayo, no run short of a length, another offcutter and Lucky is bamboozled, dangling his bat out but can't connect;
48.2;W;Cummins to Miller, OUT short ball, follows the batsman as he goes across... flapped to the keeper! Miller looking to get cute with the ramp but ends up inside-edging a simple catch to Carey! Been a bit of a struggle at the death, but still an important innings after the strife SA were in;David Miller c ?Carey b Cummins 64 (93m 70b 4x4 1x6) SR: 91.42;
48.1;4;Cummins to Miller, FOUR runs Miller time! At last... Picks the slower ball, smokes it down the ground! Just bounces in front of the rope, a good start to the over for SA;
47.6;1;Hazlewood to Miller, 1 run on the stumps and whipped into a gap leg side - again just the one boundary off the over;
47.5;3;Hazlewood to Klaasen, 3 runs shorter, he's looking to target the same area, ramped high over short fine leg, but this one plugs in front of the rope;
47.4;4;Hazlewood to Klaasen, FOUR runs scooped for four! Klaasen upping the tempo now, moves across early and takes it on the full, down towards fine leg;
47.3;1;Hazlewood to Miller, 1 run low full toss, 135kph/84mph on leg stump and glanced to short fine leg;
47.2;?;Hazlewood to Miller, no run back of a length, cutter from Hazlewood and Miller is defeated again, swings and misses as the ball dips past off stump;
47.1;?;Hazlewood to Miller, no run in the channel, again Miller aims to heave over the leg side and fails to connect!;
46.6;6;Cummins to Klaasen, SIX runs smeared down the ground! Klaasen nails Cummins at last, creaming a baseball blow over long-on, picked the offcutter and got plenty of bat on it. SA still brawling;
46.5;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run full ball, pace on, 139kph/87mph and Miller chops an inside edge past his stumps;
46.4;?;Cummins to Miller, no run length, another cutter going away from Miller, who swipes and misses again;
46.3;?;Cummins to Miller, no run short ball, pace off and Miller swings hard, fails to connect;
46.2;1;Cummins to Klaasen, 1 run shortish outside off, Klaasen clips through square leg and immediately clenches his fist... Maiden ODI hundred for Heinrich Klaasen, off comes the helmet as he celebrates with his team-mate. He's red as a beet, it's been hot, hard work, but he's dug SA out of trouble with a fine knock;
46.1;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run pitched up, slower ball on off stump and stroked down the ground;
45.6;1;Starc to Miller, 1 run pitched up and clipped for one through midwicket, Miller keeps the strike;
45.5;4;Starc to Miller, FOUR runs slings down a low full-toss, hammered through the covers! Miller latches on and powers it to the fence!;
45.4;?;Starc to Miller, no run short ball, loopy outside off and it completely flummoxes Miller, who looks to the square leg umpire... Starc lucky to get away with that, too;
45.3;1;Starc to Klaasen, 1 run full and tailing away wide of the stumps, 142kph/88mph and squirted down to third man... on to 99 now, but Klaasen will want that all-important flake;
45.2;1lb;Starc to Miller, 1 leg bye length, scudding into the back leg, Starc goes up for lbw... No interest from the umpire, maybe too high. Miller was looking to swing that into next week;
45.1;?;Starc to Miller, no run fired full and wide, maybe a touch lucky to get away with that... kissed the tramline with Miller on his heels and swiping at thin air;
44.6;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run tries to come down and swipes aggressively through the line to long-on;
44.5;1;Cummins to Klaasen, 1 run length, stroked into a gap in the covers, Klaasen just a couple away from his own milestone;
44.4;1;Cummins to Miller, 1 run slower-ball bouncer from Cummins, Miller is forward and then has time to think about four different shots before shovelling through midwicket for one - that's fifty for Miller, at almost a run a ball. Vital knock for his side;
44.3;1;Cummins to Klaasen, 1 run short outside off, Klaasen is up on his toes and swats through point to the sweeper;
44.2;2;Cummins to Klaasen, 2 runs slower ball, full outside off and he waits for it, clips back past the bowler for two as long-on runs around;

43.3;?;Starc to Klaasen, no run slung full and wide, fading away from the right-hander, who fails to connect;
43.2;6;Starc to Klaasen, SIX runs short ball, top-edged on the pull... flies all the way to the unguarded fence at fine leg! Probably a good thing he didn't get it where he was aiming, as deep backward square would have been in the game;
43.1;1;Starc to Miller, 1 run full length and punched into the covers coming across;
42.6;1;Short to Miller, 1 run flighted, worked into a gap leg side, settle for one;

42.3;1;Short to Klaasen, 1 run tossed up and flicked into the leg side;
42.2;3;Short to Miller, 3 runs whipped leg sided, they push hard for two... and a misfield allows them to come back for a third, raising the 100 stand between this pair!;
42.1;?;Short to Miller, no run dragged down and Miller rasps a cut in front of square, brilliantly cut off by the diving Smith at extra cover. Superb work;

41.3;?;Zampa to Miller, no run pushed through and he defends from the crease;

41.1;?;Zampa to Miller, no run flattish legbreak, worked off leg stump to midwicket;

39.5;1;Zampa to Miller, 1 run comes down and swipes through mid-on;
39.4;4lb;Zampa to Miller, 4 leg byes tossed, outside leg stump and Miller sweeps, did he get bat on it? Zampa was appealing for lbw, but that was optimistic. Runs very fine and Cummins can't cut it off, goes down as leg byes, though;
39.3;1;Zampa to Klaasen, 1 run floated up, Klaasen is forward again and dinks through the covers;
39.2;2;Zampa to Klaasen, 2 runs pushed through, Klaasen is forward and swipes fine of long-on for a couple - SA raise the 200 in the 40th over;

36.2;?;Hazlewood to Miller, no run edged but short of the keeper! Pitched up and drew an expansive drive, Carey went full length to his left... but it didn't quite carry. Looks like it was an offcutter, so lack of pace saved Miller;
36.1;2;Hazlewood to Miller, 2 runs good length, worked off the legs again, they'll hustle two - that's the 50 stand between these two;
35.6;1;Marsh to Miller, 1 run length ball on the stumps, Miller nudges one through mid-on;
35.5;2;Marsh to Miller, 2 runs back of a length and nudged off the hip, looked like a tight second... but Miller runs well to beat the throw from deep backward square;

17.5;?;Short to Klaasen, no run rocks back and gets leg side of this, pressed into the covers on the back foot;
17.4;3;Short to Verreynne, 3 runs slides down the leg side, poor ball from Short, Verreynne gets down early to sweep and Marsh gets round to save a run on the dive;
17.3;2;Short to Verreynne, 2 runs rocks back and slashes a cut shot behind square, Starc gets round to field;
17.2;3;Short to Klaasen, 3 runs fired through outside off, carved wide of mid-off on the back foot. Finch bumbles back and just about cuts it off, bit of a village effort but managed to flick it back in;

13.4;1;Short to Klaasen, 1 run pushed through and clipped behind square on the leg side;
13.3;?;Short to Klaasen, no run flighted, skidding into the pads as Klaasen sweeps... Short liked it, but I thought it pitched outside leg. Finch, after some discussion, elects to review. Was that a googly? No, apparently the legbreak, and Hawk-Eye has it pitching just outside - umpire's call - and then spinning sharply past the wicket. So not a good review;

9.1;W;Cummins to Bavuma, OUT dragged on! Cummins strikes and this is already looking sticky for South Africa... Bavuma had been playing nicely but he's misjudged the bounce, maybe too close for the cut shot, too, and he cannons a thick bottom edge into his timbers.

8.3;?;Hazlewood to Bavuma, no run on the stumps and nudged to the on side;
8.2;2;Hazlewood to Bavuma, 2 runs dropped! Shanked over the on side, should be a simple take for Starc running back at mid-on, but he shells it! Coming over his shoulder but he was in position, got both hands to it, only to bar-of-soap it and give Temba a life!;
8.1;?;Hazlewood to Bavuma, no run shortish around off stump, Temba defends;
7.6;3;Cummins to Bavuma, 3 runs pitched up at 146kph/91mph, Bavuma is timing the ball like a Swiss watchmaker today, strokes three more through the covers to finish a somewhat expensive over;
7.6;1w;Cummins to Bavuma, 1 wide dug in again, 141kph/88mph but too much bounce this time, Bavuma ignores and SA get one more to the total;
7.6;1w;Cummins to Bavuma, 1 wide banged in down the leg side, Bavuma pulls and misses - but he'll have another chance, as it's called wide;

6.6;?;Hazlewood to Bavuma, no run fullish, Bavuma comes across and punches to mid-off;

6.3;?;Hazlewood to Verreynne, no run fired in straight, length delivery and he tucks it to midwicket;
6.2;W;Hazlewood to de Kock, OUT oh Quinny... dabbles one to the keeper, South Africa's captain is gone! A respectable length ball in the channel, nothing more, but de Kock falls trying to open the face and run one behind square. Audible nick, straightforward take for Carey, Hazlewood does the business;Quinton de Kock c ?Carey b Hazlewood 15 (30m 16b 1x4 0x6) SR: 93.75;

5.5;1;Cummins to Bavuma, 1 run length ball sliding in to the right-hander and worked away through midwicket;
5.4;?;Cummins to Bavuma, no run short ball, leg side as Bavuma pulls and it sails through to Carey... Cummins went up for it, but there wasn't much support. Looks like it missed the glove;

5.2;?;Cummins to Bavuma, no run short of a length, 143kph/89mph outside off and stabbed behind square, straight to Smith;

4.6;?;Starc to Bavuma, no run full and whipped off the pads, a spoonful of sugar for Temba... who is annoyed to have picked out midwicket, for no return;
4.5;?;Starc to Bavuma, no run drops short, 143kph/89mph and flying through outside off stump, no stroke;
4.4;4;Starc to Bavuma, FOUR runs full, not much swing now, rifled through the covers for four! Beautifully timed by Bavuma, who just leans forward into this, sends a zipping drive to the rope;

3.3;?;Hazlewood to Bavuma, no run fullish, angling in at 136kph/84mph and tucked towards midwicket;
3.2;?;Hazlewood to Bavuma, no run lovely line, dragging Bavuma out as he looks to drive on the up again, beaten past the outside edge!;

2.6;1;Starc to de Kock, 1 run length, 145kph/90mph and de Kock pokes, so close to dragging on! Still a little tentative here against Starc, but gets away with this, and they scamper the single as short fine leg comes around;

1.3;4;Hazlewood to Bavuma, FOUR runs touch full, 134kph/83mph and skelped through extra cover once more! Not a half-volley, by any means, and some swing, too, but it shaped right into the meat of Temba's bat as he stepped out to drive;
1.2;?;Hazlewood to Bavuma, no run shaping away this time, not there for the drive and Bavuma leaves it be;
1.1;4;Hazlewood to Bavuma, FOUR runs pitched up in the channel, invites the drive and Bavuma accepts, drilling four through the covers! Decent chase from the fielder but he couldn't quite time his dive to reel it in;

0.1;W;Starc to Malan, OUT full and swinging, 143kph/89mph, did that hit him on the boot?? Nigel Llong immediately turned away from the appeal, but Finch reviews, and this could be a sensational start for Australia! Definitely hit the bat, but it looks as if it crashed into the toe first - and this is stone dead, if so. Yes, boot first, that's plumb, golden duck for Malan on debut! Smashing the base of middle stump, Starc rips one out with his first ball! Boo-yah!;Janneman Malan lbw b Starc 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

Mitchell Starc has one of the new pills in hand. Two slips in place, Malan on strike
12.55pm: So, new-look South Africa, but can they cast off the the grubby overalls of their recent bad form. Looking forward to seeing Janneman Malan - brother of Peter - opening the batting today. Both he and fellow new boy Verreynne have a reputation for letting rip.
"Really? Little riding on it? An international 50 over match between 2 teams and nations totally pissed off with each other over events of 2 years ago? One of these sides could be real close to number 1 in all 3 forms when the recalibration happens in May? Little riding on it? Perhaps we see England's problem here." And good afternoon to you, too, Andrew Schulz. Always a pleasure. Come back to me in three years when the 50-over World Cup is about to start and we'll put this series into proper context...
12.45pm: Right, who's up for this? Sadly, as yet, there are no World Cup qualifier points on the line, just the old-fashioned rankings at stake. Not had a look at the Boland Park deck yet, but we're expecting something pretty batsman friendly. Good luck tucking in liberally against Starc, Cummins and Hazlewood, though...
"Is Mitch Marsh fit you bowl?" wonders Craig. "They're going to have to get 10 overs between Marsh, Short and possibly Marnus... bit of a weakness there..." Yes, I think MMarsh bowled in one of the T20Is, so I expect they'll be looking to cobble the overs there... and banking on the added batting depth, if required
And here's Kalyan: "I love to support SA when they play the Aussies. Sincerely hope we see an upgraded performance with bat & ball by SA and they give a chance to their supporters to be happy !!!!"
12.30pm: South Africa win the toss and bat, they've included Janneman Malan and Kyle Verreynne for ODI debuts. Temba Bavuma is also fit to return, back in the No. 3 berth. Australia, meanwhile, have gone for something of a change-up in the middle order, with D'Arcy Short included as the spinning allrounder at No.7. That means no Ashton Agar, while Josh Hazlewood completes a Test-quality pace trio.
South Africa: 1 Quinton de Kock (wk, capt), 2 Janneman Malan, 3 Temba Bavuma, 4 Kyle Verreynne, 5 Heinrich Klaasen, 6 David Miller, 7 Andile Phehlukwayo, 8 Keshav Maharaj, 9 Lungi Ngidi, 10 Anrich Nortje, 11 Tabraiz Shamsi
Australia: 1 Aaron Finch (capt), 2 David Warner, 3 Steven Smith, 4 Marnus Labuschagne, 5 Mitchell Marsh, 6 Alex Carey (wk), 7 D'Arcy Short, 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Pat Cummins, 10 Josh Hazlewood, 11 Adam Zampa
12.25pm: There's been a bushfire raging nearby, in the wonderfully named Du Toitskloof Pass, but it doesn't look as if smoke is going to be an issue for the start of the game. Firdose Moonda is our gumshoe on the ground and will keep us up to speed (once she's battled through the traffic).
Meanwhile, it's Leapers Day, which is a special one for a member of the Australia party (he was in the T20I squad but I think is no longer around), as Mustafa Moudi points out: "Happy 7th Birthday to Sean Abbott as he Turns 28 Today. Hope this comment get published as for others, they can get wishes next year if not this year but this poor guy will have to wait another 4 years if not his year."
12.10pm: Morning all, welcome to unexclusively live 2D text coverage of the first ODI between South Africa and Australia - a series marooned at the end of the southern summer with little riding on it, bar bragging rights (of which there are always plenty in this fixture). South Africa have been further beset by injuries, and as Matt Roller writes in his preview, it has loaded the pressure on to Quinton de Kock, captain-keeper-opener in both white-ball formats. They are without a series win since March last year, and will have to go some if they are to end that barren run against a pretty much full-strength Australia. I'm Alan Gardner, all set for a Paarl scorcher, and I'll be joined by Matt to bring you the bish-bash-bosh today. Toss and teams in 20...
 Innings Start
8.41pm: Stick with us for some post-match analysis and reaction from Firdose Moonda at the ground. shortly. Interested to hear Finch's rationale for leaving Agar out, given how effective South Africa's spinners were - combined figures of 3 for 93 in Shamsi and Maharaj's 20 overs, as Sarat points out. Firdose's report will magically appear here within the next few moments, but aside from that, it's farewell from Ranjith, Alan and myself, and we'll be back on Wednesday for the 2nd ODI at Bloemfontein as Australia look to draw level. Cheerio!
Mustafa Moudi: "Australia's middle order is paper thin without Maxwell and Handscomb. Yes Maxwell is injured right now but he wasn't picked for India tour either sighting his form... They need to stop this blind experimentation and go back to the proven duo!" Lots of weeping and gnashing of teeth about Maxwell on this theme throughout the day, so to clarify: he was picked for both the T20I and ODI legs of this tour, but was ruled out with an elbow injury.
Lungisa: "Did anyone notice that Australia didn't hit a single six in this innings?"
Saoirse: "Surely Klaasen for MOTM but let's not forget the fine bowling from Ngidi" Yep, expect it will be. Looked a good innings at halfway, and even better with hindsight.
8.35pm So a convincing 74-run win in the end for South Africa. Australia lost their last seven wickets for just 43 runs, failing comprehensively to build on Smith and Labuschagne's partnership. The asking rate continued to climb after the powerplay, as that pair tried to take the game deep, but both of them got out at an awkward time, leaving a tricky scenario for new batsmen on a pitch that suited pace-off options. That left Ngidi, Phehlukwayo and Shamsi to wrap things up in the back half and they duly did.
45.1;W;Nortje to Hazlewood, OUT bursts through him, 87mph/140kph, too quick for Hazlewood backing away and it pegs back the off stump! South Africa wrap up an impressive victory, going 1-0 up in a series for the fourth time this home summer... will this be the one that they turn into a series win?;Josh Hazlewood b Nortje 1 (4m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
44.6;4;Phehlukwayo to Zampa, FOUR runs slower ball on a length, Zampa cracks this out of the middle and it lands just short of the rope at midwicket. Awesome sound off the bat!;

44.1;W;Phehlukwayo to Cummins, OUT pace-off outside the off stump, slogged miles up into the air, and Verreynne takes a screamer running in from long-on! Covers acres of ground coming in off the rope towards mid-on, diving forward, no doubt about the legality this time, grabbing it an inch or two off the turf, and Cummins has to trudge off. Superb from Verreynne, his third catch of the night on ODI debut;Pat Cummins c Verreynne b Phehlukwayo 6 (9m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 85.71;
43.6;1;Shamsi to Cummins, 1 run shifts across to the off side, and slog sweeps to deep square;

43.1;W;Shamsi to Short, OUT length ball, decent turn, Short runs down looking to slug him into next week, swipes at thin air and doesn't even bother trying to get back! Miles out of his crease, punches his bat on the walk off. De Kock gathered coolly, just about nudging the bails off with as little effort as possible, and Shamsi taps his temple as if to say "I've got in your head, D'Arce." Australia eight down!;D'Arcy Short st ?de Kock b Shamsi 18 (41m 24b 1x4 0x6) SR: 75;

41.6;1;Shamsi to Starc, 1 run tossed up on fourth stump, toe-ended out to Miller at short cover who hurls towards the non-striker's end and it would have been out with a direct hit, but he was off-balance, and he misses by a fair few inches;

41.1;?;Shamsi to Starc, no run turns on a length, straight to Miller at short cover, bounces up sharply off the square and smacks him in the mouth! Think he's OK, but he's having a fiddle with a few teeth to make sure everything is in order.;

39.4;W;Shamsi to Carey, OUT spooned up in the air, "CATCH IT!" screams Shamsi, and Verreynne at long-off duly obliges! The pressure tells, Carey was horribly bogged down, unable to beat the infield.

34.1;W;Nortje to Smith, OUT pinned on the pad, Nortje strikes and Smith is a goner! He asks Carey whether it's worth the review, but it looks fairly adjacent as Smudger trudges off! Length ball, decent bounce off the pitch. Smith was deep in the crease, looking to work through the leg side and pinned on the top of the pad. Might have been tight on height, but it's given, and that's a massive breakthrough for SA.... EDIT: Yep, ball-tracking confirms it was smashing into the top of leg stump.

23.5;?;Shamsi to Labuschagne, no run is that a missed stumping chance? Tough one for de Kock, skidded through low down the leg side, but he couldn't gather it cleanly! Although, to be honest, these two aren't currently hurting SA, so why bother changing things? Cunning, Quinny;

Warner isn't going anywhere in a hurry... we're going upstairs, but the soft signal is out, which is so often important. Verreynne is the catcher... looks like he's jammed his fingers underneath the ball to me. These things always look worse in slow-motion. We're onto our second angle, which is completely useless, can't tell anything from here. Or from the third for that matter. I can't see that there will be conclusive evidence to the contrary of the soft signal... and Warner is given out! Slightly full of a length in the channel, pushed aerially to cover point, and Verreynne diving forward just about did the rest;David Warner c Verreynne b Ngidi 25 (37m 27b 3x4 0x6) SR: 92.59;
