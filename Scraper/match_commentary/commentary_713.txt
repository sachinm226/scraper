7.20pm Match abandoned. This had been becoming increasingly likely following continual rain. So, New Zealand now need to win at Hobart on Thursday to retain the title, while a win for Australia (or no-result) will hand it to their rivals.
Australia will be disappointed with the weather today as they had New Zealand three down after only six overs. Thanks for joining me today and do come back on Thursday where it will be a winner-takes-all affair.

7.15pm Antiques Roadshow has long since finished on TV and in its place, Michael Slater is cycling around in a four-man bike contraption in a health show.
7.00pm Drizzle... and more drizzle... Play is very unlikely now.
6.15pm As the time passes, it's looking increasingly less likely that we'll get a game here. If there's no match today, a win for New Zealand in Hobart will mean they retain the three-match series 1-1. Some good news for Australia, though, golfer Craig Parry has won the Australian Open.
5.40pm Nothing good in the way of news, I'm afraid. There are plenty of umbrellas up, plenty voting with their feet. Play can be called off at 8pm, but it may happen earlier.
The crowd are making their own entertainment. No, not beer snakes but paper planes are being made and thrown towards the outfield and when one makes it there's a loud cheer.
The weather looks set in and, an ominous sign, Nine has switched to regular programming. It's the Antiques Roadshow all the way.
5.15pm Still raining, I'm afraid. The puddles are getting puddlier. The groundstaff reckon that, even if/when the rain stops, they will need a further 45-minutes to clear the area.
4.45pm Famous, and not-so-famous last words... the rain has now got pretty heavy so it doesn't look like we'll see much action soon.
4.30pm Rain, rainy, rainiest. Actually, it doesn't look too bad if we take a look at the radar - always gets me how the English invented cricket in such a rainy country... There'll be a few overs lost already. Something more for you to check out while we drum our fingers.
4pm It's still raining... What else is going on in the world? Hmm, not much. There's this, some historical that and if you're really bored, then there's the other.
3.40pm No news is good news, and this news is bad news... the rain's continuing, folks.
3.30pm The rain's been getting harder so off come the players and on comes the tractor trailing the covers. I'll keep you posted with a weather-watch.

3.00pm So we're ready to roll now. They look like swinging conditions out there, and Lee's fired up, ready to go from the Randwick End. Two slips in.
2.50pm The Aussies are out warming up, Nathan Bracken bowling a cricket ball, Michael Hussey playing with an AFL ball. Hope nobody steps on the odd-shaped ball a la Glenn McGrath in the 2005 Ashes. We're all gearing up for the start now, it's just ten minutes away. No confirmation as yet as to whether McCullum or Hopkins will keep though when they've both played in the past it's usually McCullum who has the gloves. Nine have Hopkins, but I guess that's something we'll discover in another fifty overs. Meanwhile, New Zealand are preparing to bat and again face their pace demons - they did pretty well on Friday and will aim to keep up that momentum today.
2.40pm Australia are unchanged from Friday, so they again look like this: Matthew Hayden, Adam Gilchrist (wk), Ricky Ponting (capt), Michael Clarke, Andrew Symonds, Michael Hussey, James Hopes, Brett Lee, Brad Hogg, Nathan Bracken, Shaun Tait.
New Zealand maintain the faith in Lou Vincent despite a poor run in South Africa and a slim picking in the opener in Australia. Gareth Hopkins, though, is in for Mathew Sinclair while Jeetan Patel is in for Mark Gillespie. They line up thus: Lou Vincent, Brendon McCullum, Jamie How, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Gareth Hopkins, Jacob Oram, Kyle Mills, Daniel Vettori (capt), Jeetan Patel, Chris Martin.
2.35pm Daniel Vettori has won the toss for the second time in these two matches and, as he did in Adelaide, he's chosen to bat. "We've just got to put a score on the board," he told Nine, which makes sense, really... "There's all the talk around that it's going to be a shortened game." With the weather, that is, rather than he thinks New Zealand are going to get knocked over.
They've brought an extra spinner into the side, so Jeetan Patel comes in to the side. I'll confirm the teams in a tick but can tell you that play is scheduled to start at 3pm, that's 4am GMT (not that many of you in that timezone will be following right now). Also, no overs have been lost which isn't a surprise really - play was help up for 48 minutes during Friday's match and we lost nothing.
Ricky Ponting, meanwhile, was not disappointed to be asked to field. "We've got to bowl first," he said, "so hopefully we can make the use of the early conditions and swing it around a bit."
2.30pm So, the toss is imminent now and the two captains are slowly wandering out there. Can you wander quickly, I wonder? The pitch looks pretty hard, no real surprises given Australia's pace battery.
2.20pm Four words to delight cricket fans everywhere: "The covers coming off." My fiance's dad has just told me a cricket joke that's sadly unrepeatable as we're a family website, but it was a good one, but an oldie, so thanks Chris.
2.15pm The rain appears to be lifting, folks, how good is that? Fingers crossed we get some news on when the toss will be soon. Sydney's been pretty rainy recently, so let's hope for a full match. Good signs, the umpires are walking out to the middle right now.
2.10pm There's a slight delay to the start, but remember the rain isn't too heavy, so hopefully it will pass through soon. Showers are coming from the north-west and the radar is showing some heavier rain on its way later on.
2pm ESDT Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the second match of this Chappell-Hadlee Series in Sydney where, sadly, the covers are currently on as there's rain about. No details as yet as to whether the start will be delayed although there's no toss as of yet, but I will keep you up-to-date with progress as soon as I know anything, I being Jenny Thompson, hello. The rain, at least, is only a light sprinkling, not enough to halt proceedings if they were playing.
So, Australia are one up in their bid to regain one of the few trophies not in their bulging cabinet following a commanding victory in among the rain on Friday evening in Adelaide, where their bowlers did a tidy job to keep New Zealand to 254 and then Ricky Ponting scored his 24th one-day century after Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden had launched them with a quickfire platform.
New Zealand's batsmen at least answered the questions asked of their ability to face the pace, with Brendon McCullum shining in particular with 96, along with Ross Taylor's confidence-boosting 50.
More on this match as soon as I've got it as New Zealand will hope to get underway soon in their bid to square this series. A win for Australia today would mean they lift the trophy.
