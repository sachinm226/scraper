Thanks, Sriram. Welcome back for the second half of this match. I'll take you through to the end. The target for West Indies is 241. Their middle order has struggled in this series and West Indies would be relying heavily on Brian Lara, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan to see them through.
The Australians are out on the field taking their positions. Brett Lee is just going through his paces ahead of taking the new ball. Gayle and Chanderpaul are out in the middle.
That's it from me, Sriram Veera. Jamie Alter will pick up the chase.

**********************************************
Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the DLF Cup. This is Binoy George, and I'll be taking you through the action as it unfolds at the Kinrara Academy Oval at Malaysia.
We've witnessed some intense cricket in the league matches, and it all now comes down to this game - the Grand Final. World Champions Australia take on the West Indies in this Winner-takes-all game.
Australia, edged India out of the title clash in the last league match on the 22nd September, while West Indies booked their spot earlier in the tournament.
There's been a contest within a contest in almost every match in this tournament, and in this match, its again going to be the clash of the two titans - Glenn McGrath Vs Brian Lara. McGrath has been as good as ever, keeping the ball in the right areas and forcing the batsmen to make mistakes - who could tell from his performance here that he had had a prolonged absence from international cricket.
Lara, on the other hand, has shown glimpses of his good form, and the West Indies will be hoping that Lara carries his good form into this title clash, and further into the ICC Champions Trophy that will be played in a fortnight's time.
The weather forecast doesn't look all that promising for this all important game - the met department has predicted spells of rain through the day.
Pitch report: The pitch for today's match is the same pitch that had been used for 4 other matches earlier in the tournament; there is some wear and tear and it is expected to play slow. The team winning the toss would surely like to bat first.
It is the time for the toss, Ricky Ponting flips the coin in the air, tails called by Lara, it comes down as head, Ponting opts to bat.
Toss: Australia have won the toss and elected to bat.
Teams: The Australian team for the final Katich, Watson, Ponting, Clarke, Symonds, Hussey, Martyn, Haddin, Lee, Bracken and McGrath. For West Indies Gayle, Chanderpaul, Sarwan, Lara, Bravo, Smith, Hinds, Morton, Carlton Baugh, Taylor and Bradshaw.
Ponting had hinted at the toss that Shane Watson would be coming up the order. Please stay tuned, intense contest on the cards, join us in a few minutes when the action starts.
 Innings Start
So there you have it: Australia have comprehensively defeated West Indies to secure another ODI title. They outshone the opposition in all departments of the game today, as exemplified by fighting fifties from Martyn and Symonds, some effective pace bowling from Bracken and Lee, and Ponting's work in the field.
The West Indies never looked in the chase after Lee nailed Gayle with the first delivery of the innings, and then the top and middle order just crumbled to Bracken's accurate left-arm pace. Watson chipped in with a couple wickets before Lee returned to finish off the tail. The sad scene of Runako Morton struggling through for 32 deliveries and not even scoring a run somehow summed up the scenario for West Indies.
Speaking to Ian Bishop during the post-match presentation, Lara displays his disappointment: "The batting was poor and we have alot of work to do. We have a few matches leading into the ICC Champions Trophy and we have some work to do."
Ponting, his opposite number, is all smiles: "We've been in our fair share of trouble, but today was pleasing...to come away with a win here after experimenting with our players is good...the communication out on the field was encouraging..."
The Man-of-the-Match award goes to Lee for his 4 for 24 - Ponting hailed him as the "best bowler in one-day cricket" - and he also gets the Man-of-the-Series award for his 12 wickets from just three matches.
That's all we have for you. I hope you've enjoyed Cricinfo's coverage of the DLF Cup. For now, this is Jamie Alter signing off. Cheers!
