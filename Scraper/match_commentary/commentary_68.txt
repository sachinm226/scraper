Innings break Brilliant performance from India's bowlers. Australia never got going at any stage after Finch fell in the second over. Shami was outstanding up front and the spinners strangled Australia's middle order. Australia struggled to rotate the strike and then boundaries became hard to find. India will be looking to mow this down with ease. Australia need early wickets. Debayan will be back to take you through the start of the chase.

Meanwhile, a year that featured the Commonwealth and Asian Games was bound to throw up memorable, historic even, performances. But the range of nominees in the ESPN.in Awards for 2018 reveals how Indian athletes excelled through the year.

Gautam: "The Indian pace duo is bowling brilliantly although the Hyderabad track is always known to b flat.. Poor Finch problems for Australia first up"
 Innings Start
9.47pm So India draw first blood in this series. There's an obvious mismatch in terms of personnel, especially in the batting department (today's starting XI for India had seven players in the top eight who have more than 1000 ODI runs, a figure only Aaron Finch and Glenn Maxwell had on the Australian side) but the bowling from Australia should make them competitive over the course of this series. Look forward to your company for the second ODI in three days' time.
Stick around, because Shashank Kishore's report will drop by shortly.
For the moment, this is Debayan Sen bidding adieu on behalf of Alex Malcolm and Binoy George. Follow the game with ESPNcricinfo!
Presentation time
Kedar Jadhav is the player of the match. Says: "(on the wicket) My bowling is all about reading what the batsman is trying to do. The idea is to bowl stump-to-stump. The best part about my bowler is that I don't think like a bowler. I just enjoy my bowling. (On his innings) Recently in Australia, we put up a similar kind of chase. When you have Mahibhai at the other end, you don't have to worry about a lot. I get to learn a lot from him. Nobody better than him in the middle to learn the game from. We are looking forward to every game, and we learn from our captain that we need to keep our intensity up. I guess I have tried to play more shots, but plenty of times he tells you that the team needs me to be more solid."
Aaron Finch: "We were about 20 or 30 short. Especially after we lost one wicket, we had to take it deeper. But our bowlers did well, continued taking wickets, and they were really good. If you have a guy go on and get 80, and that's what you are trying to do. Just a bit more attention to detail. We tried our best with the ball. I think our quicks are most effective when they are banging the wicket. There were a few plays-and-misses, but that happens against a high-quality side."
Virat Kohli: "It was a difficult game. I thought we did really well with the ball. The wicket didn't offer as much as it did under the lights. Their partnership was outstandin. I think the bowling (won the game for us) although we wanted to get a partnership going. The way Kedar and MS took responsibility was outstanding. (On Jadeja) Amazing. 10 overs for less than 35 runs. Just the tight lines he bowled and set the fields accordingly. He's a great asset in the field too. (On Kuldeep and Shami) Brilliant, the way Shami has come into the white-ball set up. Never seen him so lean before. Got Maxi (Maxwell) out on 40-odd with a beautiful wicket. Just looking good for the World Cup."
Mohammad Shami tells Sanjay Manjrekar: "This year has been one where we have worked really hard. We enjoy our training and you get to the see the results on the field. I hope that we continue to enjoy playing together and performing for the country. (On consistency across spells) There have been ups and downs in life, but it is cricket that has brought me here. I just try to give my best for the team, and I keep taking feedback from the experienced players. I have focused more on my line and length in the last 18 months. (On fitness) When I returned from injuries, I had gone up to 93kg, and then I realised I needed to lose weight. I thank every one who pushes me, and I have maintained my weight since then."
9.25pm India go 1-0 up in this series, but it was not for want of effort from the Australians. Australia gritted and fought away in the face of some superb Indian bowling to first post 236, but it was always going to be just about 20-25 runs short on a slow surface with variable bounce. They still did well to drag India back from 80 for 1 to have them reeling at one stage on 99 for 4. But Dhoni and Jadhav batted the situation astutely. Kept the runs coming, and never let the run-rate go alarmingly high. Fitting that they stayed together to see India over the line, with Dhoni getting the winning hit

45.1;2;Zampa to Jadhav, 2 runs he goes back and pushes a length ball towards deep midwicket. A misfield allows them to come back for two. That is very un-Australian!;

44.5;4;Stoinis to Jadhav, FOUR runs short ball, and he has fetched this all the way to backward square leg. Well played, because he had to keep this to the left of long leg, and did it perfectly!;

42.6;2;Stoinis to Jadhav, 2 runs slower ball, and he runs it down to fine leg. They want two...and get there. FIFTY for Jadhav!;
42.5;1;Stoinis to Dhoni, 1 run short, and he goes back and gets it towards backward square leg. Wants two, but has to turn it down, as Handscomb is very fast to the ball and to release it;
42.4;?;Stoinis to Dhoni, no run length, and he goes back to defend this towards short midwicket;
42.3;?;Stoinis to Dhoni, no run length ball, and he pushes it towards short cover. Misfield, and he wants one, but Finch covers up from conventional cover, and rifles a throw in;

37.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Dhoni, no run tries a lofted shot to a short ball again, and this time Stoinis has gotten to the ball! Has he taken it, though? The soft signal is not out, so there needs to be conclusive evidence to get this in the fielder's favour. Short ball again, and Stoinis went across from mid on, and stuck his left hand out. From visual evidence, it looks like it has bounced. Should be not out;
37.2;6;Coulter-Nile to Dhoni, SIX runs lofted a length ball, from outside off, and makes it carry over the midwicket fence! Good power to get that ball from outside off towards the gap;
37.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Dhoni, no run length, outside off, and he drives it towards short cover;

6.5;?;Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, no run length, angles away, and again beats the outside edge. This has been an excellent but unlucky opening spell. Could have had both batsmen!;

236 is obviously not a great total to defend, and as one of you wrote, it felt at times like Australia were playing 20th century ODI cricket. Interestingly, the lowest total Australia defended against India in a completed 50-over match was back in 1990. More recently, they did defend a total of just 235 in the TVS Cup final of 2003 in Kolkata. If you notice, the Indian batting lineup was a lot better on paper than the Australian bowling then, just like today. Could that inspire an Australian fightback?
