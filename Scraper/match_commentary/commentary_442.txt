Shimmy: "Can you declare as a bowling team ? "
 Innings Start
Much better show from Bangladesh. This is their second highest score - they hit 296 against India - against Test-playing nations. Tamim gave the start, Kayes built on it and there were contributions from Nafees and Mahmudullah but Australia still win this by 66 runs.
Please wait for the quotes from the post-match ceremony
Man of the match is Hussey: "It was a great day. I really enjoyed it. It was a big chase for them but I thought they chased it well. I was in a bit earlier than lot of my innings; judging the conditions and get a move-on from there. It was a such a good batting pitch that we could get the momentum going. There wasn't much for the bowlers, not much spin, quite different from the first game."
Man of the series is Shane Watson: "After the second game and today to get 360, it was a quite a good platform. The guys were able to get the momentum going. It's been a lot of fun;; this is my first tour of Bangladesh and it was nice to have played as well as we have."
Shakib: "We batted really well. we executed our plans with the bat. We haven';t bowled well with the ball in the three games. It's a learning process and we will learn from it. Everytime you play a bigger team, you learn from them .. how they approached themselves when they batted and the areas where they bowled. Nafees came back into the team after a long time and scored consistently. Riaz and Kayes have performed well."
Clarke: "It was a good series. Outstanding effort from the boys. Ferguson, Paine were with us through the world-cup, were keen to get a game. Pattinson made his debut. Philosphy of captaincy? Keep winning! I am lucky that Ponting is in the team. As a young captain I need to keep learning. Watson is enjoying his batting and also doing the job with the ball. We hope he can continue with his purple patch."
That's it from us. Good bye and good luck.
