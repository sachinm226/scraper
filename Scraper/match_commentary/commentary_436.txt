Very good recovery from Australia puts them in charge. England were impressive at times and tawdry at others. 19 wides tells you all you need to know, Australia have probably 19 too many. Andrew McGlashan will have a bulletin ready shortly and we'll be back in about 30mins. In the meantime check out our YouTube channel.
49.6;2;Finn to Krejza, 2 runs the final ball is sliced over the infield down to deep long-off, Voges finishes unbeaten on 80;
49.5;2;Finn to Krejza, 2 runs big mow from a length ball skews off the inside edge into the midwicket region;
49.4;2;Finn to Krejza, 2 runs another slower ball but this time Krejza got all of it and it's crunched to deep point;
49.3;?;Finn to Krejza, no run Krejza misses a slower ball and cries "aarrgh";
49.2;1;Finn to Voges, 1 run slower ball dragged from outside off stump into the leg side but just for a single this time;
49.1;2;Finn to Voges, 2 runs slower ball but crucially it's straight, bunted to mid-on and some very swift running turns one into two;
49.1;2w;Finn to Krejza, 2 wide how long will this over last!? Banged in short and it sails over the batsman, Davies just about gets a hand on it so they run byes as well;
49.1;1w;Finn to Krejza, 1 wide Finn starts the final over by shoving it down the leg side for another wide;
48.6;2;Anderson to Voges, 2 runs Voges backs away and Anderson lands another slow bouncer that is swatted in front of midwicket to end, finally, Anderson's bowling in Australia. He's had an incredible tour;
48.5;2;Anderson to Voges, 2 runs slower bouncer is wheeled away to deep midwicket and then there is sudden alarm as the batsmen come back for two, not sure how they made it but in the end it was clearly home;
48.4;W;Anderson to Hastings, OUT Hastings backed away without looking too sure of what he was doing, Anderson banged it in a touch shorter and a thickish top edge looped out to cover;John Hastings c Wright b Anderson 6 (10m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 150;
48.3;1;Anderson to Voges, 1 run a touch leg-sided again and swung to fine leg;

48.2;2;Anderson to Voges, 2 runs driven uppishly towards long-on now and and lands safely again, they hare back for a couple more;
48.1;2;Anderson to Voges, 2 runs clipped high over midwicket now, more like a chip shot as it lands short of the man in the deep;
41.6;1;Plunkett to Voges, 1 run again Voges gets the late cut away but third man is wider now to cut off those boundaries;
41.5;?;Plunkett to Voges, no run good line from Plunkett, giving Voges no width, and it's defended;
41.4;?;Plunkett to Voges, no run guides this cut to gully and can't beat Bell;
41.3;2;Plunkett to Voges, 2 runs a little too short from Plunkett and Voges is quickly on to this pull, along the ground to deep midwicket for two more;
41.2;?;Plunkett to Voges, no run Voges defends this with a straight bat;
41.1;1;Plunkett to Johnson, 1 run flicked off the hips of Johnson, who will get his eye in for a couple of overs before they think about the Powerplay;
40.6;1;Wright to Johnson, 1 run punched through cover for a comfortable single;
40.5;?;Wright to Johnson, no run defended away safely;

40.2;?;Wright to Voges, no run flicked to mid-on and can't find a run;
40.1;?;Wright to Voges, no run fullish and straight from Wright, and the drive from Voges finds mid-on;
47.6;1;Finn to Voges, 1 run punched down the ground for a single to long-off;
47.5;1;Finn to Hastings, 1 run slower ball from Finn, and Hastings nudges a single to the leg side;
47.4;4;Finn to Hastings, FOUR runs a valuable boundary now as Finn goes down leg once more, and Hastings glances it fine enough to beat the man at fine leg, who makes a desperate but unsuccessful slide;
47.3;1;Finn to Voges, 1 run Voges backs away a little and punches it back past Finn for a single;
47.2;2;Finn to Voges, 2 runs slower ball from Finn, who decides just to bowl straight, and Voges cuts hard for two runs as Bell at point knocks it down without taking it cleanly;
47.2;1w;Finn to Voges, 1 wide once again Finn is tricked by the wandering of Voges, who backs off, then walks across outside leg and tries to hook a ball that Finn speared down leg. Wide called.;
47.1;1;Finn to Hastings, 1 run good bouncer - well-directed, and Hastings can only fend this away for a run;
47.1;1w;Finn to Hastings, 1 wide Hastings walks across towards leg and this one sails down the leg side - wide is called;
46.6;2;Anderson to Voges, 2 runs pulled through midwicket for a couple;
46.5;W;Anderson to Johnson, OUT Prior has taken a stunner in the deep! Oh, he can catch it without gloves after all! Johnson swung from the hips, trying to clear the boundary at midwicket, and Prior was about 10 metres inside, then backed back and leapt high to take the catch above his head - terrific catch.;Mitchell Johnson c Prior b Anderson 26 (31m 25b 2x4 0x6) SR: 104;
46.4;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run driven clunkily back to Anderson;
46.3;2;Anderson to Johnson, 2 runs high, high, higgggh chance from Johnson! And Finn has missed it! Johnson has tried to whack Anderson over midwicket a big leading edge flies a long way up and Finn at short third man runs back, swirls around and totally misjudges it, not an easy one at all;
46.2;1;Anderson to Voges, 1 run fullish and straight, and Voges punches a drive to mid-off;
46.1;2;Anderson to Voges, 2 runs Voges works it along the ground through midwicket and again it's good running to collect two more;
39.6;2;Plunkett to Johnson, 2 runs well played by Johnson, turns this through midwicket gently to pick up a couple more runs;
39.5;1;Plunkett to Voges, 1 run good sharp running again, Voges pushes forward of point and this throw from Bell does hit the stumps at the non-striker's end but the fast Voges makes it home;
39.4;1;Plunkett to Johnson, 1 run he's off the mark now with a flick to midwicket and Prior's throw misses at the striker's end, where Voges was diving and had made his ground in any case;
39.3;?;Plunkett to Johnson, no run defended back down the pitch by Johnson;
39.2;?;Plunkett to Johnson, no run pushed away to point and Johnson can't find a gap;
39.1;W;Plunkett to Hussey, OUT Plunkett strikes! Hussey tries to turn this one to leg but it's bounced a touch more than he expected and lobbed off the shoulder of the bat towards point, where Bell takes a smart catch diving forward;David Hussey c Bell b Plunkett 60 (76m 60b 5x4 1x6) SR: 100;
38.6;1;Wright to Hussey, 1 run really good, quick running as Hussey nudges to short midwicket and takes off - they picked their fieldsman there, as it was Matt Prior;
38.5;1;Wright to Voges, 1 run straight ball from Wright and Voges turns it off his hips through square leg;
38.4;?;Wright to Voges, no run pushed away to cover and Voges can't get a run;
38.3;1;Wright to Hussey, 1 run another whippy clip through midwicket, which is a shot Hussey plays a lot. It's not graceful, but it's effective;
38.2;?;Wright to Hussey, no run Hussey meets this with the full face of the bat, trying for a punchy drive past the bowler but Wright hurls himself to his left to save the run;
38.1;?;Wright to Hussey, no run half a shout for lbw as Hussey plays across the line, trying to work it to leg and the ball lobs off his pad to the off side. Wright didn't go through with the appeal, and that was sliding down leg;
37.6;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run Hussey guides this one wide of the diving gully, shouts "Nooooo!" and then realises it's beaten the fielder, and takes a single;
37.6;1w;Finn to Hussey, 1 wide wrong line and this is called a wide as Hussey doesn't get anything on an attempted glance;
37.5;?;Finn to Hussey, no run defended back down the pitch;
37.4;1;Finn to Voges, 1 run Finn goes a little too straight now and Voges tickles a single down to fine leg;
37.3;?;Finn to Voges, no run straighter line from Finn now and Voges nudges to off, thinks of a quick single, and decides against it;
37.2;4;Finn to Voges, FOUR runs brilliant late cut! Voges played that same shot in the last over for the same result - this one was even crisper, sailing along the turf and beating third man comfortably.;
37.1;?;Finn to Voges, no run Voges clunks a drive into the ground and back to Finn;
36.6;2;Wright to Hussey, 2 runs Hussey goes for the cut now and gets it through point, and that's superb running as they sprint back for two, Hussey narrowly beating a slightly wide throw from Plunkett that is collected by Davies. A better throw and it would have been tight.;
36.5;?;Wright to Hussey, no run better line this time and Hussey defends to the off side;
36.4;1;Wright to Voges, 1 run too straight - Wright needs to get across just a tad outside off - and Voges clips another one through square leg;
36.3;1;Wright to Hussey, 1 run Wright is down leg once more, and Hussey once again tucks a single to fine leg - the scoreboard keeps ticking over;
36.2;?;Wright to Hussey, no run a touch slower from Wright and Hussey can't get it away, a stifled shout as this hits the pads but it was way outside leg;
36.1;1;Wright to Voges, 1 run Wright strays on to the pads too much, and Voges flicks a single down to fine leg;
35.6;1;Finn to Voges, 1 run turned off his pads through square leg again;
35.5;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run tickled down towards fine leg now for another run;
35.4;1;Finn to Voges, 1 run banged in at the hips now and Voges tucks a run through square leg;
35.3;4;Finn to Voges, FOUR runs beautiful cut by Voges! He's waited, cut late and timed it so well that third man can't save it with a sprawling dive to his right, that's a really great stroke;
35.2;1;Finn to Hussey, 1 run cut down into the ground and it runs away past Davies to third man, but is cut off and they can only manage a single;
35.1;?;Finn to Hussey, no run clipped away to leg and can't find a run;
34.6;2;Wright to Voges, 2 runs good stuff from Hussey and Voges here, another quick single pushed to cover - and in fact, that has become two, as England get a bit sloppy and allow an overthrow;
34.5;1;Wright to Hussey, 1 run again too short from Wright, and Hussey pulls to deep midwicket on the bounce;
34.4;3;Wright to Voges, 3 runs lovely cut shot as Wright gives Voges some width, and Yardy running around from third man stops this with his foot - he's obviously not keen on the dive! Good way to break an ankle, though, if you get it wrong;
34.3;2;Wright to Voges, 2 runs lofted over midwicket now and it's just lobbed short of the man in the deep, a chip shot really;
34.2;?;Wright to Voges, no run nudged away defensively by Voges;
34.1;1;Wright to Hussey, 1 run flicked away through square leg;
33.6;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run defended off the front foot, with an inside edge, runs to midwicket to bring up a superb 50;

33.4;?;Yardy to Voges, no run touch of inside edge trickles back to the bowler;
33.3;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run again it's pushed back at the bowler but a diving Yardy can't cut off the single;
33.2;?;Yardy to Hussey, no run defended back to the bowler;
33.1;4;Yardy to Hussey, FOUR runs Yardy finds a good line but some wonderful timing from a forward-push sees the ball racing to the cover boundary. This partnership has been superb;
32.6;1;Wright to Hussey, 1 run pushed to cover for a quick single to finish the over;
32.5;4;Wright to Hussey, FOUR runs french-cut gets the boundary! Nips back, flicks an inside edge that runs past the stumps and past the diving Davies;
32.4;?;Wright to Hussey, no run another slower ball is driven to mid-off;
32.3;?;Wright to Hussey, no run slower ball finds the inside edge of a flowing drive and it runs out to midwicket;
32.2;1;Wright to Voges, 1 run good, bustling back-of-a-length delivery is dropped into the off side for a sharp single;
32.2;1w;Wright to Voges, 1 wide this is shortish and shoved down the leg side;

31.2;?;Yardy to Voges, no run worked again into the leg side but no run;
31.1;2;Yardy to Voges, 2 runs this skews off an inside edge into the midwicket region;
30.6;1;Trott to Voges, 1 run full and straight again and pushed down the ground for a jogged single;
30.5;1;Trott to Hussey, 1 run this time the line is better and it's pushed down the ground;
30.4;4lb;Trott to Hussey, 4 leg byes Trott gets his line wrong again, and it's far too full for Davies to get hold of, flicked off the pad down to the fine leg rope;
30.3;1;Trott to Voges, 1 run this is worked to midwicket again but this time just for one;
30.2;4;Trott to Voges, FOUR runs wow, good timing here, Trott gets his line wrong and it's flicked through midwicket for four;
30.1;1;Trott to Hussey, 1 run quality start from Trott, he's done this slow-medium very well this tour, and it's carefully defended;
29.6;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run Hussey carefully watches this onto the bat and guides it away for a single;
29.5;2;Yardy to Hussey, 2 runs Hussey gets deep in his crease to steer a full ball past cover;
29.4;1;Yardy to Voges, 1 run Yardy trundles in and is milked down the ground;
29.3;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run pushed wide of cover;
29.2;?;Yardy to Hussey, no run full and straight and pushed into the off side;
29.1;1;Yardy to Voges, 1 run Yardy gets his line wrong and is turned around the corner for a single;
28.6;?;Plunkett to Hussey, no run finishes the over with a full and straight ball that is pushed back to the bowler who fields and throws the ball back at the keeper;
28.5;1;Plunkett to Voges, 1 run Plunkett adjusts his line and finds a fuller length, rewarded with an outside edge that runs down to third man;
28.5;1w;Plunkett to Voges, 1 wide banged in short, but too short and it sails way over the batsman;
28.4;?;Plunkett to Voges, no run good delivery here, hugging off stump and it's blocked;
28.3;1;Plunkett to Hussey, 1 run short and legsided again and once again the pull shot isn't timed all that well;
28.2;1;Plunkett to Voges, 1 run short ball and Voges doesn't get much of a pull shot so it trickles away;
28.1;1;Plunkett to Hussey, 1 run Hussey bunts this gently into the legside and Plunkett runs around to field;
28.1;1w;Plunkett to Hussey, 1 wide Plunkett gets his line wrong, shoving this down the leg side;
27.6;4;Yardy to Voges, FOUR runs excellent flick, fine around the corner earns four, really well played;
27.5;?;Yardy to Voges, no run pushed into the on side;
27.4;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run more of a bat on this and it's driven down the ground;
27.3;?;Yardy to Hussey, no run this is a touch leg-sided and clips the pads;
27.2;3;Yardy to Voges, 3 runs Voges down the wicket again and Yardy responded by dropping it shorter, Voges adjusted by cutting very hard to point;
27.1;?;Yardy to Voges, no run Voges wants to have a dart but Yardy is cramping his for room;
26.6;1;Plunkett to Voges, 1 run hint of extra bounce finds the outside edge and flies off down to third man to finish a good over for Australia;
26.5;?;Plunkett to Voges, no run better delivery here - full and straight - and defended back to the bowler;
26.4;1;Plunkett to Hussey, 1 run yikes, Plunkett has lost his line and length completely and it's cut again firmly but this time to deep cover;
26.3;4;Plunkett to Hussey, FOUR runs ah top shot again, Hussey gets a touch of width and crashes this backwards of point;
26.2;?;Plunkett to Hussey, no run fuller and firmly pushed back to the bowler;
26.1;4;Plunkett to Hussey, FOUR runs starts with a decent delivery around off stump but Hussey gets leg-side of the ball and opens the face to guide it to third man for four;
25.6;?;Yardy to Voges, no run a final forward-block to finish the over;
25.5;?;Yardy to Voges, no run more careful defence from the front foot;
25.4;?;Yardy to Voges, no run pushed back to the bowler who fields and aims to throw back at the batsman;
25.3;?;Yardy to Voges, no run wow, Yardy finds turn, actual spin past a dangling outside edge;
25.2;W;Yardy to White, OUT Yardy has another! White tortuous innings ends. White edged down the track but only to bunt this with plenty of inside-edge back to Yardy who gleefully held on to the chance;Cameron White c & b Yardy 24 (70m 47b 1x4 0x6) SR: 51.06;
25.1;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run Yardy darts this into the pads and it's flicked away for an easy single;
24.6;1;Wright to Hussey, 1 run no alarm here, just nudged around the corner;
24.5;?;Wright to Hussey, no run direct hit would have had Hussey out! It was played out to Bell who dived at cover to field smartly, Hussey was still half-way down trying to turn but Bell's throw was well wide;
24.4;1;Wright to White, 1 run touch too leg-sided allows White to turns his hands over the ball;
24.3;?;Wright to White, no run White sits on the back foot and full-faces back to the bowler;
24.2;2;Wright to White, 2 runs short again, the last occasion White timed the ball was a year ago I think, so his attempted pull is spooned over midwicket;
24.1;?;Wright to White, no run Wright finds an off-stump line and it's defended;
23.6;?;Yardy to Hussey, no run defended to finish the over;
23.5;6;Yardy to Hussey, SIX runs bang! Good grief, to paraphrase Mark Nicholas. Yardy was a touch short and this Hussey got deep into his crease and mowed this into the stands over deep midwicket;
23.4;1;Yardy to White, 1 run the sound of time passing slowly - Yardy pushed gently down to long-on;
23.3;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run again it's pushed down the ground for another single;
23.2;1;Yardy to White, 1 run White edges down the wicket and works down the ground;
23.1;?;Yardy to White, no run touch short form Yardy but the late cut finds the fielder;
22.6;?;Wright to Hussey, no run the over finishes with Hussey pushing to cover;
22.5;1;Wright to White, 1 run this time White picks it off into the leg side for another single;
22.4;?;Wright to White, no run again this is shortish and at the body, nudged into the leg side;
22.3;1;Wright to Hussey, 1 run the line drifts a touch to leg and it's worked off the pads for one;
22.2;?;Wright to Hussey, no run fuller and straighter and it's carefully defended;
22.1;1;Wright to White, 1 run ooh, Wright lands this slightly short and the batsman lifted it back towards the bowler who stuck out a hand speculatively but it past him;
22.1;1w;Wright to White, 1 wide adverts interrupted this delivery, so I'm not entirely sure what happened. Send your complaints to the BCCI, who should prevent this from happening;
21.6;1;Yardy to White, 1 run pushed into the off side carefully for a single;
21.5;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run short again and it's pulled with less power for a single;
21.4;2;Yardy to Hussey, 2 runs wonderful fielding from Plunkett on the square leg boundary saves the four, it was firmly pulled from Hussey and deserved four;
21.3;1;Yardy to White, 1 run full toss is carefully pushed down the ground;
21.2;?;Yardy to White, no run this is less flighted but the line is good and White's stiff arms can't work a single;
21.1;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run flight! Flight form Yardy! It's nudged around the corner;
20.6;1;Wright to Hussey, 1 run Hussey celebrates his let-off in typically measured Hussey fashion, working a single behind square on the off side;
20.5;?;Wright to Hussey, no run dropped by Wright, excellent slower ball and Hussey popped it up back to the bowler, they are never easy etc etc, but it should have been taken;
20.4;4;Wright to Hussey, FOUR runs for no good reason Wright imagines he has pace and bangs this in short, he doesn't so it sits up invitingly and Hussey does the necessary, thumping this a long way in front of square for four;
20.3;?;Wright to Hussey, no run left alone outside off stump;
20.2;?;Wright to Hussey, no run more good discipline from Wright and Hussey, another who likes to stand leg-side of the ball, defends to cover;
20.1;1;Wright to White, 1 run White really does hare in, his run up is hilariously quicker than his bowling, the line is good though and it's pushed to mid-on;
19.6;1;Yardy to White, 1 run yet again White is on the paddle-sweep, he's so tall and bulky it makes no sense, but there you go. He gets enough to earn a single around the corner;
19.5;?;Yardy to White, no run more careful defence from White, who has remodelled himself on Boycott;
19.4;W;Yardy to Haddin, OUT smart work from Finn on the long-on boundary sees the end of Haddin! Poor shot really, he just lifted the ball without much intent towards Finn on the boundary, who back-pedalled to take the catch, felt himself about to go over the rope to through the ball up, stepped over before coming back and completing the catch;Brad Haddin c Finn b Yardy 27 (89m 58b 1x4 1x6) SR: 46.55;
19.3;1lb;Yardy to White, 1 leg bye White is the sort of man that could stand tall and smash this out of Perth, instead he gets down apologetically on one-knee and misses a ramp-sweep. Awful that;
19.2;1;Yardy to Haddin, 1 run very short from Yardy, that earns a hint of turn and Haddin has to wait a long, long time to cut to deep point;
19.1;?;Yardy to Haddin, no run starts well enough, straight, no sign of turn and it's pushed back to the bowler;
18.6;1;Wright to Haddin, 1 run Haddin as usual backs away and this gives him the room to steer behind point;
18.5;1;Wright to White, 1 run fullish and straightish and not much the batsman can do but defend;
18.4;1lb;Wright to Haddin, 1 leg bye leg-sided again and it thudded off the pads and trickled into the leg side;
18.4;1w;Wright to Haddin, 1 wide this is slipped down the leg side, and no amount of bright-eyed apology can stop this being a wide;
18.3;?;Wright to Haddin, no run Wright lands another good delivery, following Haddin as he backed away, and it's defended back to the bowler;
18.2;1;Wright to White, 1 run similar delivery to the last and White turns his heavy wrists over the ball to midwicket;
18.1;?;Wright to White, no run starts well, full of bounding enthusiasm and potential incompetence, on middle and defended;
17.6;?;Finn to Haddin, no run left alone outside off stump to finish the over;
17.5;?;Finn to Haddin, no run excellent lines and lengths from Haddin, who seems to wear a permanent smile, or smirk if you're English, defends carefully;
17.4;?;Finn to Haddin, no run quicker this time and it darts past Haddin's attempted back cut;
17.3;?;Finn to Haddin, no run slower ball from the orangeman, who is not Celtic, as far as I know, well directed too and Haddin defends;
17.2;1;Finn to White, 1 run shortish again and White is resolute in defence, pushing square of the wicket;
17.1;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run Finn, who is looking oddly orange today, bangs in a short ball that is dropped into the leg side and Finn hares off after it to field. One of the few people still enthusiastic about this seven-match trudge of a series;
16.6;?;Plunkett to White, no run good finish to the over, Plunkett bangs it in short of a length and White has to stand up to defend uncomfortably;
16.5;1;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run this is turning into a lengthy over but Plunkett hasn't actually bowled that badly and this is pushed to cover for a swift single;
16.5;1w;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide a good short ball that bounces up around off stump is given a wide. It's because bowlers aren't allowed to be threatening in ODI cricket;
16.4;1;Plunkett to White, 1 run Plunkett not following the short-ball plan to White, instead opting for its spiritual opposite - the yorker - which is slightly undercooked and flicked to the leg side;
16.3;1;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run a touch too straight from Plunkett and it's worked around the corner;
16.2;?;Plunkett to Haddin, no run back onto a fine line, hugging off stump and meeting the patient straight bat of Haddin;
16.2;1w;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide oops, shoved down the leg side and Plunkett will have to bowl this again;
16.1;1;Plunkett to White, 1 run Plunkett working up some decent wheels with his horridly clunky action and White manages somehow to squeeze this out to third man, half-guide half-cut shot;
15.6;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Haddin continues his exhibition of self-restraint by drawing his bat inside the line and flagging this through to Davies;
15.5;1;Finn to White, 1 run this is short again and finally White wheels away a stiff-armed pull shot that trickles down to fine leg;
15.4;?;Finn to White, no run another clunked back-foot defence. England like it up at White, who doesn't appear to enjoy it;
15.3;?;Finn to White, no run good lengths and lines for Finn, enjoying the trampoline bounce and White as usual has the most horridly stiff wrists and cannot work the ball in defence;
15.2;1lb;Finn to Haddin, 1 leg bye dropped by Davies! Oh, no, apparently it's a legbye. Top delivery, turned Haddin right around, flicked the back thigh pad and Davies put down the non-chance diving to his right;
15.1;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Finn rams one in back of a length, as has been England's way today, and Haddin as usual skips leg side of the ball to defend on his toes to cover;
14.6;?;Plunkett to White, no run England want a review for an lbw shout that is turned down, but this looked to be angling down leg, if there wasn't an inside edge. Let's see. And yes indeed, that was a big inside edge, so the decision stands. Strange that it was reviewed, as none of the England players really went up for the appeal in a big way;
14.5;?;Plunkett to White, no run nudged away to the off side;
14.4;1;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run oh dear, a top edge now as Haddin goes for the pull, and he's again lucky that this one doesn't carry, it falls short of mid-on;
14.3;?;Plunkett to Haddin, no run Haddin again backs away and tries to swipe it through cover, but it bounces over the stumps and through to Davies;
14.2;1;Plunkett to White, 1 run;
14.1;1;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run flicked away through square leg for a single;
13.6;4;Finn to White, FOUR runs hmmm, a boundary, and pretty well played in the end. White has changed his shot halfway through playing it, shaping to pull and then deciding to guide it uppishly wide of the sole slip and it races away to third-man for a boundary. Second slip could have snaffled that, if there was one.;
13.5;?;Finn to White, no run White defends again and can't get a single;
13.4;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run tucked away off the hips for a single;
13.3;?;Finn to Haddin, no run yet another leading edge, and Haddin is very lucky to get away with this. He's shaped to pull, but then stopped halfway through it and the ball has lobbed off his edge short of point;
13.2;?;Finn to Haddin, no run straighter and angling in a touch, Haddin defends;
13.1;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Finn continues to bowl well, and Haddin can only push it jumpily to gully;
12.6;1lb;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 leg bye angling a touch down leg and Haddin can't get it away properly, just getting one wide of Davies;
12.5;1;Plunkett to White, 1 run pushed gently towards mid-on now and White does get a single this time;
12.4;?;Plunkett to White, no run cracking save by Bell at gully! White lashed this cut into the ground and for all money that looked to have beaten Bell, who hurled himself to his left and just got his hand to it;
12.3;1;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run this time Haddin gets it off the middle, as he tries to thump it over cover, but a man in the deep cuts it off;
12.2;?;Plunkett to Haddin, no run nudges it away towards point and can't find a run;
12.1;?;Plunkett to Haddin, no run again Haddin backs away, as he is wont to do, and it's a swing and a miss;
11.6;?;Finn to White, no run banged in shortish again and White can't get it away;
11.5;?;Finn to White, no run ah, great bouncer as it's well directed and White is in all sorts of bother trying to get away from this - it's whacked the shoulder of the bat, just in front of the helmet;
11.4;?;Finn to White, no run again White nudges to off, no run there;
11.3;?;Finn to White, no run nudged away towards cover and White can't find a gap;
11.2;?;Finn to White, no run this one bounces more, and White defends off the back foot;
11.1;?;Finn to White, no run Finn is banging it in short of a length here but not getting much bounce - White angles the bat and pushes to gully;
10.6;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run ah, nasty delivery now that jags back in and bounces sharply, it flies off the hip - and possibly bat - and lobs safely short of the man at short fine leg;
10.5;1;Anderson to White, 1 run White gets himself off the mark now, glancing a bad ball down leg and Finn at fine leg slides across to save the boundary;
10.4;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run swivels a pull away behind square leg now but this is just a single;
10.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run short of a length again and Haddin defends;
10.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin backs away a little and it's beaten him, through to Davies;
10.1;6;Anderson to Haddin, SIX runs Haddin middles this one! And he's smashed it over mid-off for the first six of the match. What a good stroke, he's cleared the fence and that will give him some confidence;
9.6;?;Finn to White, no run fuller and a little straighter, White defends to mid-on;
9.5;?;Finn to White, no run again Finn is hitting the corridor just on or a touch outside off - White meets it with a straight bat;
9.4;?;Finn to White, no run banged in short of a length now and White defends;
9.3;?;Finn to White, no run Finn aiming to hit the top of off stump here and White defends with a dead bat;
9.2;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run this one's more gently driven down to mid-on and that allows Haddin to hurry a single;
9.1;?;Finn to Haddin, no run full and straight and Haddin meets it with a good on-drive, but straight to mid-on;
8.6;?;Anderson to White, no run banged in at the body and White nudges to leg;
8.5;W;Anderson to Ferguson, OUT Ferguson is gone! Good ball from Anderson as this one bounces sharply outside off and Ferguson fends, and it's well taken high and to the right of Strauss, the only slip in place. Ferguson probably didn't have to play at that bouncer - it wasn't aimed at the body.;Callum Ferguson c Strauss b Anderson 15 (21m 23b 3x4 0x6) SR: 65.21;
8.4;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run again Haddin gives himself room but then just checks his shot and nudges it behind point;
8.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run banged in shorter now and Haddin leaves it alone;
8.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin isn't really middling the ball today, and he's moved across outside leg a touch and tried to force it down the ground, but gets an inside edge into his right leg, in a bit of pain there as it got the unpadded section;
8.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run good probing line outside off and Haddin just defends to point;
7.6;?;Finn to Ferguson, no run fuller and straighter, and Ferguson blocks it;
7.5;4;Finn to Ferguson, FOUR runs and there's another boundary from Ferguson, really good wristy stuff as he flicks one off the leg-stump line through midwicket and it's run all the way along the ground, well timed and placed;
7.4;?;Finn to Ferguson, no run defended back down the pitch;
7.3;4;Finn to Ferguson, FOUR runs Ferguson frees himself up now and gets a much-needed boundary as he backs off a fraction and forces a cut through point, it runs away to the boundary;
7.2;?;Finn to Ferguson, no run another half-volley from Finn, whose run-up is ever so McGrath-like, and Ferguson pushes to mid-off;
7.1;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run he begins with a half-volley that Haddin pushes to cover for a quick single;
6.6;?;Anderson to Ferguson, no run again Ferguson is on the back foot, punching an accurate Anderson delivery to mid-off;
6.5;1lb;Anderson to Haddin, 1 leg bye another one swings away down the leg side, and again it's not put away, Haddin can only get pad on this and it dribbles away to the on side;
6.4;1;Anderson to Ferguson, 1 run quick single now as Ferguson gets on the back foot and punches it to mid-off;
6.3;?;Anderson to Ferguson, no run struck on the pads now as it swings down leg and Ferguson can't get it away;
6.2;?;Anderson to Ferguson, no run banged in a touch shorter now and Ferguson sways out of the way;
6.1;?;Anderson to Ferguson, no run straight-bat defence from Ferguson now as he pushes it back to Anderson;
5.6;1;Plunkett to Ferguson, 1 run clipped away through mid-on and this one finds the gap;
5.5;?;Plunkett to Ferguson, no run banged in at the hips and Ferguson works it to midwicket;
5.4;?;Plunkett to Ferguson, no run solidly defended to the off side now;
5.3;4;Plunkett to Ferguson, FOUR runs good shot from Ferguson as he gets a full and straight one and flicks it confidently through square leg, all the way along the ground for his first boundary;
5.2;?;Plunkett to Ferguson, no run good bounce and carry through to Davies as this one beats the bat of Ferguson;
5.1;?;Plunkett to Ferguson, no run pushed away defensively to the off side;
4.6;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin watchfully defends again - he'd love a big innings going in to the World Cup;
4.5;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run pushed away to the leg side this time;
4.4;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run solidly defended by Haddin, who is one of the few senior players in this Australian side today;
4.3;1lb;Anderson to Ferguson, 1 leg bye swinging down leg there and would have been a wide, but it's slammed into Ferguson's pad and run away for a leg bye;
4.2;?;Anderson to Ferguson, no run full and straight, no swing this time from Anderson, and Ferguson defends;
4.1;?;Anderson to Ferguson, no run on the back foot now, Ferguson punches to mid-off;
3.6;1;Plunkett to Ferguson, 1 run clipped away off the pads for a single to fine leg;
3.5;?;Plunkett to Ferguson, no run straight bat from Ferguson as he pushes it back to Plunkett;
3.4;?;Plunkett to Ferguson, no run defends it away safely;
3.3;W;Plunkett to Paine, OUT ah, now, we have a review that could be for both caught and lbw. Paine was walking down the pitch and tried to flick the ball to leg, it's hit him on the pad and lobbed out to cover, where the catch has been taken. So England want to know if it's either lbw or caught, which Paul Reiffel decides against. The review shows that he was hit in line and it was hitting the stumps, with no edge suggested by Hot Spot. And despite being hit so far down the pitch - he's out lbw!;Tim Paine lbw b Plunkett 5 (16m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 71.42;
3.2;?;Plunkett to Paine, no run ooh, another leading edge this time from Paine as he tries to flick to leg and it lobs safely short of the man at cover;
3.1;?;Plunkett to Paine, no run defended to the leg side;
2.6;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run another one cut straight to point;
2.5;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run a bit of width from Anderson and Haddin cuts hard, but straight to point;
2.4;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run straight-bat defence from Haddin;
2.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run fuller and straighter now and Haddin drives, but can't beat mid-off;
2.2;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin loves that shot! He backs away just a fraction and slams it inside out over cover for the first boundary of the match - a touch risky, perhaps, but he's hit that one well enough;
2.1;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run again Anderson picks up a thick edge, this one from Paine flies through where a fourth slip might have been, and it runs away to third man;
1.6;?;Plunkett to Haddin, no run straighter ball now and it's defended away to the off side;
1.5;?;Plunkett to Haddin, no run punched to mid-off and can't find the gap;
1.5;1w;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide another wide down leg side - both bowlers have battled to get the right line so far today;
1.4;?;Plunkett to Haddin, no run better line now as Plunkett goes just outside off and angles it back in a touch, it's left alone;
1.4;1w;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide wrong line, well down leg side;
1.3;2;Plunkett to Haddin, 2 runs fullish and wide of off, Haddin jams the bat down to drive square through point;
1.2;3;Plunkett to Paine, 3 runs good placement from Paine as Plunkett goes a touch too straight again, Paine just clips it into the gap between midwicket and mid-on, not trying to hit it too hard;
1.1;1;Plunkett to Haddin, 1 run Plunkett begins with a straight ball and Haddin flicks it through midwicket;
0.6;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run banged in at the hips and Haddin gets off the mark with a single worked to square leg;
0.5;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run left alone outside off;
0.4;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run dropped at second slip! Anderson draws a genuine edge from Haddin, Yardy dives across to his left, across in front of Strauss, but grasses the chance. That should have been taken, but it was probably the skipper's catch;
0.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run good ball, swinging away from Haddin, and it goes through to Steve Davies, who has the gloves on instead of Matt Prior;
0.2;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run another one swings down leg but this time Paine clips it through square to get off the mark;
0.2;1w;Anderson to Paine, 1 wide oops, this one goes down leg and doesn't swing back - it's called a wide;
0.1;?;Anderson to Paine, no run full and straight to begin with, Paine defends;

11.20am Right, the players are in the middle and we're ready for the start. It's James Anderson to begin to Tim Paine and Brad Haddin.
I'm Brydon Coverdale and I'll be joined later by Sahil Dutta.
11.10am There's been plenty of anger from fans in Perth at the fact that Australia's best team is not playing this match, and Ian Healy has just launched a stinging attack on the selections on Channel Nine.
"It's not even close to their best side," Healy says. "Michael Clarke gets a couple of 50s under his belt and then he's deemed to be needing a rest. Watson I'll buy - he can have a rest. But I haven't seen Cricket Australia this fragmented for a long time. They've alienated some senior players like Brett Lee and Michael Clarke. They've given the public some ammunition to have another go at Michael Clarke for wanting a rest, even though it was 100% the selectors that did it. They've really robbed the WACA of the best team playing here in Perth at a sellout match. Australian cricket has five coaches in that dressing room and they seem to be very powerless too. I don't know who's pulling the strings on these decisions but it's not synchronised for mine, at all."
Bill emails in: "This is not fair for people in Perth, totally agree with Ian Healy on this one!! Australia will go nowhere if they don't stick with one team for a period of time. This is really disappointing for the Perth crowd."
Meanwhile, if you haven't caught up with the news, Michael Hussey says he's confident he'll make the World Cup but believes he'll struggle to be fully fit for the first couple of matches.
10.50am Cameron White has won the toss in his first ODI as captain and Australia will bat.
For Australia, Brett Lee is being rested and Jason Krejza makes his debut.
Australia 1 Brad Haddin (wk), 2 Tim Paine, 3 Callum Ferguson, 4 Cameron White (capt), 5 David Hussey, 6 Adam Voges, 7 Mitchell Johnson, 8 John Hastings, 9 Jason Krejza, 10 Doug Bollinger, 11 Shaun Tait.
England have also brought in their backup wicketkeeper as a specialist opener, with Steven Davies to join Andrew Strauss at the top of the order. And Liam Plunkett and Luke Wright are in the side.
England 1 Andrew Strauss (capt), 2 Steven Davies, 3 Jonathan Trott, 4 Kevin Pietersen, 5 Ian Bell, 6 Matt Prior (wk), 7 Luke Wright, 8 Michael Yardy, 9 Liam Plunkett, 10 Steven Finn, 11 James Anderson.
10.40am Hello and welcome to the last match in this long Ashes summer, the 7th ODI in Perth, where the weather is, as nearly always, perfect for cricket. Australia have won the series and are fielding a very different looking side captained by Cameron White, but England are also far from full strength. Paul Collingwood has flown home with a back problem and Eoin Morgan is out with a fractured finger.
 Innings Start
So, Australia have won by 57 runs, and they've totally dominated this one-day series. England fly home tomorrow night for a few days with their families before they pack their bags again and head to the World Cup.
Adam Voges is the Man of the Match for his excellent unbeaten 80, a career-best that will ensure he is in the mix should any opportunities arise through injuries to Australian batsmen at the World Cup. Watson is the Player of the Series. And Cameron White begins his ODI captaincy career with a victory.
That's it from a massive summer of international cricket in Australia. Andrew Strauss and his men have lost this series, but they should take a bow for the thrashing that they gave Australia in the Ashes. Andrew McGlashan has been covering this ODI series for us, and his bulletin can be found here.
Thanks for joining us throughout this series, and do tune in again when these two teams begin their World Cup campaigns later this month. On behalf of all the commentators throughout this series - Sahil Dutta, Liam Brickhill and George Binoy - this is Brydon Coverdale signing off.
43.6;W;Hastings to Anderson, OUT there it is! Australia have won this series 6-1 as Hastings bounces Anderson, who tries for a hook but just gets a top edge that flies high in the air and Haddin takes the catch.;James Anderson c ?Haddin b Hastings 4 (14m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;
43.5;4;Hastings to Anderson, FOUR runs this time Anderson finds the gap at point, and that's a lovely cut to get himself off the mark with a boundary;
43.4;?;Hastings to Anderson, no run almost a wicket! Anderson gives himself room and slashes on the up to point, and the ball bounces just short of Tim Paine;
43.3;1;Hastings to Yardy, 1 run Yardy swipes a slog out to deep midwicket on the bounce;
43.2;?;Hastings to Yardy, no run the slower bouncer this time - 102kph, that's almost Yardy's own bowling speed! - and he couldn't get any bat on ball;
43.1;?;Hastings to Yardy, no run slower ball to start with and Yardy punches it to long-off, declining a single;
42.6;?;Tait to Anderson, no run this one sizzles through at 148kph, fortunately for Anderson it was just outside off and he could leave it;
42.5;?;Tait to Anderson, no run Tait goes for the slower ball now, and it's well wide of off, Anderson can't get bat on ball;
42.5;1w;Tait to Anderson, 1 wide banged in at the hips, but a touch too leg-sidey and that's a wide;
42.4;?;Tait to Anderson, no run Tait tries for the yorker but it's well wide of off;
42.3;1;Tait to Yardy, 1 run again Yardy backs away and Tait follows him, he swivels a pull through midwicket;
42.2;?;Tait to Yardy, no run punched away to the off side;
42.1;?;Tait to Yardy, no run Yardy backs away and as a result can't reach this full toss that Tait sprays wide of off;
41.6;?;Bollinger to Anderson, no run good ball, full and straight, but Anderson is good enough to keep it out;
41.5;1lb;Bollinger to Yardy, 1 leg bye slower ball now, and Yardy doesn't pick it, trying to clear the leg side again, and it thumps him in the chest;
41.4;6;Bollinger to Yardy, SIX runs and all of a sudden Yardy has pulled Bollinger for six! What a good shot, he's connected well with this and cleared the rope comfortably, and that's Yardy's highest ODI score;
41.3;4;Bollinger to Yardy, FOUR runs this one is misdirected, down leg and Yardy has managed to get a little tickle on that to get a boundary at fine leg, and that's a good half-century from Yardy;
41.2;2;Bollinger to Yardy, 2 runs oh well played! Yardy has smashed this straight back at the bowler, and Bollinger did well to get his head out of the way, so hard was that struck. He had no chance to get the hands up for a catch, and Krejza at mid-off only just saves it;
41.1;2;Bollinger to Yardy, 2 runs Yardy throws the bat at this pull and gets just enough on it to clear the infield;
40.6;W;Tait to Finn, OUT bowled. Base of middle stump. If Tait got a yorker on line, you just knew Finn was in trouble, and he was backing away and trying to slash it through the off side, but Tait was far too quick.;Steven Finn b Tait 0 (3m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
40.5;?;Tait to Finn, no run wide of off now and Finn breathes a sigh of relief as he's allowed to leave it alone;
40.4;?;Tait to Finn, no run Finn is in now, and he backs away as Tait follows him with a short ball;

40.2;?;Tait to Plunkett, no run Plunket has a slash at one outside off and again it beats the bat;
40.1;?;Tait to Plunkett, no run bouncer, and Plunkett can't get bat on ball;
39.6;?;Bollinger to Yardy, no run Yardy backing away again and Bollinger followed and Yardy couldn't get this away;
39.5;2;Bollinger to Yardy, 2 runs Yardy runs outside leg, then comes back and swishes a couple behind square on the leg side;
39.4;4;Bollinger to Yardy, FOUR runs Yardy lands another blow! Getting back in his crease to smack over third man for four;
39.3;?;Bollinger to Yardy, no run Yardy is backing away again, Bollinger follows him and Yardy had to change his shot to a leg-side smack, which he timed well but straight to mid-on;

39.1;?;Bollinger to Yardy, no run Yardy backs away and aims to cut over third man but misses;

37.6;2;Hastings to Yardy, 2 runs Yardy gets away with another false-shot, he tried to flick this into the midwicket stands but it came off a top edge and looped into space;
37.5;?;Hastings to Yardy, no run shortish and cut straight to backwards point;
37.4;1;Hastings to Plunkett, 1 run slower bouncer comes off the back of the bat and loops down to fine leg;
37.3;2;Hastings to Plunkett, 2 runs very delicate late dab from off stump guides this through first slip. Actually rather well played;
37.2;?;Hastings to Plunkett, no run flash and a miss outside off stump. No real reason for Plunkett to have missed it, but he did;
37.1;?;Hastings to Plunkett, no run good start from Hastings, on a length at off stump and defended to cover;
36.6;?;Hussey to Yardy, no run Yardy down the wicket and Hussey fires it in quicker but Haddin spills the take;
36.5;1;Hussey to Plunkett, 1 run Plunkett on the dab sweep now, completing it far better than Yardy to collect a single;
36.4;1;Hussey to Yardy, 1 run this time Yardy stays up and pushes to cover;
36.3;?;Hussey to Yardy, no run Yardy aims a dab sweep but not for the first time he misses;

35.4;1;Krejza to Plunkett, 1 run attempted sweep shot goes off the top edge and loops safely towards short fine leg;
35.3;?;Krejza to Plunkett, no run some extra spin defeats the attempted defence and it runs off the pads;
35.2;?;Krejza to Plunkett, no run this time he defends carefully;
35.1;6;Krejza to Plunkett, SIX runs Plunkett, like many of us, has had enough and slugs this high over long-on for six;
34.6;?;Hussey to Yardy, no run defended with firm wrists to cover;
34.5;2;Hussey to Yardy, 2 runs Yardy gives himself some room to chop down to deep point;

33.2;?;Krejza to Plunkett, no run fuller here and pushed to mid-on;
33.1;1;Krejza to Yardy, 1 run little bit short here so even with a fraction of spin and back-foot drive through point is easy;
32.6;?;Johnson to Plunkett, no run more swing, late and bending away late, it's through Plunkett, getting a pad on its way through to Haddin. Given out by caught but Plunkett reviewed straight away and it was heading over, so can't be lbw and missed the bat, so can't be caught. Great delivery though, Johnson is a man transformed when he gets to Western Australia;
32.5;?;Johnson to Plunkett, no run this time Plunkett decides he's better off leaving alone. Johnson is bowling rather well here;
32.4;?;Johnson to Plunkett, no run beaten again outside off. Plunkett prods forward and it speeds past the outside edge;
32.3;1;Johnson to Yardy, 1 run more reverse swing at a yorker length this time and Yardy jabs it away;

31.2;?;Krejza to Yardy, no run this is straighter and defended;
31.1;2;Krejza to Yardy, 2 runs Krejza gives this plenty of air, but it's down the leg side and past the keeper and Tait has to give chase;
30.6;1;Johnson to Yardy, 1 run full and tucked around the corner for single;
30.5;?;Johnson to Yardy, no run this is straight and pushed down to mid-on;
30.5;1w;Johnson to Yardy, 1 wide this is down the leg side again, further than the last;

30.4;?;Johnson to Yardy, no run Yardy opts this time to leave alone outside off;
30.3;?;Johnson to Yardy, no run full, straight and crashed into Yardy's pads. It looked very straight by the umpire wasn't interested and the Aussies don't fancy a referral;

29.3;W;Krejza to Wright, OUT Krejza has his second wicket, tossed up outside off stump Wright slashed hard but it looped off the outside edge towards Bollinger who dived forward to short third man to take a tough chance;Luke Wright c Bollinger b Krejza 24 (15m 19b 3x4 0x6) SR: 126.31;
29.2;1;Krejza to Yardy, 1 run short again and cut out to deep point;
29.1;1;Krejza to Wright, 1 run Wright gets deep into his crease to guide a slightly shortish ball wide of cover;
28.6;1;Hussey to Wright, 1 run flat just outside off, Wright taps it softly to point, takes a quick single;
28.5;2;Hussey to Wright, 2 runs some width from Hussey allows Wright to slash backwards of square;
28.4;1;Hussey to Yardy, 1 run this is very straight and turned into the leg side;
28.3;?;Hussey to Yardy, no run touch of air again and pushed to cover;
28.2;?;Hussey to Yardy, no run driven carefully to cover;
28.1;1;Hussey to Wright, 1 run tossed up invitingly and Wright actually times a drive;
27.6;?;Krejza to Yardy, no run defended away to the off side now;
27.5;?;Krejza to Yardy, no run that's a better ball, fuller and drifting in, Yardy plays it from the crease, defending;
27.4;1;Krejza to Wright, 1 run Wright tucks it away behind square leg, again it was too short;
27.3;1;Krejza to Yardy, 1 run nudged away through point again;
27.2;1;Krejza to Wright, 1 run tossed up outside off and turning in, but again it's not full enough, and Wright waits to cut it through cover point;
27.1;1;Krejza to Yardy, 1 run Yardy has time again as Krejza is just a touch too short, and it's cut away safely;
26.6;2;Tait to Wright, 2 runs Tait goes for the slower bouncer, and Wright flays at his free hit, lobbing it up over point but not quite timing it;
26.6;5nb;Tait to Wright, (no ball) horrid delivery from Tait, a full toss down leg side which would have been wide, but worse for Australia it's actually a front-foot no-ball, which means a free hit;
26.5;?;Tait to Wright, no run again it's a bouncer - and at 151kph mind you! Wright did try to slap a pull away but was never quick enough on that shot, and Haddin did well to make the take;
26.4;?;Tait to Wright, no run and Tait responds with a bouncer! Wright wants nothing to do with a well-directed bumper at 145kph, and he ducks it.;
26.3;4;Tait to Wright, FOUR runs lovely shot from Wright as Tait gives him a half-volley, and it's pushed through cover point without much flair but with excellent timing. Good shot.;
26.2;?;Tait to Wright, no run again Wright tries to cut but Tait is just too quick, it's an under edge that dribbles away to slip;
26.1;?;Tait to Wright, no run Wright cuts, and it's well fielded at gully;
25.6;1;Krejza to Wright, 1 run better ball, fuller and outside off, and Wright cuts late;
25.5;4;Krejza to Wright, FOUR runs and again Krejza drags it down, and again Wright's eyes light up and he pulls hard through square leg for another four;
25.4;4;Krejza to Wright, FOUR runs ah, bad ball. Wright latches quickly on to a short one and thumps a pull through square leg for a boundary;
25.3;?;Krejza to Wright, no run oh, a run-out chance goes begging! Wright worked it around the corner to leg, the batsmen took off and then both turned back as Paine got across quickly from short midwicket, but in his dive to the ball Paine has fumbled it and doesn't get his throw away;
25.2;2;Krejza to Wright, 2 runs a bit too short from Krejza, but Wright can only tickle it down the leg side to fine leg;
25.1;W;Krejza to Prior, OUT Krejza has his first ODI wicket! And it comes through a terrific catch from Hussey at cover. Krejza really threw it up and it dropped on Prior, who drove uppishly towards cover and Hussey hurled himself to his right to snare it.;Matt Prior c Hussey b Krejza 39 (62m 51b 3x4 0x6) SR: 76.47;
24.6;?;Hastings to Yardy, no run left alone outside off;
24.5;2;Hastings to Yardy, 2 runs fullish and straight, and Yardy closes the face to work this through midwicket and they pick up two to Paine in the deep;
24.4;1;Hastings to Prior, 1 run half-volley from Hastings, and Prior just steers a drive through cover, happy to tick the scoreboard along with ones and twos;
24.3;?;Hastings to Prior, no run bouncer time, and Prior tries to swipe a hook away but can't connect;
24.2;1;Hastings to Yardy, 1 run Yardy this time finds the gap at cover, just getting himself another single;
24.1;1;Hastings to Prior, 1 run Prior drives comfortably through cover for another single;
23.6;1;Krejza to Prior, 1 run again it's too short, Prior muscles a pull through square leg, but he probably could have done better with that and found a gap;
23.5;1;Krejza to Yardy, 1 run too short, and Yardy has no trouble crunching it through cover;
23.4;?;Krejza to Yardy, no run plenty of air from Krejza, and Yardy advances to make it a full toss, in the end just pushing it back to the bowler;
23.3;1;Krejza to Prior, 1 run Prior clips this with the spin through square leg;
23.2;?;Krejza to Prior, no run defended back to Krejza;
23.1;?;Krejza to Prior, no run ah! That's what happens when you don't get the reverse sweep right. The ball spins too much for Prior, and runs off his forearm up into his helmet;
22.6;?;Hastings to Yardy, no run full and straight, and Yardy defends safely;
22.5;1;Hastings to Prior, 1 run angling on to the pads of Prior, who clips a run through midwicket;
22.4;?;Hastings to Prior, no run driven back to Hastings;
22.3;1;Hastings to Yardy, 1 run Yardy gets away with one now, as he tries to hook Hastings and gets a top edge down to fine leg, it looks as though it may carry to Johnson, but in the end it falls a few metres short of him;
22.2;?;Hastings to Yardy, no run cramps Yardy for room and he misses his attempted cut;
22.1;?;Hastings to Yardy, no run left alone outside off;
21.6;1;Krejza to Yardy, 1 run and again Yardy cuts through the off side with the spin;
21.5;2;Krejza to Yardy, 2 runs ah, just too short from Krejza as he tried to rip this and get a lot of spin, Yardy punches it forward of cover point;
21.4;1;Krejza to Prior, 1 run soft hands from Prior, as he clips it with the spin towards long on;
21.3;2;Krejza to Prior, 2 runs plenty of flight again from Krejza, and a little wide of off, Prior drives hard through cover;
21.2;?;Krejza to Prior, no run tossed up on line and Prior pushes it back to Krejza;
21.1;4;Krejza to Prior, FOUR runs Prior goes for the reverse sweep and he gets it right off the middle of the bat, also getting it fine enough to beat third man;
20.6;1;Hastings to Prior, 1 run on the back foot now, Prior steers it to third man;
20.5;4;Hastings to Prior, FOUR runs an inside edge through the gate now from Prior, who is lucky not to have played on, but instead he picks up a useful boundary;
20.4;1;Hastings to Yardy, 1 run oooh, a run-out chance here as Yardy nudges to off and is slow to react to Prior's call - Hussey from gully collects and throws, but Yardy manages to get his body between the ball and the stumps, so it's hit him on the back of the legs. He might have been short had that got through and hit the stumps;
20.3;1;Hastings to Prior, 1 run good cut from Prior, who gets a single through point;
20.3;1w;Hastings to Prior, 1 wide bouncer a little down leg now and Prior misses his hook - that's called a wide, the indication coming from square-leg for the height of that ball, which was a touch above the head;
20.2;?;Hastings to Prior, no run beaten outside off. Or is it? Hastings appeals enthusiastically, as does the captain White, although Haddin isn't that interested. Prior tried to dab it away and there must have been a noise. Anyway, White wants a review. Hot Spot doesn't seem to have shown anything, and the not-out decision stands.;
20.1;?;Hastings to Prior, no run pushed away to the off side;
19.6;1;Krejza to Prior, 1 run Prior waits on this and plays it late, cutting fine;
19.5;?;Krejza to Prior, no run some spin this time, and Prior gets it off the hip to short fine leg;
19.4;1;Krejza to Yardy, 1 run Yardy punches a single through cover - not a lot of turn for Krejza, he's getting some drift though;
19.3;1;Krejza to Prior, 1 run a paddle away through square leg now;
19.2;2;Krejza to Prior, 2 runs Krejza flights it again and Prior goes for the dab sweep back over his left shoulder, fine leg runs around to field;
19.1;1;Krejza to Yardy, 1 run Krejza is around the wicket to Yardy, drifts it in nicely and Yardy nudges it away to leg;
18.6;1;Tait to Yardy, 1 run banged in short of a length and Yardy uses the pace to steer this one behind gully for a single;
18.6;1w;Tait to Yardy, 1 wide nope, wide ball as Tait sprays this one down leg;
18.5;?;Tait to Yardy, no run Tait goes for the yorker but this one is just outside off, and Yardy doesn't get bat on ball. If Tait gets a yorker on line to Yardy, it could be goodnight.;
18.4;1;Tait to Prior, 1 run Prior does get this one fine enough to beat gully, guiding it off the back foot to third man;
18.3;?;Tait to Prior, no run nudged into the ground and gully does the fielding;
18.2;4;Tait to Prior, FOUR runs lovely shot! Just enough width from Tait, and Prior uses the pace to push a drive through the gap at cover, just timing it and placing it to perfection;
18.1;?;Tait to Prior, no run another ripping yorker and it's right on line, but again Prior is good enough to keep it out;
17.6;?;Hastings to Yardy, no run Yardy leans in to an off-drive and can't find a gap at mid-off;
17.6;1w;Hastings to Yardy, 1 wide wrong line, down leg and Asad Rauf calls that a wide;
17.5;1;Hastings to Prior, 1 run Prior won't mind a bouncer from Hastings, who isn't that quick, and he hooks it on the bounce to deep square leg;
17.4;1lb;Hastings to Yardy, 1 leg bye struck on the pads on leg stump and half a shout for lbw from Hastings, but that must certainly have pitched outside leg;
17.3;?;Hastings to Yardy, no run beaten outside off as Yardy tries to push at a ball that angles across him;
17.2;1;Hastings to Prior, 1 run and again Prior punches a cover drive through the gap, but hits this one too well and can only get a single;
17.1;2;Hastings to Prior, 2 runs fullish from Hastings and wide of off, Prior drives uppishly through cover to Ferguson, who is sweeping the boundary;
16.6;?;Tait to Yardy, no run Yardy goes for the dab cut now and finds point;
16.5;1;Tait to Prior, 1 run soft hands from Prior as he pushes a single to the leg side;
16.4;1;Tait to Yardy, 1 run on the stumps again and Yardy nudges a single to midwicket;
16.3;1;Tait to Prior, 1 run fast and straight again, and Prior punches a square drive through point;
16.2;?;Tait to Prior, no run beautiful yorker! Quick and straight, but Prior is up to the task and jams it out, nearly falling over himself in doing so, but he survives;
16.1;1;Tait to Yardy, 1 run Yardy is greeted with a Tait bouncer, and does well to fend it to fine leg for a single;
15.6;?;Hastings to Prior, no run Prior goes for the cut, and can't beat point;
15.6;1w;Hastings to Prior, 1 wide the slower bouncer now from Hastings, but it's also the wider bouncer - way outside off;
15.5;?;Hastings to Prior, no run the lack of pace fools Prior here as he tries to punch a cover-drive off the back foot, can only get another bottom edge down to his feet;
15.4;1;Hastings to Yardy, 1 run clipped off the pads for a single behind square, and Yardy's off the mark;
15.3;1;Hastings to Prior, 1 run banged in short and Prior goes for the hook, Paul Reiffel at square leg ducks with admirable agility, and that's collected out in the deep;
15.2;?;Hastings to Prior, no run ah, a bottom edge now runs on to the pad, and he's lucky it didn't then run on to the stumps;
15.1;?;Hastings to Prior, no run defended back down the pitch;
14.6;1;Johnson to Prior, 1 run finally Prior gets one away, standing tall to steer to third man;
14.5;?;Johnson to Prior, no run Prior is more solidly behind this one;
14.4;?;Johnson to Prior, no run Prior is beaten outside off stump, dangling his bat as it angles past the bat;
14.3;?;Johnson to Prior, no run another solid and sturdy defence from Prior;
14.2;?;Johnson to Prior, no run this is pushed out into the covers;
14.1;W;Johnson to Bell, OUT Johnson gets another, Bell's tour ends. Upper cut to a wide ball straight down to third man who held the simplest of catches. England are heading for the early plane;Ian Bell c Tait b Johnson 8 (24m 16b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50;

12.6;?;Johnson to Bell, no run left alone outside off stump to end the over;
12.5;?;Johnson to Bell, no run banged in shorter, much shorter, it was down the legside but not given a wide;
12.5;1w;Johnson to Bell, 1 wide some rare amusement for the few England fans at the ground as Johnson slings this miles past off;

12.3;1;Johnson to Prior, 1 run Prior nudges a single to square leg;
12.2;?;Johnson to Prior, no run this is very straight but a touch shorter and Prior steers a defence to point;

11.6;?;Hastings to Bell, no run Bell lunges forward to a full and straight ball to defend;

11.1;?;Hastings to Bell, no run starts outside off stump and Bell shoulders arms;
10.6;?;Johnson to Prior, no run Matt Prior keeps his first ball out by patting to point;
10.5;W;Johnson to Pietersen, OUT that ends a pretty dreadful innings. Another wide ball full outside off and sliced straight to point. Pietersen's tour ends and it feels like half of him was home already;Kevin Pietersen c Krejza b Johnson 26 (45m 31b 3x4 0x6) SR: 83.87;
10.4;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run wider and fuller and Pietersen toe-ends a drive to mid-off. This is quite a struggle;
10.3;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run oh dear, this is a full ball that Pietersen aims a pull at, through him in a flash;
10.2;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run left alone! That's the first sensible shot outside off from Pietersen I can remember;
10.1;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run straighter this time and Pietersen stands tall to defend conventionally;
10.1;1w;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 wide very full, very wide, Pietersen grunted as he tried to reach it with a flat-footed swish;
9.6;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run again Bollinger is very straight and Bell can do nothing but defend;
9.5;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run this time Bollinger is straighter and Bell defends with the straightest of blades;
9.4;4;Bollinger to Bell, FOUR runs just a hint of width and Bell times an elegant cut shot that speeds to the point boundary;
9.3;1;Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run fuller ball to Pietersen, who has calmed down a wee bit after a frantic start, and drives to mid-off;
9.2;1;Bollinger to Bell, 1 run Bell gets a shorter ball that he pulls gently down to fine leg;
9.1;1;Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen fiddles this off his pads around the corner for a single to bring the new batsman Ian Bell on strike;
8.6;W;Johnson to Trott, OUT Trott departs! Length ball outside off stump, Trott aimed another dab but the edge went through to Hussey at slip. The tour is ending swiftly;Jonathan Trott c Hussey b Johnson 14 (45m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 63.63;

7.3;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run shorter this time but Pietersen was advancing and he has to get on his toes to defend;
7.2;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run this is straighter and fuller and Pietersen defends;
7.1;4;Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs short and Pietersen climbed into a pull shot, got most of it and it flew out one-bounce to the midwicket rope;
6.6;?;Johnson to Trott, no run Trott aims a cut shot that finds point, they batsmen went for a single and if Paine had hit, Trott, who had to turn back in a hurry would have gone;
6.5;4;Johnson to Trott, FOUR runs ah, fuller and the width Trott needs to stroke past point, with plenty of timing and it runs away for four;
6.4;?;Johnson to Trott, no run banged in short, short enough to be called a bouncer, but not a wide;
6.3;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run fuller this time and driven without much timing down the ground for a gentle single. Calmer shot from Pietersen;

4.6;4;Tait to Pietersen, FOUR runs ah, full half-volley on leg stump and Pietersen clips it powerfully wide of mid-on for four;
4.5;?;Tait to Pietersen, no run Pietersen is playing like a millionaire. He's having a bash at absolutely everything. Again he's missed it, clever slower ball dribbled through to Haddin;
4.4;4;Tait to Pietersen, FOUR runs close enough for Pietersen this time to smash a widish offside delivery for four through cover;
4.4;1w;Tait to Pietersen, 1 wide wide, wide, wide, wide. Short and outside off this time. Pietersen ended up hopping on one leg to aim a swish to off but couldn't reach it;
4.4;1w;Tait to Pietersen, 1 wide this is yet another wide, banged in short and down the leg side. Pietersen had an almighty thwack but missed;

3.6;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run ah, there's the silly shot, Pietersen walks across his stumps and aims a swish to the midwicket boundary. He missed and it crashed into the body. I suppose if he nailed it, it would have been a great shot;
3.5;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run after all that alarm last delivery Pietersen decides to leave this alone outside off;
3.4;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run ooh, good ball, nipped back from a length as Pietersen lunged forward and crashed into the elbow of the bottom arm;
3.3;1;Bollinger to Trott, 1 run Trott without fuss picks up a single dabbing into the midwicket region;
3.2;1;Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run fuller and straighter and carefully blocked, the inside edge carries it around the corner for one;
3.1;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run left alone outside off stump this time, but it's close enough to off stump to prevent a wide;
3.1;1w;Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 wide good lord, another wide. Bollinger bangs this in short of a length and down the leg side;
2.6;?;Tait to Trott, no run good delivery here to finish the over, fullish and swinging away. Solidly blocked to mid-off;
2.5;?;Tait to Trott, no run variation straight delivery, very straight and full and had Trott stuck on the back foot;
2.5;1w;Tait to Trott, 1 wide it's another wide, slung down the leg side;
2.5;1w;Tait to Trott, 1 wide pace and width draws Trott into a flat-footed waft outside off which he misses;
2.4;?;Tait to Trott, no run very good length and line and Trott defends under his eyes;
2.3;?;Tait to Trott, no run slower ball this time, Trott happily pats it to midwicket. Full toss in the end perhaps Trott should have done more with it;
2.3;1w;Tait to Trott, 1 wide shoved down the leg side this time. Quick though;
2.2;1;Tait to Pietersen, 1 run very sharp swinging full ball that Pietersen toe-ended square of the wicket;
2.1;?;Tait to Pietersen, no run Pietersen gets a bouncer first ball that whistles past the nose;
1.6;W;Bollinger to Davies, OUT that is a miserable ending to a poor innings. Length ball and Davies was sitting on the back foot, aimed a swish across the line and the top edge sailed up and Haddin did the rest. This might end quickly;Steven Davies c ?Haddin b Bollinger 0 (12m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
1.5;?;Bollinger to Davies, no run Davies gets bat on ball, without much timing, driven to cover;
1.4;?;Bollinger to Davies, no run this is shorter and moved away off the seam and left alone;
1.4;1w;Bollinger to Davies, 1 wide touch of swing here, from the bowler and from the batsman, who aimed an airy drive and missed it. This was given a wide, which is a touch harsh;
1.3;?;Bollinger to Davies, no run this is dug in very short indeed and it leaps past Davies who left alone. No wide given;
1.2;1lb;Bollinger to Trott, 1 leg bye Trott shuffles across his stumps and a short ball is flicked off the hip to fine leg;
1.1;?;Bollinger to Trott, no run Bollinger starts well enough outside off stump that is left all alone;
0.6;?;Tait to Davies, no run touch shorter this time and Davies sways inside the line to flag it through to Haddin;
0.5;?;Tait to Davies, no run ooh, Davies has been out of the game for a while and this was a sleepy drive outside off that swung back between bat and pad;
0.5;1w;Tait to Davies, 1 wide Davies watches his first ball go down the leg side;
0.4;1;Tait to Trott, 1 run Trott opens the face and steers this past point for a jogged single;
0.4;1w;Tait to Trott, 1 wide and this is slung too wide of off. Guess that will happen with him every now and then;
0.3;?;Tait to Trott, no run fired in a touch shorter and Trott shuffles across his stumps to drop to leg;
0.2;W;Tait to Strauss, OUT have that! Tait strikes with a thunderbolt! Strauss hung back to a full ball and was still half-way through his defensive prod when the inswinger pegged back the top of off stump;Andrew Strauss b Tait 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
0.1;?;Tait to Strauss, no run whoosh, Tait starts very quickly and it's left alone outside off stump;

Right, no time for dawdling the innings is about to start again. Tait to Strauss. England have Davies opening, would they want him to crack a century? Would make the selectors look plenty silly.
