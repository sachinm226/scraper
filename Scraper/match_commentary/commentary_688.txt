Data
Australia fight back well to keep Sri Lanka down to 226 inside 50 overs, nipping out seven wickets for 69 runs at the end. They do come hard at you, these Australians. Jayawardene and Silva forged a 140-run fourth-wicket stand to lift Sri Lanka, but Australia will fancy themselves to chase down 227 with an attack missing Vaas, Malinga and Murali. Do join me in about 40 minutes - 13:40 local, 17:40 GMT - for the second innings.

Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the 43rd match of this year's World Cup. This Is Jamie Alter, and you've tuned in to what promises to be a cracker, Australia v Sri Lanka in Grenada.
Some clouds overhead, but otherwise lovely blue skies, the ground bathed in sunshine. A good crowd building up. Great setting for a day of cricket on the green.
Pitch report:
Last time we had a game on this surface, there were overcast conditions. Today its even, with just a couple rough areas, no cracks or flakes. Basically, no worries for the batsmen. Should assist the spinners as the day progresses.
The toss:
Ricky Ponting flipped, Mahela Jayawardene called heads, won, and decided to have a bat. He wants to make first use of the pitch. Surprise, surprise, Sri Lanka have rested Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan. Maybe expected, as both teams have already qualified for the semis? Im pretty surprised. Australia have recalled Nathan Bracken in place of Stuart Clark. There are other two noticeable absences in both sides today. Shane Watson (calf) is out for Australia, while Sri Lanka are missing Lasith Malinga (ankle).
The Scenario:
Both sides are secured in the semi-finals, so that isn't a factor today. In fact, many have tipped these two teams as finalists, but even without that presumption these two are always fun to watch. Australia are on a roll - the World Cup holders have not lost since Pakistan beat them by 10 runs at Headingley in May 1999. To put that in perspective, that 24 wins and a tie since then. Sri Lanka, though, are in some form, and have the best bowling attack in the tournament. They're superb in the field, like Australia, and have the explosive Sanath Jayasuriya up the top, enjoying a great run. Sri Lanka will look to dislodge the opening duo of Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden.
Ricky Ponting hasnt looked like getting out all tournament, and you can never count him out. Glenn McGrath is in the wickets; in fact, he leads the tally in the competition. Shaun Tait has been a real find for Australia, too. Two exciting sides, with super players both.
As we wait for the game to begin, feel free to peruse Andrew Miller's preview.
Vital stat:
Australia have won 41 of the 62 one-day clashes between the sides and four out of five at previous World Cups. They lost, you'll all remember, in the finals of the 1996 edition at Lahore, a win that really put Sri Lanka on the map.
Captain speak
Mahela Jayawardene: "It's an ideal time to play them because we are very relaxed. It is an important game for us, but I don't think it's that important for us to risk Lasith [Malinga] if he is not 100%. We've got guys who can step up to the plate and deliver for us, so I'm not very concerned about his fitness right now."
Ricky Ponting: "Our plan will be to get through the new ball as well as we can and keep wickets in hand for the middle part of the game when they slow things down with their spinners, Murali, Sanath Jayasuriya and Tillakaratne Dilshan."
As we wait for matters to get underway, let me remind you that you can now watch an animated representation of our commentary on Cricinfo 3D. It uses all our scoring data to render a 3d representation of the game, with various camera angles for you to play around with, and it has features such as wagon wheels, pitch maps, and the live scorecard. There are also replays after every wicket and boundary on demand, as well as celebrations for wickets. Yes, yes, it's free. Don't be shy to click away.
Ah, yes, another bit of fun for you all - a host of downloadable stuff for you.
 Innings Start
Australia just too good for anyone. Not one team has bothered them all tournament. You're going to need a lot to beat this team, A-game, B-game, call if what you will. Dismissed Sri Lanka cheaply, knocked off the runs without breaking a sweat, and I want to see what team beats Australia.
Do join us for tomorrow's much-hyped affair, England v South Africa at Bridgetown, at 13:30 GMT. Thats all from me, Jamie Alter. Good night/morning/evening/afternoon, wherever you may be. Cheers!
