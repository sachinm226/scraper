Data
1.07pm Mitchell Marsh: [Feeling] not too bad. I have to give myself a chance, I like to hang around a bit and have a go at the end. I'm happy to be contributing to the team as a youngster and keep going. Pitch is not turning as much. We'll look to start well with early wickets and hopefully we'll get a win today.
That man has taken Australia to a very good score on this pitch. It's a bit slow but not turning much, like Marsh said. Australia scored 101 in the last 10 overs, all thanks to Marsh's unbeaten 86. They were going steady till about 150, led by Hughes' fifty but the Powerplay hurt their progress and were in trouble. But Marsh turned it around in their favour and has given himself and other bowlers a good score to defend. Be back in 40 minutes for the chase

 Innings Start
Presentation time:
AB de Villiers: Looked like we didn't compete, that's most disappointing. Having won the toss we thought we'd put in a competitive game. Felt good during the first 40 overs, especially the spinners. But Mitchell played very well and it showed the pitch got better for batting once you spent some time there. We were found wanting in the slog overs, he deserves credit for what he pulled off there and batsmen are getting really dangerous these days. We were poor in patches. I'm not worried about the middle order. Disappointed that we lost too many wickets, including mine, at the wrong time. And we'll have to ask our batsmen to bat for longer. One of the best hundreds I've seen in a very long time, from Faf, proud of the way he batted for his incredible knock and he has cemented his No. 3 spot.
George Bailey: Very happy today. Luckily some great hitting form Marsh helped us put up a pretty competitive score. We were probably near the par total. We lost Hughes and myself at key times and Marsh got us to a big total. Early wickets are important on these wickets, and Maxwell got us the first one. Faf's in unbelievable form and I was impressed with our energy and our players did the right thing at the right times. We got to get better with adjusting to conditions and we are looking forward to the final.
Mitchell Marsh is Man of the Match: Very happy and hopefully I can keep things going like this. On this wicket you need to put in some time to bat big at the end.
That's all we have for you today, so Zimbabwe can still make it to the final. Do join us for that match on Thursday when they play South Africa for a bonus-point win. It's goodbye from Vishal, ta ta!
4.50pm A bonus-point win means Australia have made it to the series final, despite losing to Zimbabwe a couple of days ago. They were jittery today as well but Hughes and Marsh charged them to a very competitive score on this pitch. Their bowlers never allowed South Africa to get on top. No batsman could even score 25, barring du Plessis who ran out of partners before falling for 126. Most of their bowlers chipped in and when it looked like McLaren was giving them a chance with du Plessis, Johnson broke the stand and took it away. It means Zimbabwe still have a theoretical chance to make it to the final, with a massive bonus-point win, in their last league game against South Africa. Presentation coming soon

11.6;?;Marsh to du Plessis, no run full ball outside off, Faf considers whether to whack this as well, then let's it goo;
11.5;6;Marsh to du Plessis, SIX runs and a repeat from Faf, this is another outstanding hit, takes a couple of steps down the track, gets near the pitch, lofts this over mid-off for six, again the exaggerated lift of the back foot, this isn't the most quickest of surfaces, which allows for this sort of shot;
11.4;1;Marsh to de Villiers, 1 run dinked towards third man for a single;

9.3;W;Marsh to Amla, OUT stunning take from Haddin, throwing himself to his left to pluck a one-handed take, not bad for a 36-year-old that, Amla had moved across the stumps to try whip the ball down to fine leg, can only tickle it just wide of Haddin, or so he thought till that acrobatic leap from Haddin, and Marsh's day continues to get better;Hashim Amla c ?Haddin b Marsh 17 (42m 28b 2x4 0x6) SR: 60.71;
