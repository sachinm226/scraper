And Langer comes out for the last time to a great reception, with Hayden allowing him to walk a few yards ahead. Flintoff with the new ball at the Paddington End.
We've had many emails asking what lbg stands for after Warne's name. It means he's a legbreak bowler. Our anoraks insists that's the way it is, and trust me, you don't want to take them on
A good morning for Australia who mopped things up well, and had it not been for a spirited 89 from Andrew Flintoff - and some poor catching - then England would be in a real pickle once more. We will now have one over before lunch ... we think. More in a second.
103.4;W;Warne to Panesar, OUT Panesar picks the wrong ball to sweep, it started on off stump and never moved, he missed it and Aleem Dar had a simple decision to make. It's Warne's 1000th international wicket but the celebrations are so muted as to be almost non existent ... a handshake from his colleagues and a half smile from the man himself;Monty Panesar lbw b Warne 0 (20m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
103.3;?;Warne to Panesar, no run Warne trying to lure Panesar with flighted balls outside the off stump;
103.2;?;Warne to Panesar, no run text book defensive shot;
103.1;?;Warne to Panesar, no run flighted, driven on the up and a good sprawling stop at mid-off by Symonds;
102.6;?;Clark to Anderson, no run Anderson back, blocks and Clark grimaces as he knows he should have tested him more with those five balls;
102.5;?;Clark to Anderson, no run angled in and Anderson opens the face and steers it to Langer in the slips;
102.4;?;Clark to Anderson, no run less theatrics as the ball was wider and Anderson just watched it fly by;
102.3;?;Clark to Anderson, no run a flamboyant leave;
102.2;?;Clark to Anderson, no run Anderson manages to get enough bat on that, but this will be brief you suspect;
102.1;W;Clark to Flintoff, OUT Flintoff takes two strides down the pitch and aims to thump the ball over extra cover, gets a thick edge and Glichrist holds a good catch diving high to his right. Flintoff slowly heads off as the SCG stands to recognise a fine innings ... and it's five catches for Gilchrist;Andrew Flintoff c ?Gilchrist b Clark 89 (195m 142b 11x4 1x6) SR: 62.67;
101.6;?;Warne to Panesar, no run legbreak, but off line and it drifts down the leg side;
101.5;?;Warne to Panesar, no run driven to mid-off, another cheer;
101.4;?;Warne to Panesar, no run slightly wider, Panesar gropes and almost chases it into Gilchrist's gloves;
101.3;?;Warne to Panesar, no run looped up outside off stump, blocked, and the crowd cheer and give a round of applause;
101.2;1;Warne to Flintoff, 1 run leg side, Flintoff sweeps and this time takes the run as it goes to long leg;
101.1;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run straight and Flintoff blocks. "Bowled Warny," chirps Gilchrist;
100.6;?;Clark to Panesar, no run leg side and Panesar gets inside the line;
100.5;?;Clark to Panesar, no run driven with a bit more certainty this time;
100.4;?;Clark to Panesar, no run Dropped! Fuller and Panesar drives, the edge flies to Langer at third slip and for the third time he drops one there. He took off his hat and threw it in the air in disgust - but managed to catch it, at least ... his mind seems anywhere but in the middle and he buries his head in his hands ..;
100.3;?;Clark to Panesar, no run again short, and once more Panesar stays tall, gets right over the ball and drops it at his feet;
100.2;?;Clark to Panesar, no run short, Panesar stands tall and steers into the gully and then gives his captain at the other end a big grin;
100.1;?;Clark to Panesar, no run hello and welcome ... Panesar gets a decent bouncer and bends low to preserve his well being;
7.6;?;Lee to Strauss, no run angled away from Strauss and Gilchrist moves some way to the off to take it;
7.5;?;Lee to Strauss, no run into line, solidly behind it even thought he is turned a bit square;
7.4;?;Lee to Strauss, no run Strauss drops his wrists and lets it go;
7.3;3;Lee to Cook, 3 runs punched straight drive, within inches of the stumps at the bowler's end, and Symonds catches it just inside the rope;
7.2;?;Lee to Cook, no run seamed across the left hander and beat Cook all ends up ... that moved some way, too far;
7.1;?;Lee to Cook, no run angled away from the left hander, Cook goes on the back foot and defends it on the off;
6.6;?;McGrath to Strauss, no run decent line, met with the full face of the bat;
6.5;1;McGrath to Cook, 1 run and again leg side, Cook turns it to the man in the deep;
6.4;?;McGrath to Cook, no run Cook into line and blocks;
6.3;3;McGrath to Strauss, 3 runs even better shot, punched off the back foot through the covers;
6.2;2;McGrath to Strauss, 2 runs again full on leg stump and Strauss, who enjoys that shot, clips it into the deep and gets two with some nippy running;
6.1;?;McGrath to Strauss, no run short, Strauss pulls out of the hook and lets it pass;
99.6;4;Warne to Flintoff, FOUR runs low full toss and Flintoff drives through the ball on the on-side, his bottom hand leaving the bat with the effort. Despairing cry of "catch" but it was several feet over the fielder's head;
99.5;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run punched into the off side;
99.4;2;Warne to Flintoff, 2 runs short, Flintoff waits and smacks that through the off side, lovely placement again between the men in the deep;
99.3;2lb;Warne to Flintoff, 2 leg byes down the leg, turned off the pads which takes the pace off the ball and means there's a two to the fielder in the deep who has some way to run in;
99.2;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run grunts and gasps from Warne as Flintoff plays and misses;
99.1;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run full, turned to leg. No run and the cat-and-mouse game resumes;
98.6;W;Clark to Harmison, OUT yorker, Harmison shapes to turn to leg but misses, the ball hits him on the full and no doubts with Bowden's decision ... that was going on to hit a third of the way up middle and leg;Steve Harmison lbw b Clark 2 (51m 24b 0x4 0x6) SR: 8.33;
98.5;1;Clark to Flintoff, 1 run he opens the face and runs it to point, Harmison comes immediately, Flintoff hesitates and has to scurry to beat the shy at the bowler's end;
98.4;2;Clark to Flintoff, 2 runs steered down to third man where Langer makes a good tumbling stop, but he had ground to make up and that's another easy two;
98.3;2;Clark to Flintoff, 2 runs Flintoff deliberately opens the face and runs the ball finer through third slip, sets off for the single and yells "push" and they scurry back for the second;
98.2;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run turned backward of point, again the single declined;
98.1;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run thumped to cow corner, fielded in the deep but the run declined;
97.6;?;Warne to Harmison, no run full, hits Harmison on the toe ... Warne appeals, Aleem Dar turns away and heads for square leg, leaving Warne scowling mid pitch. It pitched outside the leg-stump line;
97.5;1;Warne to Flintoff, 1 run driven up to long-on again, but just the one this time with only one ball remaining;
97.4;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run plopped into the leg side;
97.3;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run Flintoff stretches forward and blocks;
97.2;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run loud shout for leg-before, pitched outside leg but Warne had walked across the umpire's line so Aleem Dar couldn't have seen anyhow;
97.1;2;Warne to Flintoff, 2 runs No more than jabbed into the leg side, but past the close man and with no pace, there is two to long-on. Hamrison has to throw himself at the non-striker's crease as the ball is fired in, but he would have been OK;
96.6;?;Clark to Harmison, no run into line and stroked into the covers;
96.5;?;Clark to Harmison, no run Harmison shapes to leave the ball but his reactions are a little slow and he ends up steering it - along the ground - to fourth slip;
96.4;?;Clark to Harmison, no run better from the batsman, got behind that with more confidence;
96.3;?;Clark to Harmison, no run lovely ball ... right through Harmison's indecisive prod;
96.2;?;Clark to Harmison, no run Watchful defence from Harmison ... how long will he keep this up;
96.1;?;Clark to Harmison, no run Clark scurries in and pushes Harmison onto the back foot;
95.6;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run another bouncer, ultra short, with the sole aim of keeping Flintoff down the blunt end for the start of the next over;
95.5;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run really wide of off stump and a leaden-footed Flintoff swishes and misses, looking rather sheepish about the amateurishness of the stroke;
95.4;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run short,a super slow-motion bouncer at 78mph (125.5kph) and it barely crawls into Gilchrist's gloves;
95.3;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run smacked to long-off, no run again;
95.2;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run driven firmly to extra cover who makes a complete sow's ear of stopping it. Normally there would be a single there but Flintoff is keeping the strike and so nothing doing;
95.1;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run straight, circumspect defence, all a bit low key;
94.6;?;Clark to Harmison, no run solid defence;
94.5;1;Clark to Flintoff, 1 run another drive, this time through mid-off and it's picked up tidily by Symonds inside the rope;
94.4;2;Clark to Flintoff, 2 runs driven forcefully off his hips out to cow corner for an easy two;
94.3;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run on the front foot;
94.2;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run defended on the back foot;
94.1;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run driven out to long-on;
93.6;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run pushed up there and defended forward;
93.5;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run that one flies through to the keeper;
93.4;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run more shouldering - that one was wider this time;
93.3;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run shoulders arms to that one which nips back in at him on the rise;
93.2;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run swings that one away down the corridor and like some orange-and-purple socks in a New Year sale, it's left well alone;
93.1;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run defended forward;
92.6;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run good response - a bouncer, and that's ducked;
92.5;4;Lee to Flintoff, FOUR runs love that one, a glorious straight drive to a straight delivery and that's just creamed away, eluding Lee's despairing right hand;
92.4;4;Lee to Flintoff, FOUR runs stands tall again and delivers a cracking drive off the back foot through the covers, four all the way;
92.3;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run stands tall and drives well to cover;
92.2;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run bouncer, ducked under;
92.1;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run pushed right up there, in front of off, and that's defended on the front foot;
91.6;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run defended;
91.5;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run outside edge flies low to a wideish third man;
91.4;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run left alone outside off;
91.3;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run solid defending off the back foot;
91.2;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run quietly nudged to square, there was a run on, an easy one, but he chose to keep the strike. Boos from the crowd, but Flintoff's being sensible there;
91.1;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run left alone outside off;
90.6;?;Lee to Harmison, no run past the outside edge once more;
90.5;?;Lee to Harmison, no run beautifully bowled once more, just outside the off stump and it's too good for Harmison who can't get anything, not even an edge, on it;
90.4;?;Lee to Harmison, no run big call for LBW, turned down. Harmison hadn't got too far forward there but Bowden said no.;
90.3;2;Lee to Harmison, 2 runs Harmison tucks that one away off his toes and manages to get two - England would have loved the three, there, but it wasn't to be;
90.2;1;Lee to Flintoff, 1 run pushed up and that's defended on the front foot, with the batsmen choosing a single again. Lee smiling as he walks back to his mark; he's enjoying himself out there - and now he's got the chance to have a dart at Harmison;
90.1;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run ah. Spears that one wide, an anti-climax, but there are big cheers anyway;
89.6;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run Harmison steps over to that one, which is in the corridor, and decides to leave it;
89.5;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run oh, back of a length delivery and Harmison stabs at it, missing;
89.4;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run left alone again;
89.3;?;McGrath to Harmison, no run Harmison leaves that one, which arcs invitingly past his outside edge, and then rehearses his leave;
89.2;1lb;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 leg bye defended this time but the batsmen choose to take the single anyway, exposing Harmison to McGrath;
89.1;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run bouncer and Flintoff ducks under it;
88.6;W;Lee to Mahmood, OUT Lee's on a hat-trick, Mahmood has no idea where that's gone - to Hayden at gully as it happens. Top stuff from Lee again - hostile and England have no answers to either him or McGrath;Sajid Mahmood c Hayden b Lee 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
88.5;W;Lee to Read, OUT no hiding place this time and he's gone! That one was too good, too fast and Read can't control it, flashing an edge through off the back foot. He could have left it, as it happened, given the ball swung away but it was all over with very quickly.;Chris Read c ?Gilchrist b Lee 2 (13m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22;
88.4;2;Lee to Read, 2 runs a huge appeal for lbw for one which keeps low but he got an inside edge on it, a real sliver of an edge which just saves him - although, actually, height may have been a factor, there, too;
88.3;?;Lee to Read, no run left alone outside off;
88.2;1;Lee to Flintoff, 1 run straighter, good response, and Flintoff squares up to that one with a straight bat and they manage a single;
88.1;4;Lee to Flintoff, FOUR runs a touch of width and that's a crunching shot off the back foot which goes just behind point;
87.6;?;McGrath to Read, no run fired right up there on a good length and that's defended forward;
87.5;?;McGrath to Read, no run fired in and the ball bobbles up off his bat;
87.4;?;McGrath to Read, no run worked in front of square;
87.3;?;McGrath to Read, no run left alone outside off;
87.2;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run jams his bat down on it at the last minute and they squeeze out a run;
87.1;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run that one swings violently away from the right hander who chooses to leave it - anything else would have been fishing madness;
86.6;?;Lee to Read, no run a touch wider than Lee would have liked and that's left alone easily;
86.5;?;Lee to Read, no run defended on the back foot;
86.4;1;Lee to Flintoff, 1 run jabbed down off the back foot into the covers;
86.3;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run airy swish this time;
86.2;4;Lee to Flintoff, FOUR runs short and Flintoff waits for it, angling it straight down into the ground and it races past gully;
86.1;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run short, sharp bouncer earns huge applause from the crowds as Flintoff ducks away from it - just about. Lee likes it too, allowing himself a little grin. He and McGrath are enjoying themselves out there;
85.6;W;McGrath to PD Collingwood, OUT jaffer, unplayable. That bounces up and Collingwood's squared up, feathering that one through to Gilchrist for McGrath's third delivery. The way McGrath's been bowling this morning that wicket was pretty inevitable - and just reward for his endeavours;Paul Collingwood c ?Gilchrist b McGrath 27 (119m 73b 4x4 0x6) SR: 36.98;
85.5;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run defended into the covers;
85.4;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run straighter and that one crashes in at Flintoff, high;
85.3;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run again left, again easily;
85.2;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run left alone outside off;
85.1;3;McGrath to Flintoff, 3 runs opens his shoulders and cover-drives that powerfully but Symonds cuts it off. That's Flintoff's 24th Test this fifty, this one coming up from 89 balls;
84.6;2;Lee to PD Collingwood, 2 runs on leg and overpitched and worked behind square down to GD on the boundary who cannons it back in;
84.5;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run yorker, pitches on off and that's well dug out;
84.4;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run defended forward;
84.3;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run this one rises as it goes through straight and it's left alone;
84.2;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run more swing and another waft;
84.1;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood flashes at that one, aiming a cover drive, but misses and it swings away slightly;
83.6;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run defended to bring up another maiden;
83.5;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run ooh, well bowled - that one nips way back in at Flintoff off a good length and is right through him, past his inside edge and flies right over the stumps to Gilchrist. A pearler;
83.4;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run left alone again;
83.3;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run that one keeps low as it creeps away down the channel past Flintoff's bat;
83.2;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run nips in to Flintoff who defends it;
83.1;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run a hint of away swing, but Flintoff leaves that easily enough;
82.6;1lb;Lee to Flintoff, 1 leg bye pitches on leg, fullish, Flintoff works it to leg, off the leg;
82.5;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run up there and that's defended forward;
82.4;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run right on the money, Flintoff jams the bat down and Lee picks up the rebound and mock-shies at the stumps just to let Flintoff know he's alert;
82.3;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run left alone again;
82.2;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run;
82.1;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run ooh, a beauty - full and late movement, tempting Flintoff into the stroke. No foot movement and he just swishes at that. This is great bowling from the Australian pace pair first up;
81.6;1;McGrath to Flintoff, 1 run Flintoff squeezes that one out to the leg-side, well played;
81.5;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run left alone outside off;
81.4;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run Flintoff looking uncertain once again, this time to one which nips back and raps his pad;
81.3;4;McGrath to Flintoff, FOUR runs oh, an edge, and Langer's beaten again at third slip - but it wasn't a chance, as it bounced in front of him. Langer's more porous than a dodgy goalkeeper so far today. Flintoff beaten, though;
81.2;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run more leaving;
81.1;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run a good start too for McGrath, finding the button immediately but not detonating anything - Flintoff left it alone;
80.6;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run more swing and Collingwood veers away from it, letting it whistle past his nose;
80.5;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run speaking of oh - OH! - Collingwood should have gone there. For the second day running, Langer drops a catch at third slip. It's low and you don't need the replays to see if it carried - you can tell from his body language. Yesterday when he dropped Strauss he lay on his front looking at the turf ...for variety, today he stared at the heavens ... If Langer were a garden ornament, you could say he was in gnome-man's land;
80.4;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run in the corridor, and that one goes under Collingwood's elbow as he leaves it once more - a good area, acknowledged by a group 'Oh' from the slips;
80.3;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run straighter, short and Collingwood nudges that one into the leg-side with a loud cry of "No!";
80.2;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run more swing, more leaving;
80.1;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run swing there first up and that zings away from the right hander, who has room enough to leave it;
79.6;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run Flintoff prods and keeps the ball out;
79.5;1;Warne to PD Collingwood, 1 run flicked to the leg side for an ambled single;
79.4;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run big effort again, and a big grunt, and the effort is rewarded with a big legbreak past the bat;
79.3;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run good line, Collingwood reaches and just gets to it;
79.2;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run short again, and a grunt from Warne to go with it, Collingwood goes back and turns it to midwicket;
79.1;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run that one turned but too short to be a worry;
78.6;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run upright defensive prod into the off side;
78.5;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run Flintoff won't nibble at balls that wide at this stage of the day;

78.3;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run Flintoff square on, blocks;
78.2;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run Flintoff plays it into the covers;
78.1;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run wide, left alone;
77.6;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run Colllingwood shapes to sweep, misses, and the ball loops up off the bat with the ubiquitous shout of "catch it" ...Gilchrist scurries out but it drops safely, and in any case, it was not near the bat;
77.5;1;Warne to Flintoff, 1 run bobbled up to deep mid-on;
77.4;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run hammered into the covers ... or more accurately to the man in the covers;
77.3;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run googly, too short to cause any issues and Flintoff waits and blocks;
77.2;1;Warne to PD Collingwood, 1 run too full and clipped to deep midwicket;
77.1;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run thrusting padded defence;
76.6;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run outside off, left alone;
76.5;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run full, driven with little backlift but much power to mid-on;
76.4;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run driven slightly cross-battedly to short midwicket;
76.3;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run slightly slung, but it started wide and maintain its course;
76.2;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run Flintoff surprised a little as the ball nips away;
76.1;?;Symonds to Flintoff, no run it's seam, it's short and Flintoff pats it into the leg side;
75.6;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run short, that spun a bit and Collingwood goes back and drops it into the off side;
75.5;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run better line and length but little turn;
75.4;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run played with the respect the bowler deserves, if not the ball;
75.3;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run wide and no shot needed;
75.2;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run half volley, clipped into the leg side;
75.1;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run wide, spins even wider;
74.6;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run a very short one, more in anger than anything, and Flintoff ducks even though he needn't really have bothered;
74.5;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run Clark readjusts and it passes outside the off stump;
74.4;4;Clark to Flintoff, FOUR runs leg-side line, Flintoff just leans into it and the ball races through straight midwicket ... Clark was almost felled by the jogging Flintoff, whose eyes were on the ball, to add injury to insult;
74.3;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run Flintoff pushes forward, leaves it and waves the bat above his head with a little flourish more becoming of one of the Four Musketeers;
74.2;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run into line, patted away;
74.1;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run even Flintoff's defensive drives have enough power to fell a mortal;
73.6;1;Warne to Flintoff, 1 run driven to long-on;
73.5;1;Warne to PD Collingwood, 1 run short and that's more gifted runs from Warne;
73.4;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood forward to block;
73.3;1;Warne to Flintoff, 1 run driven to mid-off who remains deep enough for the single;
73.2;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run Flintoff thinks about the big heave and checks his desires;
73.1;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run big stride forward and lunging defensive stroke;
72.6;?;Clark to PD Collingwood, no run same line, and Collingwood simply not going to nibble;
72.5;?;Clark to PD Collingwood, no run Clark changes line from leg to outside off, but Collingwood not tempted;
72.4;?;Clark to PD Collingwood, no run once more plopped defensively into the leg side;
72.3;?;Clark to PD Collingwood, no run short, Collingwood forced back and drops it into the leg side;
72.2;2;Clark to PD Collingwood, 2 runs turned to long leg for an easy couple of runs;
72.1;1;Clark to Flintoff, 1 run driven to the left of mid-on and Brett Lee makes a leaping stop, good fielding as he ran ten yards before throwing himself full stretch to grab the ball;
71.6;?;Warne to PD Collingwood, no run finally Warne gets one on target and Collingwood goes back and blocks;
71.5;4;Warne to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs and again, even fuller, and the end result is the much the same;
71.4;4;Warne to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs another full toss, and he may be one of the greatest bowlers of all time but that was filthy, and Collingwood smacked that square on the leg side;
71.3;1;Warne to Flintoff, 1 run full toss worked to deep midwicket;
71.2;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run flighted, Flintoff stretches forward and is left groping at air as the ball fizzes past his outside edge;
71.1;?;Warne to Flintoff, no run a semi lunge and block;
70.6;?;Clark to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood gets everything behind that, a nothing-will-pass approach;
70.5;1;Clark to Flintoff, 1 run Flintoff stands tall and hits that into the covers to the man two-thirds back saving the two;
70.4;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run blocked, slightly hunched over the ball as he plays it;
70.3;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run again a slightly jerky prod, it's effective but you suspect that a little movement off the seam and he's in trouble;
70.2;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run Flintoff turned slightly square and defends;
70.1;4;Clark to Flintoff, FOUR runs uppish drive off the back foot, thick edge through fourth slip at catching height and four all the way;

68.3;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run came back off the seam but again the bounce carried it over the top;
68.2;?;Lee to PD Collingwood, no run more bounce and that's defended down forward off the back foot;
68.1;1;Lee to Flintoff, 1 run banged in short, that one rises sharply and Flintoff fends it down off the back foot - surprised by the bounce - and it flies low in front of the slips;

67.5;?;Clark to PD Collingwood, no run straight, and that's defended on the back foot;

65.6;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run shorter ball in response, but that's well left outside the off stick;
65.5;6;Clark to Flintoff, SIX runs hello! Top shot there from Flintoff, came from nowhere really; he just cracked that one from off over in front of midwicket;
65.4;?;Clark to Flintoff, no run even slower ball and Flintoff drives uppishly, but the ball stays low and pitches way before Symonds;

64.4;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run prods that one to gully;
64.3;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run good reply from Lee; on a day of cakes he supplies his own jaffer, which nearly licks Flintoff's outside edge;
64.2;4;Lee to Flintoff, FOUR runs too short and wide and Flintoff wastes no time swatting that disdainfully through cover with a back-foot punch;
64.1;?;Lee to Flintoff, no run defended forward;

60.2;?;McGrath to Flintoff, no run plenty of swing away from the batsman who leaves it alone first up;
60.1;W;McGrath to Bell, OUT great ball, McGrath straight through the defences and that's two wickets in five balls for him. McGrath's jaffer hit the top of off after nipping back in and taking the inside edge and England have two new batsmen at the crease;Ian Bell b McGrath 71 (194m 153b 8x4 0x6) SR: 46.4;

58.6;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run nips in off the seam and McGrath and the slips are up as one - but that's a good decision; it's outside the line and probably just going over;
58.5;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run more defence;
58.4;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run defends forward first up.;
58.3;W;McGrath to Pietersen, OUT gone this time - McGrath has his man, bounced out. Pietersen didn't control that hook and Hussey takes a good catch - running backwards - over his head at a slightly short midwicket. That's McGrath's first victim of the day, but his 900th international wicket;Kevin Pietersen c Hussey b McGrath 41 (162m 104b 1x4 0x6) SR: 39.42;
58.2;?;McGrath to Pietersen, no run defended this time;
58.1;2;McGrath to Pietersen, 2 runs ooh, aah, ooh, aah... safe. Pietersen charges McGrath, McGrath sees Pietersen's charge and bangs one in. Pietersen whips his wrists over it to flamingo-flick that one to midwicket, but he doesn't get over it and it flies high in the air, but lands in space;

57.5;?;Warne to Bell, no run quicker delivery and Bell can't get enough power on it as he tries to work it to leg;

56.5;?;McGrath to Bell, no run straighter and that's defended;
56.4;4;McGrath to Bell, FOUR runs short and, like Andrew troughing those cakes, it's put away quickly. Bell scorches that off the back foot through point and that brings up the 100 partnership - 101 from 227 deliveries to be presact;

51.2;?;Warne to Bell, no run driven past a sprawling short midwicket but mid-on has come up and in quickly;
51.1;1;Warne to Pietersen, 1 run driven to long-on. Ponting giving singles here;
50.6;1;Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run short, Pietersen onto it with real ease and controlled pull, wrists rolled, down to long leg;
50.5;1;Symonds to Bell, 1 run placed behind square on the leg;
50.4;1;Symonds to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen is a full two strides down the track and hits it to conventional mid-on and races through for the single ... hard to stop the run when the batsmen have almost crossed before the shot is played!;

49.4;?;Warne to Bell, no run Bell drives to the fielder on the leg;
49.3;1;Warne to Pietersen, 1 run rasping drive back at Warne, it smacks into the stumps as Aleem Dar takes undignified but utterly understandable evasive action. The ricochet goes into space on the off side;
49.2;?;Warne to Pietersen, no run flighted, Pietersen seemed ready to launch into it but thinks better of it and blocks;
49.1;3;Warne to Bell, 3 runs Bell back, waits and hammers it off the back foot past ... er ... McGrath at cover point. The chase is laboured and the batsmen see the chance and run three;

44.6;?;Symonds to Pietersen, no run Symonds spots Pietersen coming down the pitch and bangs one in, forcing him to jump and block;
44.5;2;Symonds to Pietersen, 2 runs some movement this time and so Pietersen gets an inside edge down to McGrath at long leg ... straight to the fielder but not at pace and Pietersen took on the arm and won quite easily;

 Innings Start
Lee from the Randwick End
2.30pm A team huddle for Australia, patting and bonding going on. Oh hey now, some handbags are being waved about out there - metaphorically, naturally - Strauss and Ponting are having a real ding-dong. No idea what that's about. Clark and Symonds, meanwhile, are really pumped out there in the covers - they're really fired up for this.
Innings break So Warne's entertaining innings finally comes to an end, removed by Panesar, to make that particular duel 1-1 for this match. Australia will be pleased with their efforts, a lead of 102. There will be ten minutes before Strauss and Cook head out.
Michael's on the money: "McGrath denied his maiden Test century by a selfishly extravagant Warne slog shot."
96.3;W;Panesar to Warne, OUT ah, the fairytale ends. Warne comes way out of his crease and the wristy Read does the rest, whipping off the bails with ease. That's six dismissals again for Read, as at Melbourne. The SCG rises as one for Warne who jogs off waving his bat. Relief is writ large in the form of a huge smile for McGrath, pleased in a small way that it wasn't him to fall at the last to leave Warne stranded;Shane Warne st ?Read b Panesar 71 (114m 65b 9x4 2x6) SR: 109.23;
96.2;?;Panesar to Warne, no run another miscue??? this one swept round behind square but didn't quite get hold of it;
96.1;?;Panesar to Warne, no run wide and Warne comes down the pitch and swings his bat, swiping that in front of midwicket;
95.6;?;Mahmood to McGrath, no run defended forward and more cheers;
95.5;?;Mahmood to McGrath, no run another leave;
95.4;?;Mahmood to McGrath, no run left alone and a big cheer goes up around the SCG as McGrath survives his first delivery;
95.3;W;Mahmood to Clark, OUT gone this time ??? Clark ballooning that one in the air, trying to hook, and Pietersen runs in for an easy catch, which he takes coolly. Clark goes for 35, his second-highest Test score.;Stuart Clark c Pietersen b Mahmood 35 (55m 41b 1x4 0x6) SR: 85.36;
95.2;1;Mahmood to Warne, 1 run nibbled to the covers again, the strike rotated one more;
95.1;1;Mahmood to Clark, 1 run driven into the covers, Pietersen's direct hit at the non-striker's end would have done for Clark, but he missed and Australia extend their lead to 101;
94.6;?;Panesar to Warne, no run another one in short outside off, Warne makes room outside the leg stump, slashes, but misses;
94.5;4;Panesar to Warne, FOUR runs too wide, Warne leans back and hammers that behind square and resumes his sledging of Collingwood before the ball has crossed the ropes!;
94.4;?;Panesar to Warne, no run well bowled, Warne cramped;
94.3;4;Panesar to Warne, FOUR runs a very good shot indeed, two steps to meet the ball and then he lofts it a straight as an arrow back over Panesar's head for a two-bounce four;
94.2;?;Panesar to Warne, no run wide, Warne square drives that to point;
94.1;1;Panesar to Clark, 1 run Clark waits and punches off the back foot to long-off;
93.6;3;Harmison to Clark, 3 runs driven through the off side and Panesar just catches it inside the rope;
93.5;?;Harmison to Clark, no run steepling bouncer, well aimed, and Clark does really well to get over it and keep it down;

93.3;1;Harmison to Warne, 1 run driven it to deep extra cover;
93.2;?;Harmison to Warne, no run slower ball, Warne realises too late that was one to cash in on, and he cries out in anguish as the ball trundles past him;
93.1;1;Harmison to Clark, 1 run Clark onto the back foot, right over it and dropped into the leg side to get Warne back on strike;
92.6;4;Mahmood to Warne, FOUR runs beautiful shot, guided through gully, all along the ground;
92.5;?;Mahmood to Warne, no run Warne gets himself in something of a muddle and the net result is he does well to keep the ball out;
92.4;1;Mahmood to Clark, 1 run booming off drive, uppish yet safe;
92.3;1lb;Mahmood to Warne, 1 leg bye thuds into Clarks pads and into the leg side;
92.2;1;Mahmood to Clark, 1 run Clark drives straight to mid-on and calls for a daft single, Harmison picks up well but from five yards his hurl at the bowler's-end stumps misses by some way with Clark floundering;

90.3;1;Anderson to Warne, 1 run another big drive, a thick edge and everyone looks to the heavens as the ball rises towards no-man's land at deep backward point;
90.2;4;Anderson to Warne, FOUR runs done it! Warne hammers the ball over extra cover, lofted, safe and it brings him his 12th Test fifty, his fourth against England. That four takes him to 53 runs from 47 balls, and the crowd stands to applaud. Now for the hundred?;
90.1;3;Anderson to Clark, 3 runs squirted through the slips, all along the ground, and the crowd cheer the third as it brings Warne back on strike;
89.6;?;Harmison to Warne, no run that was the ball to hit, but it stayed a tad low and Read took it on the second bounce at his feet;
89.5;?;Harmison to Warne, no run a fraction closer, he tries the same kind of shot but it's just too close to him and he misses once more;
89.4;?;Harmison to Warne, no run short and wide, Warne shapes to swish it over the slips but misses;
89.3;1lb;Harmison to Clark, 1 leg bye fired in at Clark's legs, it thuds into his pads and rolls into the leg side;
89.2;1;Harmison to Warne, 1 run steered into the covers for a strolled single ... Warne's favourite way to run between the wickets. He's on 49 ...;
89.1;3;Harmison to Clark, 3 runs wide and absolutely smashes over extra cover off the back foot, a splendid shot which deserved the four, but Warne happier with the three as he gets the strike;
88.6;2;Anderson to Warne, 2 runs Warne aims a lofted drive over mid-off, but it ends up whizzing out in the straight midwicket direction. Ungainly but effective ...;

88.3;2;Anderson to Clark, 2 runs punched off the back foot past cover, good running gets them back for the second with plenty to spare;
88.2;1;Anderson to Warne, 1 run good length outside the off stump, Warne reaches for it and drives it to the sweeper;
88.1;2;Anderson to Warne, 2 runs head up and thwacked over the covers, Pietersen fields in the deep and his throw is so wayward it really didn't appear to be aimed at either end;
87.6;1;Flintoff to Warne, 1 run Warne back and angled into the gully, and he was off before it was halfway there ... he was going to get the strike regardless. Geoff Boycott would be proud ...;
87.5;?;Flintoff to Warne, no run missed on the walk, he gave a half-prod and it was through him by the time he did so;
87.4;1;Flintoff to Clark, 1 run pitched up, flicked into the leg side;

86.1;?;Anderson to Clark, no run More oohs and aahs from the crowd ... Clark misjudges the ball and pokes it back in the air, but it loops between bowler and the incoming mid-on;
85.6;?;Flintoff to Warne, no run angled into Warne's body, he steps back to try to give himself room but the ball follows him and he can only push it into the covers and scowl. Clark has the strike again;
85.5;1;Flintoff to Clark, 1 run and Clark hits that on the half volley through midwicket to the man on the rope;
85.4;?;Flintoff to Clark, no run left alone, and Warne looking impatient at the non-striker's end ... he wants to get on with it but he can't get the strike;

84.6;1;Anderson to Clark, 1 run Anderson drifts to leg and Clark turns the ball behind square;
84.5;?;Anderson to Clark, no run Clark beaten again with another peach and Read gives a wry grin;
84.4;?;Anderson to Clark, no run short of a length and it zips through Clark - zero foot movement - and Read takes it on the rise above his head;
84.3;1;Anderson to Warne, 1 run too much width once more, and Warne smashes that with a crisp crack to the sweeper on the cover boundary;
84.2;?;Anderson to Warne, no run Warne shuffles into line and plays it up to mid-on with a loud "no";
84.1;?;Anderson to Warne, no run short, wide, Warne leans back and aims a massive swipe and misses ... it could have gone anywhere had he connected;
83.6;1;Flintoff to Warne, 1 run Warne shimmies to off and flicks the ball to square leg;
83.5;1;Flintoff to Clark, 1 run good length, Clark shuffles across and turns it to shortish midwicket;
83.4;2;Flintoff to Clark, 2 runs flicked to backward square leg, Clark called for the second and Anderson's throw was within an inch of being a direct hit and if it had been, Clark would have been a yard out;
83.3;W;Flintoff to Lee, OUT same line as the previous delivery, just short of a length and Brett Lee fends at the ball and nicks it. A routine catch for Chris Read, his fifth of the innings;Brett Lee c ?Read b Flintoff 5 (14m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50;
83.2;?;Flintoff to Lee, no run good line, a fraction outside off, and Lee jabs at it from where he was standing and misses;
83.1;?;Flintoff to Lee, no run Lee back, jumpily, and prods the ball rather suspiciously into the off side;
82.6;?;Anderson to Warne, no run left alone and that's lunch in what's been an entertaining session;
82.5;?;Anderson to Warne, no run short and there's some swing - and that one moves off the seam as well, Warne's feet not really moving to that and he has a small fish, a fishette if you like;
82.4;1;Anderson to Lee, 1 run tucked off the back foot to square and Warne's only interested in the single - happy to stay on strike;
82.3;?;Anderson to Lee, no run left alone;
82.2;4;Anderson to Lee, FOUR runs width this time and Lee takes his cue from Warne, with an attacking larrup off the back foot which races behind point;
82.1;?;Anderson to Lee, no run a hint of swing in the air and Lee fails to drive that properly;
81.6;?;Flintoff to Warne, no run more good fielding, this time in the covers - Collingwood with a huge sprawling one-handed dive to his right;
81.5;2;Flintoff to Warne, 2 runs clipped very finely off his legs but Mahmood does well on the boundary, with a diving one-handed lunge;
81.4;?;Flintoff to Warne, no run down the leg again, on the rise, and Warne has a swish, misses;
81.3;?;Flintoff to Warne, no run good line and length from Flintoff asking Warne to have a dart at it. He does, prodding at it on the back foot but fails to edge it;
81.2;?;Flintoff to Warne, no run ooh dear, wonky radar there and Warne goes chasing one which flirts down leg;
81.1;?;Flintoff to Warne, no run innocuous loosener, left alone;
80.6;?;Anderson to Lee, no run left alone;
80.5;?;Anderson to Lee, no run probing, probing and nearly extracts... Deviation off the seam, a hint of swing and he goes swishing off the back foot;
80.4;?;Anderson to Lee, no run short and on him and that's fended to gully;
80.3;W;Anderson to Gilchrist, OUT gone! Fishing at a very wide one and it appears an edge flies up to Read - or was the noise bat into the ground? There's a long time for the crooked finger to spell doom. Gilchrist can't believe it and the crowd can't either - the boos ring out as the dismissal is replayed on the giant screens around the SCG and Gilchrist walks off keeping his emotions to himself;Adam Gilchrist c ?Read b Anderson 62 (118m 72b 8x4 0x6) SR: 86.11;
80.2;?;Anderson to Gilchrist, no run pushed up there, across the lefthander from over the wicket, and they decide to "Wait, wait, wait." That'll be a no, then;
80.1;1;Anderson to Warne, 1 run nudged into the gap through cover;
79.6;?;Panesar to Gilchrist, no run pushed right up there and Gilchrist can only defend;
79.5;?;Panesar to Gilchrist, no run strides forward but defends that on the front foot;
79.4;1;Panesar to Warne, 1 run bounces up at him, surprises him, but he still makes time to play that one off the back foot to cover;
79.3;4;Panesar to Warne, FOUR runs width, poor, and Warne makes no mistake in cutting that off the back foot. Nice, Shane;
79.2;?;Panesar to Warne, no run quiet defence this time;
79.1;6;Panesar to Warne, SIX runs six from the moment it left the bat - Warne whips that one in front of midwicket, clearing the man in the deep. The fifty partnership, in just 37 balls, comes up in style;
78.6;2;Harmison to Gilchrist, 2 runs short from Mahmood and Gilchrist's eyes light up and his arms launch out to sail that one up and over point;
78.5;?;Harmison to Gilchrist, no run creeps down the track, drives to mid-off and will they run? "Nooo!";
78.4;1;Harmison to Warne, 1 run worked into midwicket;
78.3;1;Harmison to Gilchrist, 1 run round the wicket again, that's wide and Gilchrist mishooks that in front of square and it's in the air for a long time but even Panesar's gazelle legs won't carry him there fast enough. That's now 10000 first-class runs for Gilchrist, but those won't be memorable ones for him. And at 44.84, too - top stuff;
78.2;?;Harmison to Gilchrist, no run helped out to point;
78.1;?;Harmison to Gilchrist, no run driven out to mid-off but they decide to "Waaait!";
77.6;2;Panesar to Warne, 2 runs Warne waits and dinks that off the back foot with limited foot movement over through midwicket - they're looking for two there, and they'll have to hurry, but in safely in the end;
77.5;?;Panesar to Warne, no run more turn, but wider and Warne leaves it easily;
77.4;?;Panesar to Warne, no run turn and bounce in front of off peg and Warne can only watch it go past;
77.3;?;Panesar to Warne, no run Warne looking for the slog sweep over midwicket and Panesar tossed that wider, fizzing away from Warne - good bowling;
77.2;?;Panesar to Warne, no run waits and works that well off the back foot to point;
77.1;4;Panesar to Warne, FOUR runs splendid aerial drive, Warne dancing down and smashing that back over Panesar's head, watching it all the way;
76.6;4;Harmison to Gilchrist, FOUR runs great, just great - Gilchrist late cuts that one ever so gently, just a fine caress, and with sheer timing that ball shoots away;
76.5;4;Harmison to Gilchrist, FOUR runs brilliant shot, created room for himself for one that wasn't that wide and that's zapped to the boundary. Big cheers as Australia take the lead;
76.4;?;Harmison to Gilchrist, no run "Aw wait," is the call and that's driven out to mid-off;
76.3;1;Harmison to Warne, 1 run a quick single and "Have to hurry, Shane!" calls Michael Atherton, chivvying him along - a direct hit from Flintoff and he would have been gone;
76.2;4;Harmison to Warne, FOUR runs width there on the off side, Warne licks his lips and that's cream-bunned off the back foot in front of point, sweet shot and Bell just can't;
76.1;1;Harmison to Gilchrist, 1 run good length delivery angling in and that's driven to long on;
75.6;?;Panesar to Warne, no run well bowled by Panesar to end the over, right up there and Warne's forced to jam his bat down at the last micro-second;
75.5;?;Panesar to Warne, no run well bowled, saw the man coming, and flighted it up;
75.4;?;Panesar to Warne, no run comes out to meet that one, but defends;
75.3;1;Panesar to Gilchrist, 1 run turns very sharply in at Gilchrist who does well to wait and somehow make room to drive that softly into the covers to bring up a cracking half-century. Well batted;
75.2;?;Panesar to Gilchrist, no run flight again, straighter and that pops up softly on the leg-side... but lands in space;
75.1;?;Panesar to Gilchrist, no run a touch wide, but on a good length and that's defended;
74.6;4;Mahmood to Warne, FOUR runs great shot from Warne, making that into a half-volley, getting into a good position, waiting, and driving it straight as you like... and we do like;
74.5;1;Mahmood to Gilchrist, 1 run short and that's hooked just short of Pietersen at deep square leg. Good attempt from KP, there;
74.4;?;Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run defended this time and we all catch our breath;
74.3;4;Mahmood to Gilchrist, FOUR runs low full bunger, and they're not easy to deal with, but Gilchrist did very well to wait for that one and pump it straight down the ground with good timing;
74.2;?;Mahmood to Gilchrist, no run defended this time - no dramas;
74.1;2;Mahmood to Gilchrist, 2 runs ooh, more excitement - Warne just making his ground for the two as it's winged out in front of point. Mahmood was standing by the side of the stumps, instead of behind them, and could have had him way out there. Warne riding his luck, here;
73.6;?;Panesar to Warne, no run it's all drama here! This time sharp turn and bounce and I can hardly type fast enough - big deflection off the glove and Read's up to celebrate. Panesar runs forward with a big, smily appeal - Warne looks around, too - but Dar says 'No' and Warne gets a stay of execution;
73.5;?;Panesar to Warne, no run a ha, clever from Panesar, just defeating the outside edge as Warne attempts a swish;
73.4;?;Panesar to Warne, no run a disappointing dot... Warne comes forward and pushes that one into the point region;
73.3;6;Panesar to Warne, SIX runs brilliant! What an eye from Warne who strides forward and with a pre-meditated aerial drive over mid-wicket just lifts the ball all the way. Strike-rate 500...;
73.2;4;Panesar to Warne, FOUR runs Warne gets down on one knee and proposes to sweep that round fine, and in fact the ball does get engaged, with a bottom edge. Off the mark first ball, with a four;
73.1;W;Panesar to Symonds, OUT done him! Terrible shot from Symonds, looking to swing away on the on-side but plays all round it and he's cleaned up just short of what would have been a well-deserved half-century. He was playing so well, working the singles around, but a head rush, a swoosh, and he's gone;Andrew Symonds b Panesar 48 (138m 95b 6x4 0x6) SR: 50.52;

72.3;1;Mahmood to Symonds, 1 run pitches on off, up there, and that's dabbed down to point off the back foot and there's a quick, well-taken run;
72.2;?;Mahmood to Symonds, no run helped out to point, following up with a loud cry of "No!";
72.1;?;Mahmood to Symonds, no run Symonds comes forward and nearly yorks himself, but defends stoutly instead at the last minute, jamming his bat down;

71.5;?;Panesar to Gilchrist, no run defended this time;
71.4;1;Panesar to Symonds, 1 run driven slowly to mid-on;
71.3;1;Panesar to Gilchrist, 1 run Gilchrist after Panesar as he was at Perth but that's miscued out to point - an attempted lofted off-drive;
71.2;2;Panesar to Gilchrist, 2 runs lofted drive, straight down the ground, but doesn't quite get hold of it and James Anderson races round from a wide long-on to get that;
71.1;?;Panesar to Gilchrist, no run driven slowly to cover;
70.6;?;Mahmood to Symonds, no run Symonds edges forward to meet that one but realises the length is bang on and defends that one into the midwicket region with a big call of "No!";
70.5;4;Mahmood to Symonds, 4 runs on-drive worked classily wide of mid-on and the runs are flowing here for Australia;
70.4;?;Mahmood to Symonds, no run attempted bouncer, strays leggily (as it were, you know what I mean) and that's easily swayed away from;

70.2;1;Mahmood to Symonds, 1 run a touch of width and you can't bowl there to him, Symonds just laces that off the back foot just in front of point;
70.1;?;Mahmood to Symonds, no run left alone, big arms shouldered hugely;
69.7;1;Panesar to Symonds, 1 run Symonds brings his shoulders over that one to drive it to midwicket and that's a seven-ball over, oops...;
69.6;1;Panesar to Gilchrist, 1 run driven to long-off and the strike's rotated once more;
69.5;1;Panesar to Symonds, 1 run driven easily out to mid-on where it's lazily thrown back to the bowler;
69.4;1;Panesar to Gilchrist, 1 run driven out to mid-off;
69.3;?;Panesar to Gilchrist, no run more defence;
69.2;?;Panesar to Gilchrist, no run like a good lawyer when you need one, that's defended tightly;

68.1;1;Mahmood to Symonds, 1 run fullish delivery outside off, Symonds gets forward and pushes it to mid-off;
67.6;4;Harmison to Gilchrist, 4 runs banged in, Gilchrist rocks back and launches it high over midwicket ... but like a Tiger Woods chip onto the green, it rolls within inches of the rope and stops. Panesar has to chug all the way out to the rope to field and a puffed Gilchrist runs four;
67.5;1;Harmison to Symonds, 1 run shortish and yet again too leg-side, flicked round the corner;
67.4;1;Harmison to Gilchrist, 1 run played with an angled bat to the man on the boundary just behind square on the off;
67.4;1nb;Harmison to Gilchrist, (no ball) better line but a no-ball;
67.3;2;Harmison to Gilchrist, 2 runs dropped but a bit harsh to blame Anderson ... the ball was driven to his right at short extra cover, he dived full length and he got fingertips to it an inch above the ground;
67.2;1;Harmison to Symonds, 1 run into the body of Symonds who turns it towards midwicket who is too deep to save the single;
67.1;1;Harmison to Gilchrist, 1 run Harmison again drifts to leg, turned round the corner, all a bit limp;
66.6;4;Mahmood to Symonds, FOUR runs much better shot, full and driven all along the ground through extra cover, giving the chasing fielder not a hope of getting near it;
66.5;?;Mahmood to Symonds, no run no shot and through to Read;
66.4;4;Mahmood to Symonds, FOUR runs wide and short, slashed only inches over Anderson at backward point, but it would have taken his fingers off had he got them to it;
66.3;?;Mahmood to Symonds, no run wider, and Symonds managed to move his feet much more in leaving the ball than he did when playing it;
66.2;?;Mahmood to Symonds, no run lovely ball, full, Symonds looks to drive and it beats the outside edge. Not much foot movement there ...;

65.4;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run not as much width, but still wide enough for him to leave alone;
65.3;4;Flintoff to Gilchrist, FOUR runs classic Gilchrist. Short and wide, cut with real oomph through gully and it races to the rope;

64.2;1;Harmison to Gilchrist, 1 run pushed through the gap in the covers, fielded by the sweeper;
64.1;?;Harmison to Gilchrist, no run checked drive, stopped by a tumbling short extra cover ...not needed as mid-off was waiting behind him, but it looked good and got some applause;
63.6;?;Flintoff to Symonds, no run fuller but Symonds ready for the surprise one pitched in his half;
63.5;?;Flintoff to Symonds, no run and more of the same. Not sure what this tactic is, as the balls are far too short for the batsman to try to play;
63.4;?;Flintoff to Symonds, no run banged in, Symonds ducks again;
63.3;?;Flintoff to Symonds, no run short, Symonds ducks;
63.2;1;Flintoff to Gilchrist, 1 run Glichrist does little more than pushes the ball into the covers, it trundles all the way out to the rope where the sweeper fields;

62.3;?;Harmison to Symonds, no run a touch straighter and Symonds blocks;
62.2;?;Harmison to Symonds, no run that barely carried through to Read, and at 79mph (127kph) it's hardly surprising;

61.3;?;Flintoff to Symonds, no run Symonds into line , not a sniff of his last-over blitzkrieg last night;
61.2;?;Flintoff to Symonds, no run Symonds turns square as he blocks and the ball scoots to gully;
61.1;?;Flintoff to Symonds, no run too wide ...Flintoff needs to rediscover the zip of his first over;
60.6;?;Anderson to Gilchrist, no run Gilchrist half forward to defend, loud shout of "no" as he hits it;
60.5;2;Anderson to Gilchrist, 2 runs crack! A bit too wide and another crashing drive through extra cover, but now England have a man in the deep to give Anderson some protection;

59.1;?;Flintoff to Symonds, no run whipped to Panesar at midwicket;
58.6;?;Anderson to Gilchrist, no run too full, driven with a real crack right at mid-off .... no runs but that will have warmed the fielder's hands up;

32.3;W;Panesar to Ponting, OUT now that's a big shout and Panesar thinks the man is gone after Anderson's direct hit from mid-on, ten yards away. A silly single to risk and Bowden nodded immediately there, with replays confirming that Ponting's about a foot short. Huge roars from the crowd as the verdict flashes on the screen.

25.4;?;Harmison to Hussey, no run;
25.3;W;Harmison to Hayden, OUT short and wide, inexplicably Hayden slashes at it and the ball flies off the top edge straight to Collingwood at second slip.

 Innings Start
11.30pm A crowd of about 40,000, by the way, and there are 11 English men on the pitch in a huddle.
Rousing reception now as Langer walks out for the last time, and he's joined of course by Hayden, with whom he's formed such a strong opening partnership. Nice touch from England, the players forming a corridor for him to walk through and he shakes hands with Flintoff. Hayden now pats him on the ribs, with a "Well done, mate" gesture.
Langer now asks for the sight screen to be adjusted slightly, and then walks down the middle of the pitch, in typical style, before taking his guard ready to face Anderson, who is opening from the Randwick End.
The two opening batsmen dash off the field to get ready - and, sorry, but the thousands of readers haven't got their wish; it's Langer and Hayden. Meanwhile, back on the pitch, the Australians all hug each other, as do the players' wives, although they stop short of ruffling each other's hair.
There's applause all round the SCG for Warne and McGrath and they receive a well-deserved standing ovation. Warne takes off his white sunhat and waves it around and he and McGrath lead the rest of the team off the field.
57.6;W;McGrath to Anderson, OUT gone this time and McGrath takes the final wicket at his home ground, the SCG. Anderson aimed the easiest of catches up into the midwicket region to bring the innings to an end and leave Australia needing a mere 47 for a deserved 5-0 whitewash;James Anderson c Hussey b McGrath 5 (37m 22b 1x4 0x6) SR: 22.72;

55.5;?;McGrath to Anderson, no run Anderson blocks;
55.4;4;McGrath to Anderson, FOUR runs Anderson spars at the ball, it drops a foot short of Warne at first slip and goes straight through his leg. Warne looks bemused, McGrath looks a little unimpressed;

54.1;?;Warne to Harmison, no run Harmison takes a big stride, sweeps, misses and Gilchrist takes the ball well down the leg side and whips off the bails ... the third umpire has several looks before deciding that it's not out.

51.3;3;McGrath to Harmison, 3 runs full toss outside off, cracked to Symonds at mid-off who makes a complete sow's ear of a bobbling ball and allows two extra runs. McGrath might be on the verge of bowing out but he can still scowl and make clear his displeasure;
51.2;4;McGrath to Harmison, FOUR runs now, that's a bit disrespectful. Harmison clubs the ball from outside off stump over mid-off. McGrath scowls;

49.6;W;McGrath to Mahmood, OUT McGrath nips one back, it keeps a little low but that makes not a scrap of difference as Mahmood was back in his crease and airborne as well, and his off stump is pegged back via a thin edge.;Sajid Mahmood b McGrath 4 (13m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 36.36;

41.3;W;Warne to Flintoff, OUT done him this time - Flintoff drags himself down the pitch, leaning out to defend, and his foot is out of the crease as Warne spins that one from leg to past his off stump. He tries to get his foot back, in vain, and it's on the line. Gilchrist knows it's out - he took the bails off and set off sprinting.

29.2;?;Symonds to Pietersen, no run Pietersen being Pietersen - he comes down the pitch and tries to work that from off to leg, misses it completely and it cannons into his leg and there is a big appeal. But that one was going over the top and he was far down the pitch;

23.4;?;McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run left outside the off stump. It's a battle of wills. Bell failed the test ...;

21.3;?;McGrath to Pietersen, no run and once more left. Ponting said that the secret is to keep Pietersen on the back foot, and it's working;
21.2;?;McGrath to Pietersen, no run left again. McGrath is the expert at probing relentlessly, and even if KP doesn't drive, the runs have dried up;

20.5;W;Lee to Bell, OUT back to the wide line but this time Bell throws the kitchen sink at it and the snick can be heard even with the Barmies in full flow.

Warne yawns ... he's had a tough day
 Innings Start
Langer shakes hands with everyone, Strauss patting him on the back a few times, and the Australian team run onto the pitch to soak up the party atmosphere and get the celebrations starting after a crushing, emphatic victory. A swarm of photographers crowd round a teary Langer and he smiles, now Gilchrist hugs him, now Lee. Lots of emotions out there, now it's Symonds giving him a hug. McGrath's turn, the two retirees share an embrace. Hussey this time. Warne and Langer now. Well done everyone.
A stony-faced Flintoff (well, stony by his standards) takes his players off the pitch. Australia of course stay on - this is their moment.
Langer now takes his bat and raises it to the jubilant crowd, while Hayden puts an arm round his shoulders. McGrath claps his hands above his head to acknowledge the crowd. Warne doffs his cap and waves a stump around. Ponting now takes his turn to tousle Langer's hair.
"No dry eye in the house," says Lee as McGrath steals the limelight behind him, raising his two children, James and Holly, aloft. "It's been an amazing series," says McGrath. "I don't think we've ever played as well team-wise." Warne's three children are now on the pitch, as well. The Warnes and the McGraths gather now for a family shot.
Open tears now for a red-eyed Langer, who's taking a moment to reflect on a great Test career.
Ian Healy collars Warne now. "Pretty excited, actually!" chirps Warne as if he's somehow surprised. "Aw, look, it's been fantastic. To finish off 5-0, sensational."
And on McGrath's 5-0 prediction, he says: "If he keeps saying it, he's got to get it right once, I suppose." Big reception for him now from all the crowd.
Langer tells Mark Taylor: "To win 5-0 it cannot get any better than that." And he has this message for everyone: "It's been a privilege."
Stuart Clark wins the Man of the Match and he's "enjoyed every minute of it." Ricky Ponting is the Man of the Series. He wins a crystal trophy and the Compton-Miller medal. "It's a great honour. It's been pretty emotional."
Andrew Flintoff called to the podium. He looks embarrassed. "I'd like to congratulate Ricky Ponting and his team," he says, monotone, but then picks up the tone a bit when congratulating Warne, Langer and McGrath and gives his heartfelt thanks. "They've never given up," he says of the England team and they clap weakly. He then thanks "the Barmy Army and every English fan out here."
Ponting's body language an understandable contrast and he jogs back and positively leaps up to the podium to collect the Ashes. He congratulates everyone, including the coach John Buchanan, who raises his hat.
Well, as Australia's celebrations begin, it's time to say goodbye from us. That's it from me (Jenny) and Martin Williamson - and an honorary mention for our fellow commentator Will Luke. Thanks very much for joining us and for all of your emails; hope you've enjoyed it.
