Data
"I reckon we've done a bit better than average, you know?" is Symonds's verdict as he leaves the pitch.
Vettori's pretty content, with the exception of Symonds' mighty destruction. "Apart from him, I think it's a pretty good effort. They're a little bit more than we would have liked, but it's a good wicket so hopefully we can chase it down."
Well, that was predictably frenetic. Pomersbach's unexpected debut was an impressive one but Symonds has stolen the show. In the switch-over calm you may like to read Peter English's appraisal of Ashley Noffke who will soon have the chance to impress the ball, having missed out with the bat.
Replays, by the way, suggest Taylor didn't actually have full control of the Symonds would-be catch. All's history now as we gear up for New Zealand's innings as they aim to chase down 187.

12.3;1;Oram to Symonds, 1 run worked out to long-on this time;
12.2;4;Oram to Symonds, FOUR runs much less convincing, but nevertheless a four, a Chinese cut, Symonds looking to drive to cover instead gets the inside edge through fine leg;

6.00pm Australia playing with their nicknames on their back. So it's Churchie to face the first ball - Adam Gilchrist, to the uninitiated, who picked up his nickname I believe when a young fan thought he was called "Eric Gilchurch"... oh, years ago now.
5.45pm Here are the teams: New Zealand 1 Brendon McCullum (wk), 2 Lou Vincent, 3 Ross Taylor, 4 Scott Styris, 5 Jamie How, 6 Mathew Sinclair, 7 Jacob Oram, 8 Daniel Vettori (capt), 9 Kyle Mills, 10 Mark Gillespie, 11 Jeetan Patel.
Australia 1 Adam Gilchrist (wk), 2 Adam Voges, 3 Michael Clarke (capt), 4 Michael Hussey, 5 Andrew Symonds, 6 Luke Pomersbach, 7 Brett Lee, 8 Ashley Noffke, 9 Nathan Bracken, 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Shaun Tait.
Luke Pomersbach has had a late call-up, as Brad Hodge has injured his back, I'm informed by two colleagues simultaneously, Toby Clayton and Peter English, who will be crafting the bulletin for us.
Further news filtering in, this from Cricket Australia, that Hodge injured in his back in the dressing room. We will give you more details if and when we get them.
He's certainly an exciting prospect, Pomersbach, and heads into the side on the back of a match-winning 88 for the Chairman's XI against the New Zealanders at Lilac Hill on Friday, and it's great for him to be making his international debut in front of his home crowd, who are sure to give him a rousing reception. An awesome, hard-hitting talent and when he comes off he's great to watch.
It's been a few interesting weeks for him, as well. He was recently banned from state competition for Western Australia along with team-mate Shaun Marsh, for breaking a team curfew, although he did play for their second team... His state said at the time: "Pomersbach will not be considered for selection until the Pura Cup game against South Australia starting on December 14". But he will, apparently, be considered by his country - and more...
Pomersbach was in the car park of the ground, having turned up to watch with his girlfriend, when he learned he was included. Unbelievable! Vaguely reminds me of when England's Holly Colvin turned up for nets on the eve of the women's Ashes, aged 15, and found herself on a hat-trick the next day. Only she wasn't playing in front of quite so many...
5.30pm Toss news just in - Michael Clarke has won and chosen to bat first, possibly with a nod to the showers that are forecast.
5.10pm "Everyone, including the players, are very excited about what lies ahead," says Adam Gilchrist and he's not wrong. "This time last year I was a bit of a sceptic, but having been to a world championship and seen the popularity, I think this, in combination with fifty-over cricket is going to be a very important combination." He also let slip that Clarke is "very very nervous about it [captaining], but I think we have got a skipper in the making." Under an hour to go now till kick-off.
5pm AWDT Greetings everyone and welcome along to Cricinfo's coverage of the one-off Twenty20 between Australia and New Zealand. Don't know about you but it seems ages since there's been a Twenty20, even though Australia only played six weeks ago and were beaten by India, the world champions if you can cast your minds even further back to September. Don't strain too much, though, because Twenty20 is about entertainment as much as anything, although the teams will be taking the match quite seriously.
New Zealand have much to prove after coming off a losing tour of South Africa, although they did have a chance to take the one-day series and were looking pretty good from what I saw on TV. They're down the injured Shane Bond and James Franklin, but nevertheless have a pretty sturdy line-up and will be led as ever by Daniel Vettori, for whom Brendon McCullum deputised well at Lilac Hill last Friday, with a ton in a losing game.
Australia's captain Michael Clarke will be aiming to give it his best in his first match in charge. What a transformation for a player who was still fighting for his place up until last year's Ashes - and he was still nervous when he took a call from Andrew Hilditch, the chairman of selectors, recently. But it was nothing but good news.
The side are taking this format much more seriously since losing to Zimbabwe in the World tournament in South Africa, although it's hard to take their uniforms so seriously, they retain their Bob the Builder outfits of yellow vest with grey undershirt. Don't all rush out to the shops at once.
I'm Jenny Thompson, by the way, and it's a great pleasure to be relaying my first commentary of an Australia match since moving here recently. Loving the country, as does my fellow Pom and old uni housemate Dickie Thould, whose apartment overlooks the game which is in Perth tonight - he is balcony-bound, alas, after being too late for tickets; this game is a sell-out.
He tells me that his flat was shaken by thunder and lightning not a few hours ago, as conditions have been so humid at the WACA, but despite some showers play shouldn't be held up and we're now waiting for the toss which is still a little way off.
So while we are, some stats about both teams' remarkably similar Twenty20 record, shamelessly lifted from one of our previews:
They contested the first international in 2004-05; they have each played 12 games, Australia have six wins and New Zealand have five; they were both knocked out in the semi-finals at the World Twenty20; and they were each defeated in their only match since then.
So, everything very much to play for - not least some momentum ahead of the Chappell-Hadlee Series which kicks off in Adelaide this Friday.
 Innings Start
Well, that's a comprehensive victory for Australia featuring several debutants and under Michael Clarke's captaincy for the first time. A good Twenty20 game on a pacy WACA pitch which had everything in all three departments. Fireworks erupt in celebration of an excellent spectacle, with Oram at least fighting back at the end to reward a packed house. New Zealand, then, have been given something to think about ahead of the Chappell-Hadlee Series of three one-dayers which kicks off on Friday in Adelaide. But Australia have a worry with Symonds' injury, he hurt his ankle fielding. Thanks for joining me today and do come back for some more action at the end of the week.
