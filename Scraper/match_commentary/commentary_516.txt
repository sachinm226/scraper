Data
So, Australia have finished with 133, which is below par on what should be a good batting pitch. Sri Lanka bowled and fielded really well, Randiv and Perera were the standouts. Haddin and Smith got Australia back in the contest, but they'll need a super bowling effort to defend this total. Join us in a few minutes for the chase.
19.6;W;Fernando to Hastings, 1 run, OUT crunched through cover and the batsmen come back for an ambitious two, the throw finds Hastings short diving back into his ground, he's unselfishly run out trying for that final run;John Hastings run out (Randiv/?Sangakkara) 15 (8b 2x4 0x6) SR: 187.5;
19.5;4;Fernando to Hastings, FOUR runs oh, good batting from Hastings, again he's backed away and this time Fernando follows the batsman, but fine leg is up and Hastings flicked that one through the gap and safely away to the boundary;
19.4;4;Fernando to Hastings, FOUR runs very useful runs! Hastings backs away and slashes hard, a thick outside edge flies away to third man for a boundary;
19.3;1;Fernando to McKay, 1 run McKay backs off and drives hard down the ground, but long off cuts it off easily;
19.2;1;Fernando to Hastings, 1 run shorter and at the body, Hastings guides it off the face of the bat to third man;
19.1;2;Fernando to Hastings, 2 runs Hastings backs away and gets that one off the toe of the bat over point, picks up a couple of handy runs;
18.6;4;Malinga to McKay, FOUR runs pretty well played there by McKay, he's manufactured a boundary by walking across his stumps and lifting a half-volley off middle over midwicket;
18.6;1w;Malinga to McKay, 1 wide down leg side again, even further this time and that's the third wide of the over;
18.5;?;Malinga to McKay, no run slower ball, and it's a swing and a miss as McKay tries to slam it back over the bowler's head;
18.4;1;Malinga to Hastings, 1 run slower ball, Hastings picks it and pushes a single to cover, Kapugedera shies at the bowler's end and misses, that would have been a run out;
18.3;1;Malinga to McKay, 1 run shortish and at the body, McKay tries to pull and it's much quicker onto him than he expected, does get bat on ball though and lobs a single to square leg;
18.3;1w;Malinga to McKay, 1 wide oops, down leg side and that's justifiably called a wide;
18.2;?;Malinga to McKay, no run punched to mid off, McKay can't beat the field, good full bowling from Malinga;
18.1;1;Malinga to Hastings, 1 run good yorker, Hastings keeps it out and jabs a single to mid on;
18.1;1w;Malinga to Hastings, 1 wide short and fast, Hastings hasn't much idea about that and lets it go through to Sangakkara. Oh, that's been called a wide, that's simply not the right decision, it was only head height;
13.6;?;Murali to Haddin, no run defended away safely;

13.4;?;Murali to Haddin, no run Haddin goes back into his crease and clips to midwicket;
13.3;?;Murali to Haddin, no run run-out chance goes begging - Haddin cuts late and is turned back going for the quick single, the under-arm throw to Sangakkara is too wide and a diving Haddin makes his ground;
13.2;4;Murali to Haddin, FOUR runs ah, a bit of good fortune for Haddin, who looks to sweep through square leg and just gets a little under-edge that races away to fine leg;

13.1;1;Murali to Smith, 1 run clipped off the pads behind square leg;

12.5;1;Perera to Smith, 1 run driven down the ground this time;
12.4;6;Perera to Smith, SIX runs finally, a six! Smith opens up his stance and muscles the ball over midwicket, for a minute it looked like Randiv in the deep might have a chance but it's lobbed just over the boundary;

16.5;1;Malinga to Haddin, 1 run slower delivery this time, Haddin guides a single behind point;

16.1;2;Malinga to Haddin, 2 runs tries for the yorker and it turns into a low full toss on the pads, Haddin glances it away and Fernando at short fine leg knocks it down without stopping it properly;
11.6;2;Randiv to Haddin, 2 runs late cut this time, well played Haddin, but Australia need a lot more from him to turn this into a competitive total;
11.5;4;Randiv to Haddin, FOUR runs great shot! Haddin has struck what is, incredibly, the third boundary of the innings, a proper straight drive that comes off the middle of the bat and beats long on and long off, who converge in their attempts to cut it off;

10.3;?;Malinga to Smith, no run good yorker, swinging it back in a touch, and Malinga wants an lbw but that was sliding down leg;
10.2;?;Malinga to Smith, no run edged and just short of slip, who has come in for the new batsman. Gosh, that could so easily have gone to hand!;
10.1;W;Malinga to White, OUT Malinga strikes first ball! Short and wide, White's eyes light up but the extra bounce surprises him, his cut turns into a thin edge through to Sangakkara;Cameron White c ?Sangakkara b Malinga 8 (10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 80;

5.35pm Glenn emails in: "Where do you think Clarke should bat? If he must play, I'd like to see him no higher than 5, and please, please not at 3." Well, Glenn, it seems Clarke is going to open the batting today, he's walking out now with David Warner.
5.30pm The Australians have a team full of Victoria and New South Wales players, which is pretty remarkable in this day and age. Although Shane Watson hasn't actually played a game for NSW yet. We're only minutes away from the first ball! Brydon Coverdale with you on commentary.
5.05pm Australia have won the toss and will bat.
And here are the teams: Australia 1 David Warner, 2 Shane Watson, 3 Michael Clarke (capt), 4 Cameron White, 5 David Hussey, 6 Brad Haddin (wk), 7 Steven Smith, 8 John Hastings, 9 Peter Siddle, 10 Clint McKay, 11 Dirk Nannes.
So, Australia have two debutants - Clint McKay and John Hastings, although it's hard to believe McKay hasn't played a T20 yet.
Sri Lanka 1 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 2 Mahela Jayawardene, 3 Dinesh Chandimal, 4 Kumar Sangakkara (capt), 5 Angelo Mathews, 6 Chamara Kapugedera, 7 Thisara Perera, 8 Suraj Randiv, 9 Lasith Malinga, 10 Muttiah Muralitharan, 11 Dilhara Fernando.
Don't hold us to that batting order - that's just what we've been given!
4.55pm Hello and welcome to the first international match of Australia's home summer. It's not the Ashes, it's Australia v Sri Lanka in a Twenty20 at the WACA. We'll bring you the toss and teams shortly.
 Innings Start
That's a comprehensive victory for Sri Lanka, they really did outplay Australia for the whole match. Early wickets had the Australians on the ropes and Randiv and Perera in particular ensured the target wasn't too high; then Sangakkara and Dilshan guided the chase.
"We got outplayed tonight," Michael Clarke said. "No excuses. They played really well, they played the cross bat shots well on a bouncy wicket."
Man of the match is Suraj Randiv for his three wickets: "Normally I get some bounce ... I got more here than in Sri Lanka."
So, Australia's massive summer of cricket has started on a negative note for the home team. They fielded a slightly weakened side, with Michael Hussey and Mitchell Johnson rested. But this won't do their confidence any good heading in to the three ODIs against Sri Lanka and then, of course, the Ashes. They've now lost their past four Twenty20s, and they haven't won an international in any format since the Lord's Test against Pakistan in July.
Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have been here in Australia warming up for more than a week and it's done them no harm. They will be a handful for the hosts in the one-day series, which starts at the MCG on Wednesday.
That's it for tonight - thanks for joining us. Well played, Sri Lanka!
16.3;6;Smith to Perera, SIX runs what a way to finish the match! Perera has skied an even bigger six over long-on! It really was a huge six, that's sailed about 20 rows back. Sri Lanka have won, and easily;

15.5;?;McKay to Sangakkara, no run nudged away defensively to the off side;
15.4;?;McKay to Sangakkara, no run shorter length, and that's a bit comical as it bounces ever so slowly off the wicket and Sangakkara waits and waits, then leaves it alone. It was 100kph.;

15.2;?;McKay to Sangakkara, no run shorter and slower ball at 118kph, Sangakkara waits on it and bunts it at his feet;

14.3;1;Smith to Perera, 1 run tossed up wide of off, it's been skied over point and lands safely;
14.2;W;Smith to Dilshan, OUT Smith gets a wicket, Dilshan has rather thrown it away there.

11.4;?;Nannes to Sangakkara, no run banged in a bit shorter at 142kph, Sangakkara is happy to sway out of the way of that one;

2.5;1;McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run turned around to fine leg for a single;

2.3;1;McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run he goes for the hook this time and that's skied towards fine leg, half a chance for Nannes but he can't get in there in time and it lands safely;

1.6;4;Nannes to Dilshan, FOUR runs more runs! Great cover drive finds the gap and that's a wonderful over for Sri Lanka;

1.4;4;Nannes to Dilshan, FOUR runs another boundary, Dilshan clips it confidently through midwicket and finds the gap, Nannes has to find the right line pretty quickly here;

0.6;?;McKay to Dilshan, no run beaten outside off again! As it was in Australia's first few overs, Sri Lanka are struggling to pick the bounce;
0.5;1;McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run good length from McKay, Jayawardene nudges to mid on and takes off for a quick single;
0.5;1w;McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 wide bouncer! That one sails over the head of Jayawardene and it's high enough to be called a wide, Sri Lanka are off the mark;
0.4;?;McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, no run driven to cover, Warner does the fielding and prevents a single;
0.3;?;McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, no run beaten again! Well wide of off, Jayawardene launches a big aggressive drive and can't make contact;
0.2;?;McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, no run oh, good ball, that one nips back in and beats the inside edge of Mahela, who was wafting a long way away from his body;
0.1;?;McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, no run wide of off, Jayawardene tries to cut and crunches it down into the ground;

"Big comeback from Australia and they might just about have an outside chance now, if they bowl well. Hastings and McKay will be keys, as Sri Lanka won't have faced them. If they can bowl well, Sri Lanka could be bowled out," Adrian Meredith writes.
And Tushar notes that: "Sri Lanka have never beaten Australia in Perth in any format of the game. This is a great opportunity to set that record straight."
The Australians are out on the field, Peter Siddle is warming up for his first ball in an international match since January. But it's Clint McKay to bowl the first over from the Prindiville Stand End.
