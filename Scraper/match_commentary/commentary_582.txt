6.5;?;Lee to Marshall, no run And very strange. Xavier doesn't even try to hit the free hit delivery. Compact defensive stroke. Lee is bemused and signals to Xavier the free hit signal and smiles. Gayle goes across to have a chat. I guess he didn't see the signal of the no-ball and free hit.;

4.5;?;Lee to Gayle, no run just outside off stump, Gayle covers the off stump and lets it sail through to the 'keeper;
4.4;4;Lee to Gayle, FOUR runs Gayle breaks free with a feisty cut shot. Short and not all that wide, he moved back and across and got into a nice position;

0.4;1w;Lee to Marshall, 1 wide down the legs, and Lee just strays too far with the effort, Marshall is quick to jump into an extravagant leave;
0.3;?;Lee to Marshall, no run oh! Good ball, some swing away, rising well from the length and Marshall is immediately forced to leave it;
0.2;1;Lee to Gayle, 1 run on a length, on the pads, turned to fine leg;

The batsmen are doing stretches
 Innings Start
Stay on for the quotes from the post-match ceremony
Gayle: I thought myself and Xavier started well. But it didn't go well after that. It's up to us as individuals to improve. We can't continue like this. We need to pull our socks up. We were lost wickets regularly and didn't even bat the 50 overs."
Ponting: It was a very good win today. Xavier and Gayle played at the top and it looked like they would score more but we bowled well in the second half of the innings. We played some good cricket. Magnificent innings from Watson. He managed the tempo very well. His bowling was good as well." On is batting. "About time, wasn't it?! It was nice to get some time out there."
Man of the Match : Shane Watson : "It's amazing how things can turn around, from zero to getting my first hundred. I am so lucky to be given a opportunity. It was nice to put my hand up and score some runs. Things are progressing well. A year or so ago it wasn't looking great. "
That's it from us. Good bye and good luck
