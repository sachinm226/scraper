And no respite as the fielders amble out to warm-up ... to a background of fireworks from the top of the O'Reilly stand. England are 8-1 to win this ... tight odds. Smoke drifting across the outfield ...
Innings break Massive hitting from Australia there, murdering England's attack. Quality stuff, very entertaining to watch and they had bighitters right down the order.
England didn't help themselves with some average fielding at times, including two gaffesque drops. Vaughan's return as captain, though, was strangely encouraging - he was upbeat and seemed to be enjoying himself out there and his field placements were decent - for what they were worth, Australia often clearing the field with a record number of sixes.
Now let's see if Australia's bowlers can wipe the smile off his face though - their batsmen certainly had a good go. If this is any consolation at all for England, Australia's total isn't a record for all Twenty20 matches ... Somerset made 250 in 2006.
Martin will be back to take you through the next ten overs.

19.5;2;Anderson to White, 2 runs dropped into space at deep midwicket;
19.4;6;Anderson to White, SIX runs that's into the Ladies Stand there, over long-on, and that extends the sixes record;
19.3;2;Anderson to White, 2 runs Pietersen carbon-copies Lewis's drop earlier when Ponting was on 16 out at long-on. KP grins at the crowd, sheepishly;
19.2;6;Anderson to White, SIX runs huge, huger, hugest! That goes big over midwicket and it's fluffed in the crowd;
19.1;?;Anderson to White, no run yorker, good start but fluffs the chance to run out Symonds at his end;
18.6;2;Flintoff to Symonds, 2 runs worked to long-on and that's some great running from the pair;
18.5;1;Flintoff to White, 1 run short and sharp and that pings off the glove into the grille. Ouch. "Well bowled Andrew Flintoff" announces Nasser Hussain. Flintoff checks if White is OK;

18.3;4;Flintoff to White, FOUR runs rocketed through extra cover off the back foot and that's smashed away, scorcher;

17.6;6;PD Collingwood to White, SIX runs clattered over midwicket and Dalrymple has a one-handed attempt to leap up and get that but it goes over him and just clears the rope.

17.5;1lb;PD Collingwood to Symonds, 1 leg bye slower ball, strays down leg and Symonds can only get a leg on it as it goes to the man up at fine leg;

17.3;1;PD Collingwood to White, 1 run slower delivery and he tries to heave that one over to midwicket, mis-times it and Nixon trotting into the leg-side to field it;

17.1;1;PD Collingwood to White, 1 run gives himself room to cut that down the ground for one;
16.6;2;Lewis to Symonds, 2 runs huge! That's a flat bat swipe right over mid-on;
16.5;4;Lewis to Symonds, FOUR runs straight, but Symonds stands tall and walks back, making room to send that up and over through point;
16.4;1lb;Lewis to White, 1 leg bye tries to hook that one as well, but the ricochet goes in front of gully to Vaughan;
16.3;6;Lewis to White, SIX runs whack! Lovely shot in front of midwicket and that's just inches over the boundary;

14.3;?;Lewis to White, no run wide down the leg side and there's an appeal for a strangle, but it clearly flicked the outside of the pad;
14.2;W;Lewis to Clarke, OUT short, just outside off and that's some sharp work in close from Collingwood, winged right back in over the stumps and Nixon who does the rest. Mix up of the yes, no, wait, sorry variety;Michael Clarke run out (?Nixon/Collingwood) 5 (5m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 83.33;
14.1;2;Lewis to Clarke, 2 runs guided behind point off the back foot and that's good running from Australia;
13.6;1;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run worked off the back foot behind point and that's a relatively good over for England;
13.5;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run driven into his toes. Ouch;

13.3;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run defended first up;
13.2;1;PD Collingwood to Symonds, 1 run straight and shortish, Symonds waits on it and does well to late cut that very finely indeed before setting off quickly for a run;
13.1;W;PD Collingwood to Ponting, OUT down on one knee and tries to flick that high over square leg where Lewis makes no mistake this time, having dropped him on 16. Lewis shows the ball to the crowd... because he can;Ricky Ponting c Lewis b Collingwood 47 (41m 26b 3x4 2x6) SR: 180.76;
12.6;?;Panesar to Symonds, no run pushed up there and that's defended;

12.1;2;Panesar to Symonds, 2 runs flighted up there and that's well driven out to the cover boundary;
11.6;1;PD Collingwood to Symonds, 1 run pushed right up there and Symonds does well to dig that out towards cover;
11.5;1;PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 run Collingwood goes wider, and the batsman tries to cut that but only manages to get the toe-end of the bat on it;
11.4;2;PD Collingwood to Ponting, 2 runs sounded like he'd got hold of that, but in fact he didn't quite time it and that is bunted out to midwicket where it bounces in acres of space;
11.3;2;PD Collingwood to Ponting, 2 runs good start, pushed off the legs to a wide long-on;
11.2;?;PD Collingwood to Ponting, no run on the spot, good delivery and that's driven towards mid-on - midwicket came round and dived on it to stop it;
11.1;4;PD Collingwood to Ponting, FOUR runs loosener, straying sown leg and that's flicked up down the leg-side, too fine for Pietersen who gives chase in vain;
10.6;1;Panesar to Ponting, 1 run pushed up there again and an easy drive to mid-on once more;
10.5;1;Panesar to Symonds, 1 run flighted up there and that's driven to mid-on;
10.4;1;Panesar to Ponting, 1 run dibbled out behind square;
10.3;3;Panesar to Symonds, 3 runs drops that short, wide, and Symonds lobs that lazily over extra cover. Dalrymple wings it back in and there's a chance of a run-out, but Panesar throws to the wrong end;

10.1;6;Panesar to Hussey, SIX runs hello, massive! Hussey down the track and whacks that over the long midwicket boundary - that's huge;
9.6;6;Dalrymple to Ponting, SIX runs checked drive, no follow through at all, and it still has enough legs to go over the head of long-off;
9.5;1;Dalrymple to Hussey, 1 run tossed up again, swept single to the man on the 45;
9.4;?;Dalrymple to Hussey, no run Hussey moves outside leg stump, Dalrymple follows him and also does him in the air, a big swish and miss;

7.4;1;Lewis to Gilchrist, 1 run punched to deep mid-off;

5.2;6;Anderson to Gilchrist, SIX runs in the slot, lofted drive over mid-off which lands a foot over the rope;
5.1;6;Anderson to Gilchrist, SIX runs pulled over deep midwicket ... carnage;
4.6;2;Flintoff to Ponting, 2 runs high high - very high - and Lewis at mid-on waited an age and made a complete hash of it. It was right down his throat and he seemed far too casual, it bounced out of his hands and he couldn't grab the rebound. Numpty, as Mr Miller loves to say;
4.5;4;Flintoff to Ponting, 4 runs driven in the air over the covers - he opened the face there - and although Pietersen just caught it inside the ropes, they ran four anyhow;
4.4;4;Flintoff to Ponting, FOUR runs smacked to the other side, slashed over backward point;

0.5;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run angled to Pietersen at backward point and he tries a pointless hurl at the stumps;
0.4;?;Flintoff to Gilchrist, no run lovely ball, beats Gilchrist's inside edge as he aims a fairly nothing drive off the back foot;

 Innings Start
So the Twenty20 has gone the way of Australia's Ashes campaign - total and utter dominance from the home side, abject humiliation for the visitors. The victory makes it played five, won three for Australia in this form of the game. And now they've put down a marker for the one-day series with England and New Zealand. The positives for England are that Vaughan's comeback was a pretty decent one for him and the sprightly youngster Nixon, 36, looks a real find. The teams line up now to shake hands, Flintoff trying to suppress a smile at the sheer hopelessness of it all. But the real smiles are on the faces of the Australian players - they may have dismissed this as a bit of fun, but tonight they had a lot of fun. Thanks for joining us today - do join us again for the one-day series which gets underway on Friday, when these two teams meet again, this time at the MCG.

6.3;1;Symonds to PD Collingwood, 1 run Collingwood waits and punches the ball to long-on;
6.2;W;Symonds to Vaughan, OUT Vaughan aims a reverse sweep and misses, "that's out" yells the entire commentary team and the umpire agrees. Vaughan looks miffed and seems to suggest he got an edge;Michael Vaughan lbw b Symonds 27 (28m 21b 4x4 0x6) SR: 128.57;

5.5;1;Hilfenhaus to Bell, 1 run worked out to the cover boundary;
5.4;4b;Hilfenhaus to Bell, 4 byes Bell steps to leg, gets a thick inside edge and it shoots past Gilchrist for four. He couldn't have been out to that;
5.4;2nb;Hilfenhaus to Vaughan, (no ball) 1 run slower ball, hit high and straight to Clarke at mid-off ... but it's a no-ball and a free hit ... and Clarke looks utterly cheesed off as well he might;

5.1;1;Hilfenhaus to Bell, 1 run fullish awayswinger squirted into the off side;
4.6;4;Bracken to Vaughan, FOUR runs wide, Vaughan slashes it inches beyond the diving Clarke at cover and there's no man out on the rope;
4.5;?;Bracken to Vaughan, no run slower ball which deceives Vaughan as he looks to run the ball fine on the off;

4.3;?;Bracken to Bell, no run bell opens the face and tries to place it into a gap on the off side but fails;

4.1;W;Bracken to Pietersen, 1 run, OUT turned behind square on the off, Pietersen calls for a second and Harwood scores a direct hit to leave him a foot short ... had he not hit then Pietersen would have made it.

3.2;4;Harwood to Pietersen, FOUR runs fuller, Pietersen hammers it over mid-off and gives the bowler some advice for good measure;
3.1;4;Harwood to Pietersen, FOUR runs short, Piertersen on it quickly and hooks the ball off his nose behind square for four;

2.2;1;Bracken to Vaughan, 1 run pushed to the right of cover and a straightforward single;
2.1;?;Bracken to Vaughan, no run slanted across Vaughan who can't reach it. Somehow that's not a wide, which is daft, and Vaughan laughes;
1.6;1lb;Harwood to Vaughan, 1 leg bye hits the pads going down the leg side, bounces into the covers;
1.5;?;Harwood to Vaughan, no run shortish outside off stump, Vaughan aims a savage swat through the covers and misses;
1.4;4;Harwood to Vaughan, FOUR runs short, and Vaughan swivels and pulls for four, lovely shot. It's as if he's never been away;
1.3;?;Harwood to Vaughan, no run played out to cover;
1.2;W;Harwood to Flintoff, OUT dug in, Flintoff top edges the hook and White holds a simple catch at square leg. A dream, start for Harwood and another nightmare on the way for England so it seems;Andrew Flintoff c White b Harwood 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

0.3;?;Bracken to Joyce, no run squirted into the covers;
0.3;1w;Bracken to Joyce, 1 wide Joyce takes three paces, Bracken tries to bowl wide to thwart him and ends up overdoing it;
0.2;1;Bracken to Vaughan, 1 run flicked to long leg for his first Twenty20 run ... he made a duck in his only other match;
0.1;1;Bracken to Joyce, 1 run run down to third man;
