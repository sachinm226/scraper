Data
India have been outstanding in the field, which is a refreshing change from their previous performances on this tour. A target of 132 probably gives them their best shot at a first win on this tour, since the Boxing Day Test at this venue.
Shiva: "For once Indian bowlers have had a decent game on this tour. Let's see if their batsmen can complement them!"

7.30 pm: Five minutes to the start. The crowd is building at the MCG, and David Warner and Aaron Finch, two powerful Australian openers, are striding out to the middle. Praveen Kumar has the new ball, bowling to Warner from over the wicket.
7.15 pm: The ground staff at the MCG, during a few hours of creativity, has created a design in the shape of Australia in the middle of the ground. So one end of the pitch is roughly in Northern Territory, while the other is in South Australia. Maybe we'll call the two ends the Southern Ocean end and the Gulf of Carpentaria end.
"Dhoni's prolonged insistence not to play Irfan Pathan is inexplicable. He is a proven performer in Australian conditions, and to not play him with this under performing outfit baffles the mind." That's from Faraz, a sentiment shared by many others.
Joy: "I think Dhoni has moved on from being a calm & composed captain and has started reflecting arrogance in his decisions. It's more like we will win with this team only & prove that my decision is correct."
Toss, 7.05 pm: George Bailey has won the toss and Australia will bat again. "Beautiful wicket, looks hard, full of runs," he says.
Australia have made three changes, to give everyone in their squad a go. Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh and Clint McKay are in the XI, replacing Travis Birt, Dan Christian and James Faulkner. Word is that Finch will open with Warner, with Matthew Wade dropping down the order.
India are playing the same side that lost in Sydney. Irfan Pathan still on the sidelines. Rohit Sharma made a first-ball duck in that match. Sidharth Monga asks if he can script a happy ending?
7.00 pm Hello, welcome to ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage of the second Twenty20 international between Australia and India, at the MCG. The hosts lead the series 1-0, and India are still searching for their first win of any kind on this tour of Australia.
The toss is in five minutes, and here's Brydon Coverdale's preview of this game. In the first game in Sydney, David Warner unleashed a monstrous switch-hit that sent the ball flying beyond what should have been the extra-cover boundary for the left-hand batsman. It re-ignited the debate over whether that shot should be allowed. David Hussey thinks it should.
 Innings Start
10.50 pm No major celebrations from Gambhir and Dhoni, a shake of the hands and smiles as they walk off the MCG. India won this game pretty comfortably, and the victory was built by a superb fielding effort that began with Gambhir taking a good catch to dismiss Warner. Gambhir then held the chase together with a measured half-century. He'd be a favourite for Man of the Match but I'd give it to Ravindra Jadeja, for his excellent run-outs from point and an economical spell 3-0-16-1.
George Bailey: "It wasn't as close as it looked. Well short with the bat tonight. Four run-outs is the big difference. We were clearly out-fielded."
MS Dhoni gets a huge cheer as he walks up for the presentation. "The fielding was exceptional. Best fielding side, I've seen. It will be hard to beat this effort. We are a side that relies a lot on a good start, not about the runs, a good, calm start is what we look for. Overall it was a good effort by the bowlers and equally by the top three batsmen."
The Man of the Match is Ravindra Jadeja, for his fielding and spell of 3-0-16-1. He says he was trying to play his natural game, that's all. And a fine game it was.
Thank you for all your emails today. That's all I've got for you today. See you for the triangular series, which begins on Sunday. Cheers.
