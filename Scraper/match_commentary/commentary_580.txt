Data
Australia have reached a very competitive 253 on a slowish track at the SCG, then. Sri Lanka bowled well in patches, and their extra count was impressive for the most part, but good manipulation from the batsmen in working the singles and running the twos well has boosted them to a decent score. Game on, so join us after the innings break for the chase.

2.15pm Here come Gilchrist and Hayden, testing out their cut shots as they hit the flag en route to the middle. Wild cheers but the SCG is far from full here today. Chaminda Vaas to open up. Two slips and umpire Taufel calls "Play"
2.00pm Ponting says: "We'll have a bat first today, mate. It rained pretty early up in town this morning but the radar suggests it may be clear for a few hours. We're well prepared, we've had nearly a week in Sydney, so we're looking forward to it."
Matthew Hayden is back so Brad Haddin is out, while Stuart Clark also misses out, with Brad Hogg coming in. "I'm sure he will do a good job for us," says Ponting of Haddin. Hayden's return is huge for the side, with his batting and also his work in the slips.
Ponting says his back is fine. "I'm OK. I probably wasn't at my best the other day but I've had a lot of treatment. I'm not sure it's that big a deal, I'm OK."
And on the wicket, he says: "It's a bit crusty, it's up to us to get a good total on the board." It looks like it could take spin immediately.
Mahela Jayawardene says of the pitch: "It's been under covers for a while, I hope there's something in it for us." And on Ishara Amerasinghe, who impressed against India midweek, he adds: "He's bowled really well, hopefully he can have a good series."
Should be a good match-up with these teams, Sri Lanka and Sanath Jayasuriya in particular love to play at the SCG.
1.50pm News just in, Australia have won the toss and will bat. What Ricky Ponting has to say about it I'll let you know soon.
Australia look like this: 1 Adam Gilchrist (wk), 2 Matthew Hayden, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Michael Hussey, 6 Andrew Symonds, 7 James Hopes, 8 Brad Hogg, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Nathan Bracken. So, no surprises in there.
Sri Lanka are unchanged from the recent washout, thus: 1 Upul Tharanga, 2 Sanath Jayasuriya, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene (capt), 5 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 6 Chamara Silva, 7 Chamara Kapugedera, 8 Chaminda Vaas, 9 Lasith Malinga, 10 Ishara Amerasinghe, 11 Muttiah Muralitharan.
12.55pm My colleague Brydon Coverdale has been a brick, as Enid Blyton would say, and given us a further weather update: "At the moment it's not raining, though it's a bit overcast and I wouldn't be surprised if there's a shower some time in the afternoon." Check out his preview of the game.
While we're waiting for some news, why don't you get ahead of the game at work. Not doing work necessarily, but rigging yourself up some desktop alerts or if that's too much of an effort have a browse of our online magazine. There's so much on Cricinfo, it's like a bottomless pit of brilliance: stats, history, features on top of the news and match coverage itself.
12.45pm Good afternoon everyone, or indeed morning or evening. If you're hoping for coverage of the latest CB Series match between Australia and Sri Lanka at the SCG, you've come to the right place.
All eyes are on the weather today and hopefully the rain will stay away. Cricket Australia have particular reason to hope it stays dry: they already refunded $3million when the Chappell-Hadlee was rained off in December and they face giving back another $3million if today's match is a washout, as predicted throughout this week.
Thankfully, though, we could be unnecessarily doommongering, as the forecast for Sydney is for only a shower or two. It should be fine, though mostly cloudy, during the day. Fingers crossed they get a game, we've had enough cricket washed out in Sydney including the third women's one-dayer yesterday between Australia and England.
I'm Jenny Thompson and will be bringing you every ball, by ball, and can't wait for a full game of cricket. Both matches this series have been rained off so far.
 Innings Start
Really good spell from Bracken, bowling the majority of his deliveries as slower balls to suit the track, excellent adjustment. Australia then have romped home with this win, more than doubling Sri Lanka's score thanks to some patient bowling and batting too. So Australia record the first result of the series and the Sri Lankans run out to congratulate the Australians.
"It's great to be back," beams Hayden. "Every game we play is a special thing. It's a time I can savour with Adam [Gilchrist]. We got off to a reasonably solid start. 240 was probably a par score. This has been an outstanding performance from Nathan Bracken. We've seen some great ... intellectual bowling tonight so we have to give him a tick there."
"We knew it wasn't going to be easy," says Jayawardene. "A slowish wicket, we knew 240 would be a good score. We were trying to get a good start but lost too many wickets first up. A very disappointing day. We need to concentrate on our basics, come back strongly and show our character."
Here's Ponting. "Gilly played really well, and Clarke played a sensible knock. We got to 250 and I knew that as the game wore on our bowlers would be able to take the pace off the ball.
"I thought our fielding tonight was very sharp," he adds, which is important as it had been under the spotlight.
The Man of the Match is undoubtedly Bracken. "The boys batted very well and gave us a good total to bowl with," he says modestly.
Thanks for joining me today, it's been entertaining if a little predictable from the early stages of Sri Lanka's innings.
