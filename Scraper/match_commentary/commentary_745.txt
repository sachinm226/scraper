Data
Australia finished on 273 for 6 and they'll be extremely pleased with that effort. They were reduced to 104 for 5 before Hussey and Haddin decided they didn't like the direction in which the innings was headed. Hussey, in his first match as captain, rescued Australia with his first ODI century. He finished with 109 off just 90 balls. Haddin played his part too and was the first to open the flood gates with massive hits against the spinners. West Indies will be sorely disappointed at conceding so many after Bradshaw and Taylor had bowled tightly at the start to tie Australia down.
West Indies need 274 to get and we'll be back in 40 minutes with the second innings. Do read Siddhartha Vaidyanathan's bulletin for more on Australia's fightback.

Good morning/afternoon/evening everybody, depending on where you're reading this from. Welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the fourth match of the DLF CUP between Australia and West Indies at the Kinrara Academy Oval in Kuala Lumpur. I'm George Binoy and, with Sriram Veera, I'll be bringing you the events as they unfold.
Today's game starts an hour earlier (1.30pm local time) with the view of getting a result in if rain does play spoilsport later in the evening. This is the first of the second-round matches in the tournament. Australia currently have seven points after two games while West Indies have five and India two. For more details on net run-rates and how the bonus point system works, check out the points table.
There's been a lot of Australian team news ahead of the game. Phil Jaques, Mark Cosgrove and Mitchell Johnson - all the Indian fans can heave a sigh of relief - have returned home. Word is that Ricky Ponting is going to take a rest and Michael Hussey will captain Australia for the first time.
For West Indies, Corey Collymore, who is struggling with an injury to his right thigh, is doubtful for today's game as well. Do read Dileep Premachandran's preview for more news.
Toss: Michael Hussey has won his first toss as captain and Australia will bat.
Team news: Matthew Hayden is playing his first ODI since the NatWest Challenge in England in July 2005 and he will open with Simon Katich, who replaces Damien Martyn in the team. Shane Watson is slotted at No.3 and Andrew Symonds comes it to provide firepower lower down the order. They also have a new look bowling attack. Glenn McGrath, Mitchell Johnson and Brad Hogg are out and Brett Lee, Nathan Bracken and Dan Cullen are their replacements.
West Indies, on the other hand, have made just one change to strengthen their batting. Marlon Samuels has replaced Fidel Edwards - a move perhaps prompted after the dreadful collapse against Australia in the first match.
Play is about to get underway. Australia's Test opening firm of Hayden and Katich are together in ODI colours after 15 months. JeromeTaylor has the new ball and will run in to bowl from over the wicket to Hayden. Lara has one slip and a short midwicket in place.
 Innings Start
Phew! What drama as Australia fought back hard and almost stormed their way back into the game. West Indies were coasting at one point but then contrived to lose a few wickets in a heap, raising blood pressures across the Caribbean before Dwayne Bravo, displaying a cool head, steered them home.
