Data
8.37pm Innings break Brilliant finish from Pakistan. Iftikhar was exceptional. Wonderful late hitting to lift the total to 150. Australia will be pleased but that late flurry gives Pakistan some momentum.
Ashton Agar: "It's a really good wicket. It's flat, it's shiny, the spikes do go in. With the form our batters have shown recently I'll back them in. You could sense there was a bit frustration (between the Pakistan batters earlier). A bit of miscommunication. That's when you know you're on top."
So yet another half-century from Babar and Iftikhar makes his highest T20I score but do they have enough?
Saad Khan: "112 off 72 balls for Iftikhar/Babar while the rest contributed 48 off 48..!!!"
Coops: "Will the Aussies be left to rue that final Richardson over of 22 runs. Massive in the context of the game."
Gnasher will be back shortly to start the chase.

Just a few minutes away from the action...here come the Pakistan openers. Mitchell Starc with the new ball
7.00pm Nido: "Size of boundaries?? I have heard they are rather short comparing with other grounds in Australia" Pretty big - depends how far they bring the ropes in. We should get a high-scoring match
Salal: "What if series is drawn? Would Pakistan be deposed from the helm?" A drawn series would see Pakistan keep the No. 1 ranking
Taimur: "what was the "little bit of confusion" in announcing Pakistan unchanged team? don't leave us dry here !!" Was just between who called heads/tails
Lachlan: "Is the Australian team ever going to experiment a little? Surely they would want to test out their options before the world cup? And the sooner they do it the better!" Think they are taking the view that they want to allow a stable XI to play together for a bit and then try a few things. Still quite a few games before the World Cup. Suspect Stanlake will play in Perth.
6.50pm TariqKGMC: "With Fakhar Zaman out of form in this format, I think Asif Ali can be the best choice to open the batting with Babar Azam. He is a natural stroke maker and can hit the ball big. And also Asif Ali has failed to prove his worth with the bat in the lower middle order, so why not lets try him in the opening slot."
Muhammad Kashif: "Rizwan generally struggles to target the pacers after the powerplay. Seeing Fakhar's form, Pakistan should maybe experiment with Rizwan opening alongside Babar. Haris could then come after the powerplay and target the spinners, as both Agar and Zampa turn the bowl into the left hander."
Yasir G: "Haris Sohail, Rizwan and Iftikar are players of same run a ball category. should have brought Khushdil in place of Iftikhar."
6.40pm Pakistan won the toss and bat (after a little bit of confusion) and have named an unchanged XI
Aaron Finch says he would have bowled first because of the impact that dew can have. Australia are unchanged as well.
So, not much team news to bring you, really!
Australia 1 Aaron Finch (capt), 2 David Warner, 3 Steve Smith, 4 Ben McDermott, 5 Ashton Turner, 6 Alex Carey (wk), 7 Ashton Agar, 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Kane Richardson, 11 Adam Zampa
Pakistan 1 Babar Azam (capt), 2 Fakhar Zaman, 3 Haris Sohail, 4 Mohammad Rizwan, 5 Asif Ali, 6 Iftikhar Ahmed, 7 Imad Wasim, 8 Wahab Riaz, 9 Shadab Khan, 10 Mohammad Amir, 11 Mohammad Irfan
6.35pm Ali Nawaz: "Hello Andrew, Good Morning/ Evening as I am in Dubai now, how you rate Rizwan over Sarfraz?" I've always thought Rizwan is a good player (bit of a cheeky chap, too!) although his challenge is to show he has the gears for T20 cricket.
Abdullah Nadeem: "In my opinion,Pakistan should have to give a tleast one more t20 to Mohammad Irfan.Its not easy to make a come back after 3.5 years that too against strong australian team in their home conditions."
The toss is five minutes away so we'll have all the team news for you then
6.25pm It's the first T20I at this ground but it's known as a good batting venue, although the PM's XI match against the Sri Lankans a couple of weeks ago was a low-scoring affair.
Mustafa Moudi: "4 T20I so far after his Return and he is yet to be dismissed (that too dispite being an Opener). Technically the last time he lost his wicket in a T20I was 21 Months ago against NZ. Warner is just Unstoppable.!!"
6.10pm Rahul: "Pak need to pick Hasnain in their 11 quickly. He has lethal pace and was the star in the CPL recently."
There has been one T20I already today where England let slipping a winning position in Nelson
DanielAlexander: "No 1 T20I Babar Azam now has the highest T20I batting average (51.88), what a champion batsman" Well, technically, it's Najjam Shahzad of Portugal.
Jibran T. Siddi: "Enough chances for Asif Ali. Pakistan should now go with Khushdil Shah. He was one of the best finishers in recent National T20 Cup along with Asif. Deserves a chance."
6.00pm Hello everyone and welcome to the second match of this series from Canberra, the capital of Australia. It was a bit of a false start in Sydney thanks to the weather but the forecast is fine for this evening so we should get a full match. Pakistan are clinging to the No. 1 ranking by their fingernails and the signs weren't great at the SCG before the rain came. Australia, meanwhile, are playing some very good T20 cricket. I'm Andrew McGlashan and along with Alex Malcolm will bring you all the action.
Before we get into today's game it's time to look back...20 years. November 5, 1999 marked the Test debut of someone who would change the way the game is played: Adam Gilchrist. He had a huge impact on the wicketkeeper-batsman role and we spoke to a selection of fellow keepers about what it was like playing alongside or following Gilchrist and produced a video.
 Innings Start
That's it from Canberra. Smith too good and Australia go 1-0 up. Both sides head to Perth for the final match of the series on Friday at Perth Stadium. On behalf of our team, hope you can join us then.
Presentation Babar Azam: "We are disappointed. Steve Smith took the match away. He played a magnificent innings. It's very difficult when we lose early wickets. We have to gain the momentum again. Credit goes to Iftikhar the way he played. It's a good knock."
Aaron Finch: "I thought we were pretty good all day. The way we kept taking wickets throughout the innings was really important because we know how damaging Pakistan can be in the powerplay or at the end so to get wickets consistently I think was the key to the day. We've got guys like Steve, who does what he does better than anyone else in the world."
Steve Smith is the Player of the Match: "It was nice to be there at the end and get the boys home. I thought the bowlers set it up early. It was probably a 170 wicket I reckon at least. They bowled beautifully. Then it was just about timing the run and fortunately I was able to do that tonight."
Australia win by seven wickets with nine balls to spare. That was a clinic from Steve Smith. That's why he's in this team. Nervy chases when they lose early wickets are his bread and butter. He took control and picked Pakistan apart. He didn't get much help but he didn't need it. Pakistan lost this with the bat in reality as 150 was nowhere near enough. Amir and Irfan caused some trouble early getting Warner and Finch but they couldn't stop Smith.
Tridib: "I am almost certain Steve Smith isn't human."
Hamza: "My God, Smith has been unstoppable this year, what has he been eating? The difference between the two teams today was Smith and Smith alone or else Pakistan could have defended this target "
ed: "Chris Martin will be ok so long as Steve Smith is at the other end"

Welcome back, folks. Have Pakistan made a game of this? Safwan: "Given the pasting that Irfan got at the hands of finch in the first T-20, it won't be a bad idea to start with left arm spin of Imad Wasim, try and get finch out with a straighter one. Pakistan's best chance of winning this is to get Finch out early. If he gets going this will be wrapped up within 15 overs!"
