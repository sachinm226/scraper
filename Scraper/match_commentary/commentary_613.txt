So, an exciting, stop-start innings from Australia gets them to a very good total, leaving New Zealand with a lot of hard work to do. 290 is the target for them. Adam Gilchrist set the tone with a typical one-day fifty, Michael Clarke and Andrew Symonds consolidated after a few wickets, and then joined by the energetic Cameron White, Symonds took the bowlers to the cleaners. When it looked like 300 was a possibility, Shane Bond came back from a wayward patch of wides and no-balls to nail three men in three balls, IN the final over, to give New Zealand some sort of boost at the death.

A good start for Australia
 Innings Start
Australia surge to another victory, having outclassed New Zealand in every facet of today's game. The batting clicked, and the level-headed were able to recover after a brief wobble at the top and get it together in good nick at the tail, especially Cameron White and Andrew Symonds, and despite Shane Bond's hat-trick in the 50th over - he became just the second New Zealand bowler to do so after Danny Morrison - Australia settled with a very, very competitive 289.
New Zealand were always under the gun, and their batting just folded on an ideal batting deck. Ross Taylor played another mature innings for his young age, battling with cramps in his left leg, but a lack of support from his teammates ultimately ruined New Zealand's chances of getting close to their target. Its shocking that only two other batsman made it to double figures, and this is an issue that the tourists have to address. Everyone talked about it during the recent Test and ODI series against Sri Lanka, and things havent improved for New Zealand.
Ricky Ponting has given another consummate profession display from his bowlers and fielders, and he rotated the changes well, as we saw with the options of Mitchell Johnson, Cameron White, and Symonds. In all, it was the usual story we've seen for much of the past few seasons - Australian dominance.
Symonds is the Man of the Match for his allround efforts.
Thats all we have for you today, folks, but do join us for our continued live coverage of the third match of this tri-series, between England and New Zealand at this same venue, on Tuesday, January 16. This is Jamie Alter, also on behalf of my co-commentator, Binoy George, signing off and saying thanks for tuning in. Cheers, all!
38.3;W;Symonds to Patel, OUT thats the end of that! Symonds tosses it up invitingly outside off stump, Patel gets a half-stride forward and lofts it down the ground high, high in the air, and Hilfenhaus at long-on squints against the sun and gets under it, holding a neat catch to round off a comprehensive Australian victory;Jeetan Patel c Hilfenhaus b Symonds 4 (4m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80;

37.6;?;White to Gillespie, no run quicker through the air, and full outside leg stump, Gillespie looks to flick but the ball dips on him and he falls over in the shot;

37.2;?;White to Patel, no run quicker delivery on the stumps, Patel gets right behind and defends it solidly;
37.1;W;White to Franklin, OUT and like Johnson a few overs ago, he picks up one with his first ball!

36.6;?;Symonds to Gillespie, no run tossed up outside off stump, and Gillespie presents a quite impressive front foot defence to that delivery;
36.5;W;Symonds to Bond, OUT bowled 'em! Gives it some air, rolling the fingers over it, but it comes out faster than Bond expected, and he plays all over it as the ball quickly slides between pat and pad and disturbs the furniture;Shane Bond b Symonds 2 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40;
36.4;1;Symonds to Franklin, 1 run gives it some more air on off stump, and its flicked to mid-on;

35.6;1;Clark to Bond, 1 run back of a length just outside off stump, Bond defends away from his body and the outside edge runs along the ground to third man, looked like he may have intentionally played it late with the open face, but who's to say, its a tail-ender, after all;
35.5;?;Clark to Bond, no run slower ball, on a fullish length on off stump, and he drives back to Clark;
35.4;1;Clark to Franklin, 1 run good length on middle and leg, he flicks around the corner out to Hilfenhaus at fine leg for one;
35.3;W;Clark to Vettori, OUT as the run rate soars, Vettori chances his arm but holes out to deep square leg! Clark drops one in short of a length on middle and leg, and Vettori swivels and chips it off the pads in the air out to deep square leg, where Hayden, moving from a deepish mid-wicket, covers ground and holds a relatively easy catch;Daniel Vettori c Hayden b Clark 1 (14m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;

33.2;W;Clark to Fulton, OUT another one bites the dust! Back of a good length delivery, very innocuous, it must be said, and Fulton drives off the backfoot in the air above Symonds at short extra cover, who jumps up and gets a hand to it, just parrying it up in the air and holding it easily on the second attempt&;Peter Fulton c Symonds b Clark 37 (59m 44b 1x4 1x6) SR: 84.09;

32.4;W;Hilfenhaus to McMillan, OUT low full toss on off stump, he flicks across the line past midwicket, quickly comes Clarke from the deep, who moves, picks it up and throws it straight onto the nonstriker's end, and gets his man! He didnt have a lot to work with, moving and throwing it on the turn, and looking at one stump, but his brilliance does the rest! McMillan cant believe it, and man, that was some throw;Craig McMillan run out (Clarke) 2 (6m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57;
32.3;?;Hilfenhaus to McMillan, no run good length on the stumps, driven back down the ground and he fields with the outstretched right hand;

31.3;?;Johnson to McMillan, no run back of a length outside off stump, played out to backward point;
31.2;?;Johnson to McMillan, no run better one, a good length delivery that angles past his tame front-foot prod, almost missed kissing the edge of the bat;
31.2;1w;Johnson to McMillan, 1 wide and he's greeted by a bad ball, very, very full and wide of off stump;
31.1;W;Johnson to Taylor, OUT and he strikes first ball! A good length-quick delivery angled across him outside off stump, and Taylor obliges with a flashy drive that takes the regulation outside edge into a diving Gilchrist's gloves, good breakthrough to end a good innings;Ross Taylor c ?Gilchrist b Johnson 84 (114m 82b 10x4 3x6) SR: 102.43;

Hi everyone, this is Binoy George back again, welcome for the run chase. New Zealand need 290 to win at 5.8 per over. Can New Zealand make this into a good contest? Stay tuned for some wonderful action........ Early on Bond got a hat-trick removing White caught at deep midwicket, Symonds caught behind and then Bracken bowled in the final over of the innings.
The first 15 overs will be crucial for the run chase. The Australians are out on the field having some last minute discussions. The batsmen walk out into the middle, Astle and McCullum.
It will be McCullum to take strike to Bracken, a slip and short midwicket close in
