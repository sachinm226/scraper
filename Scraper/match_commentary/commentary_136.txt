Innings break We will take a break and return in 40 minutes time for the run chase.
Dwaine Pretorius has told the TV broadcaster that Australia probably got 10-15 runs more than they should have but the South Africans are pleased with their bowling performance. Australia had three players reach 40 but none reached 50. Rabada took four and Pretorius bowled very well to take 3 for 32. Chris Lynn tells the TV broadcaster they might be 50 short but they will back the bowlers to do the job. Too many starts from the batsmen.
Four wickets for Rabada and Australia ar bowled out with nine balls remaining.

Caleb: "You can't get more plumb than that... absolutely shocking review. You get just the one review in ODI so why are teams obsessed with using it so early in their innings, makes no sense. Look at NZ and Pakistan the other day, Hafeez wasting review early and sure enough Shadab got a shocker and couldn't review. Remember, it is there for howlers."
 Innings Start
Australia win by seven runs and the series is level at 1-1. The home side break a run of seven ODI defeats in a row. A superb performance in the field by them. The captaincy of Aaron Finch was very impressive. He backed his quick bowlers who delivered and Adam Zampa bounced back superbly as well. Has to be said it was a poor chase from South Africa. Faf du Plessis spoke about the batting before the game and it was shown up tonight.
"I'm so tired, so pleased to get the win," says Marcus Stoinis. "Feels like it's been a long day. A tough six months."
"A lot of us said the wheel would turn," says Mitchell Starc. "Everyone is very glad."
How significant is this for Australia? We'll see in the days and weeks to come, but it's something they were desperate for
Faf du Plessis "It's a tough pill to shallow, thought the bowlers were brilliant for the most part. I felt we let ourselves down with the bat, very disappointed. The nature of the wicket and the game was we only needed four-and-a-half an over. We knew they'd have to bring the spinner back. The gamble paid off for them, bowling their seams. We needed one more batter to stay with Dave. They put a great deal of pressure on his. Good teams should close that down. I don't believe that score was worth winning, we let ourselves down. It's a quick turnaround, so we have to leave our disappointment in the dressing room."
Aaron Finch "It's nice, the way we defended was outstanding, The bowlers were relentless. Not sure if it's relief, justification for some hard work. Keeps the series alive. We had to shut it down in the ring, make it hard to score, our quicks are as good as anyone in the world. We held our chances and it went our way. We knew we had to bowl them out, or go close to it. We had to keep rolling the dice. If you let it drift they'd get them in the 45th. Take some risks and it worked tonight. Knew Adam would have to play a big role, he's improved so much over the years. A lot of courage and a lot character."
Finch is also named Man of the Match for his runs and captaincy.
We'll wrap things up there for today. We are set for decider in Hobart on Sunday and we'll be back for that. For now, from Gnasher and Alex, it's goodbye and thanks for joining us.

4.6;?;Starc to Markram, no run full outside off, left alone...encouraging signs for Starc;
4.5;4;Starc to Markram, FOUR runs edged, just wide of second slip! An uncertain prod outside off at a back-of-a-length delivery, healthy outside edge but Finch can't get there with a dive. Would have gone to third slip;

4.2;?;Starc to Markram, no run good length, angled across outside off, left alone;
4.1;W;Starc to de Kock, OUT picks out long leg! Starc strikes early, probably not how he planned. It's a length ball shaping into de Kock, he whipped it with his strong wrists, but never tried to keep it down and Zampa judged the catch well. Didn't go in entirely cleanly, but held on. Picked out the one man in the deep, a bit careless really;Quinton de Kock c Zampa b Starc 9 (12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 75;

2.4;1;Starc to de Kock, 1 run a short ball, de Kock goes deep in the crease and nudges into square leg;
2.3;1;Starc to Hendricks, 1 run big appeal for lbw, a ripping inswining yorker, Hendricks just manages to keep it out. They don't review, and wisely too as it's comfortably missing leg;
