5.40pm, tea A late surge from Buttler has given England a handy score. It was a patient beginning and early wickets saw the tourists in trouble again but first Eoin Morgan and then Gary Ballance played lively innings to give England some progress and Buttler's little cameo at the end has given them a useful score that should be competitive, we'll see how competitive in around 40 minutes...

6.5;W;McKay to Root, OUT full at the pads, Root misses and is struck on the pad, looks pretty straight and given out lbw. We do have reviews available and Root goes upstairs. There were two noises but it doesn't appear as if Root has hit this, nothing on Hot Spot and Hawk Eye has it crashing into leg stump. A very good decision from the umpire and you have to say not the best review from Root. He was done by some inswing and he missed playing across the line;Joe Root lbw b McKay 3 (25m 23b 0x4 0x6) SR: 13.04;
6.5;1w;McKay to Root, 1 wide wide, too wide, a wide;

0.3;?;McKay to Cook, no run tighter line but still wide enough to allow Cook to leave;

0.1;?;McKay to Cook, no run full delivery, swing in a little and takes the front pad around the knee roll, immediate cry for lbw but probably too high;

Clint McKay has the new ball and Alastair Cook is taking strike, play gentlemen...

Oh good heavens we've got an opening ceremony for the one-dayers too. Aboriginal welcome and the national anthems. Simply completely unnecessary. Get on with the game! At least it gets the players out there nice and early so we should start bang on time. Australia are striding out in a new predominantly green kit which is much better than their canary-yellow number.

2.10pm No spinner for England but the way Australia got after Tredwell in the series in the UK perhaps makes that a sensible suggestion? Saying that, Michael Clarke expects spin to play a part in this game and they have a couple of spinning options available in Maxwell and Doherty. England have gone batting heavy with Gary Ballance included, meaning Stokes is down at No. 8 - they will hope that line up can find plenty of runs, and they will surely need them.

Vinix: "I don't like the English top three. The best start those three guys can give the team is 100 in 20 overs and the remaining batsmen has to go berserk to achieve a good total on a good pitch. Should have couple of free flowing batsmen in the top three." There is a Mr K Pietersen available for the World Cup, all being well, but he's rested for this series.

1.50pm The captains are out there for the toss, up goes the coin and Alastair Cook has called correctly and England will bat first. They haven't picked James Tredwell which is a bit of a surprise.

England 1 Alastair Cook (c), 2 Ian Bell, 3 Joe Root, 4 Gary Ballance, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Jos Buttler (wkt), 8 Ben Stokes, 9 Tim Bresnan, 10 Chris Jordan, 11 Boyd Rankin

Australia 1 David Warner, 2 Aaron Finch, 3 Shane Watson, 4 Michael Clarke (capt), 5 George Bailey, 6 Glenn Maxwell, 7 Brad Haddin (wk), 8 James Faulkner, 9 Nathan Coulter-Nile, 10 Clint McKay, 11 Xavier Doherty

Hello and welcome to live coverage of the first ODI from Melbourne as this Ashes tour swings into the one-day leg. England are looking for some much-needed respite on what has so far been a tour of hell following their Ashes whitewash; Australia will be after more of the one-day cricket that saw them dominate England in the UK and then compete very well indeed in India. Both teams will hope for something of a sounding board with the World Cup 12 months away.
 Innings Start
Okay, folks, that's yer lot for today. Brydon Coverdale's report should be your next stop and then Plays of the Day, why not? If you're in England, Sunday is your oyster; those in the Antipodes should slug a green grenade and then get to bed - remember you've got work tomorrow. To each and everyone in between, thanks for your comments, we'll be back again next week. Cheerio!
10.05pm: Another day, another win for Australia, the taste of defeat growing wearyingly familiar for England. Defending a middling target, they had to take early wickets but practically threw away the game along with several chances in the first 15 overs. Aaron Finch cruised to a century and that was plenty for Australia... and he is duly named Man of the Match.
"It's always nice to get a good start to the series, especially at your home ground," Finch says. "It was a good feeling. The way the wicket was, it swung around a bit early, a game of one-day cricket, you do need a bit of luck early, it was nice that it went our way and to contribute to a big partnership with Davey Warner. When you're batting with him it gives you confidence to give it a bit of a belt. He takes a lot of pressure off, the confidence he brings in from Test cricket, I've known him for about 15 years and it never gets boring."
England's captain, Alastair Cook: "I'm disappointed, we were probably about 20 short but we didn't bowl well enough. We wanted to keep it tight, hit the top of off, but we needed to take those chances. The batsmen wanted to get in - Finch and Warner did that - you can't just go off and running straight away but whenever we managed to build a partnership we had a setback. We've got to [manage the squad] this way, we've got a lot of one-day cricket to come and it was pleasing to see Chris Jordan come off. If things come together on the day we can be competitive at the Gabba."
Australia captain, Michael Clarke: "We were a bit sloppy in the field but did enough. I think the momentum has come from putting in the hard work, we played well in the UK and things are coming together. We've got a lot of guys who can bat and bowl, which makes my job a lot easier, in one-day cricket you need to do two things these days. We're just looking from series to series at the moment but we know the World Cup is coming along."
45.4;2;Bresnan to Maxwell, 2 runs back of a length, swatted in front of deep midwicket, they'll get back for two meaning Australia win by six wickets and go 1-0 up in the series;
45.3;?;Bresnan to Maxwell, no run goes full and wide as Maxwell backed away, inside the tramlines, well bowled;

44.3;1;Stokes to Bailey, 1 run continues to pepper the middle of the pitch, flat-batted out to deep midwicket;

42.1;?;Stokes to Bailey, no run pitched up and shaping towards middle and leg, blocked from the crease;
41.6;W;Bresnan to Clarke, OUT got him, another one late in the piece! Clarke went aggressively at the ball, wasn't quite there to drive and it hit high up the bat, looping to mid-off. Cook takes the catch, again thinking to himself 'What if?';Michael Clarke c Cook b Bresnan 43 (64m 42b 6x4 0x6) SR: 102.38;
41.5;1;Bresnan to Bailey, 1 run fuller length, tailing in and flicked behind square, kept to just a single;

41.3;1;Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run short again, pulled through midwicket with a swivel;
41.2;?;Bresnan to Clarke, no run bouncer, not sure if it was a slower ball or just Bresnan's regular pace now, Clarke ducks it;
41.1;?;Bresnan to Clarke, no run comes forward to a length ball, below 80mph now, defends;
40.6;?;Jordan to Bailey, no run one last appeal for Jordan, somewhat forlorn, the ball thudding into Bailey's pads but there was a woody noise as well... bowled better than 1 for 50, though that's small consolation for England;
40.5;2;Jordan to Bailey, 2 runs Bailey goes across his stumps, glances another couple through backward square;
40.4;2;Jordan to Bailey, 2 runs angled in on to the pads, tapped short through square leg, into a gap for two more;

39.3;W;Stokes to Finch, OUT bottom hand comes off the bat, a sliced drive soars down to third man... and, me oh my, Ballance pouches it! A wicket for Stokes, a catch for Ballance and a standing salute for Finch. If the same fielder had taken a much easier chance 113 runs ago, this might have been a different game. Never mind that, though, twas a cracking innings;Aaron Finch c Ballance b Stokes 121 (180m 128b 12x4 0x6) SR: 94.53;

38.4;?;Jordan to Clarke, no run on the stumps, worked into the leg side;
38.3;4;Jordan to Clarke, FOUR runs ripper, extra bounce and edged between keeper and slip for four! Jordan is not so much fresh out of luck as it was never in stock today, a really good delivery had Clarke fencing outside off, it flew quickly, should have been Buttler's but beat him too and raced to the rope with a salty pang;
38.2;1;Jordan to Finch, 1 run in the channel, short of a good length, waits on it and runs one to third man;

37.1;3;Stokes to Clarke, 3 runs pitched up on the stumps and whipped nimbly off his toes through midwicket, it's a long chase out towards the boundary but the ball slows before the rope;
36.6;?;Jordan to Finch, no run length ball, leg-sideish, Finch plays across the line and his hit on the knee roll;
36.5;1;Jordan to Clarke, 1 run angled in towards middle and leg, flicked off the hips to fine leg for a single to the sweeper;

34.2;?;Bopara to Clarke, no run holds its line, nips past the outside edge as Clarke pushes forward;
34.1;?;Bopara to Clarke, no run length ball on off stump, poked defensively back to the bowler;
33.6;1;Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run too full, outside the line of off, driven mercilessly but towards mid-off, Cook does well to prevent it flying past him;
33.5;1;Bresnan to Finch, 1 run on the front foot, dabbed behind point, who can't take it cleanly and they pick up one more;

32.4;1;Bopara to Clarke, 1 run on the stumps, works another single into the leg side;
32.3;1;Bopara to Finch, 1 run length, on the pads, calmly tucked through midwicket for a strolled single - that's his hundred, the first by a Victorian in an ODI at the MCG, remarkably. Finch's second in one-dayers and a mature knock, albeit with a bit of luck early on;
32.2;1;Bopara to Clarke, 1 run comes forward and punches a full ball down the ground to long-on;
32.1;?;Bopara to Clarke, no run full and floated up on off stump, Clarke plays over the top of it and nearly yorks himself, the ball just skidding past off stump;
31.6;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run angled in, over the top of middle and off, defended. Still the MCG waits on Finch...;
31.5;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run good-length delivery in the channel, watchfully allows this one through to the keeper;
31.4;2;Bresnan to Finch, 2 runs on a length outside off, pushes at it and steers behind the diving man at point, third man comes up but they'll get two;

30.4;2;Jordan to Finch, 2 runs full on the stumps, driven into the leg side and they run hard for two;
30.3;1;Jordan to Clarke, 1 run back of a length, wide enough for a cross-bat shot again, this time Clarke connects and finds third man;
30.2;?;Jordan to Clarke, no run tries to cut and mistimes it to backward point, wasn't short enough for a cut;
30.1;?;Jordan to Clarke, no run length ball defended in the crease in front of off stump;
29.6;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run similar delivery, knocks this down into the covers;
29.5;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run full length at the off stump, Finch plays slightly across it and gets struck on the pad, not out given to the appeal, a little high perhaps;

28.5;?;Jordan to Clarke, no run back of a length and punched to point;
28.4;W;Jordan to Watson, OUT full and it nips back past the drive and knocks out off stump. Reward for Jordan who has been impressive despite England's predicament.

13.5;?;Stokes to Warner, no run length ball, played back to the bowler;
13.4;?;Stokes to Warner, no run Warner tries to fiddle one down to third man, there's a thin nick but does it carry? Buttler holds the ball up in a sort of half-celebration, umpire Fry asks square leg if it was a fair take... There seems to be agreement and England engage in some high-fiving and bum tapping. Then the on-field umpires decide to call for a replay; the first angle seems to show the ball going straight in, the one from mid-on is a little less clear - remember the foreshortening - though I think Buttler's gloves are underneath it... but the umpires are no longer happy and Warner, who had strode all the way to the boundary's edge, is recalled to the middle!;
13.3;1lb;Stokes to Finch, 1 leg bye pitched up on leg stump, swings across the line and misses, a leg bye rolls in front of square;

9.6;6;Jordan to Warner, SIX runs slightly full, around off stump, KABOOM! Warner goes straight down the ground, grinding up five dots balls and taking six from Jordan's final delivery. Timed;
9.5;?;Jordan to Warner, no run good length on the stumps, carefully defends back down the pitch;
9.4;?;Jordan to Warner, no run Warner swings hard, doesn't get hold of a chopped on-drive... but it drops a yard or two short of Ballance at mid-on! Dame Fortune is giving England a frosty shoulder at the moment, and no mistake;

8.4;?;Bresnan to Warner, no run angled across on a length, Warner blocks;
8.3;3;Bresnan to Finch, 3 runs full and wide and launched over the inner ring, the ball actually plops and stops short of the deep cover boundary but they get three;
8.2;4;Bresnan to Finch, FOUR runs right, enough with the defending, this time a straight drive whistles back past Bresnan, he tried to get his feet in the way but nearly lost a toe in the process... Finch is purring like a Bugatti out there;
8.1;?;Bresnan to Finch, no run length, tight around off stump, Finch doffs his cap and defends;
7.6;?;Jordan to Warner, no run Warner on the attack, slaps a length ball back down the track, on the up and Jordan sticks out his left paw... drops it! Another one goes down, just an instant reaction, three-quarters of a chance, maybe, though he saw it early and seemed to watch it into the hand, only for the ball to pop straight out;
7.5;?;Jordan to Warner, no run fired through in the channel, 87mph/140kph, cut fiercely off the back foot but Morgan snags it on the bounce diving to his left;
7.4;?;Jordan to Warner, no run slightly full, on the stumps, punched to leg;

6.2;3;Rankin to Warner, 3 runs that's a lovely stroke, just a round-arm jab through midwicket from a length ball on the stumps, manufactured the angle but won't quite get four, Bresnan dives, almost in slow motion on the boundary, to just reel it in;
6.1;?;Rankin to Warner, no run oh hello, here's David Warner, still out there but only having faced one ball in the last three overs... gets forward to defend;
5.6;?;Jordan to Finch, no run keeps Finch honest, off stump on a length, gets across to defend;
5.6;1w;Jordan to Finch, 1 wide slips down the leg side, past bat and pads - another wide;
5.5;2;Jordan to Finch, 2 runs digs this in short, Finch takes it on and windmills a tennis smash past mid-on for a couple - odd shot but reasonably effective;
5.4;?;Jordan to Finch, no run pitched up and angled back in, beats the bat on the inside and thumps into pad, umpire Simon Fry squints and shakes his head but England review. May be a touch of desperation about this, having missed Finch a ball earlier, the ball probably doing too much to overturn an on-field call... and yes, that's the rub, a decent shout but only clipping the top of leg, so Finch endures;
5.3;4;Jordan to Finch, FOUR runs edged... and it flies through newly vacant second slip! Would you Adam and Eve it, Jordan bellows in frustration, he got a bit of extra bounce and clipped the shoulder of the bat, wide of the diving Cook but would have nestled straight in second's bread basket;

4.4;4;Rankin to Finch, FOUR runs wide of the off stump this time and clubbed through backward point, meaty connection from Finch, that'll be four more wide of third man;
4.3;4;Rankin to Finch, FOUR runs leg side again, short and served up on Finch's sizeable hips, he tucks into the buffet with a flick to fine leg;
4.3;1w;Rankin to Finch, 1 wide strays down the leg side, Finch plays across the line and misses but it's a wide;
4.2;?;Rankin to Finch, no run pitched up a little further, outside off stump and left alone;

3.4;2;Jordan to Finch, 2 runs uppish drive, straight to mid-off... who drops it! Shocker from Gary Ballance, straight through the hands as a toe-ended punch flew firmly but not viciously straight to him. Got to take those, Jeff;

2.1;?;Rankin to Warner, no run angled across, slightly back of a length, Warner swishes across the line and misses;
1.6;?;Jordan to Finch, no run banged in on a length around off stump, prodded into the covers, another dot to Jordon, who came back well after starting with consecutive wides;
1.5;?;Jordan to Finch, no run good line, probing just outside off, pace up around 88mph/141kph as Finch gets a stride in and leaves;
1.4;?;Jordan to Finch, no run goes a touch wider on the crease, room for Finch to swing the arms but he bullies the ball into the ground, short on the off side;
1.3;?;Jordan to Finch, no run squares Finch up slightly, angled in and he jabs the ball in front of square, the bat turning in the hands;

Pocket rocket David Warner and backpack bully Aaron Finch are out in the middle, Boyd Rankin has one of the new balls in hand.
Morning/afternoon, AG here. England are trying to find their way out of the seven circles and have 269 to defend - a respectable score, largely built through half-centuries from Gary Ballance and Eoin Morgan. Australia's response will give us an indicator of whether the back-to-back 6-1s of 2009 and 2010-11 or the Collingwood/Dalrymple/Plunkett Memorial Series of 2006-07 are our precedents...
