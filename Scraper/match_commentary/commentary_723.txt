 Innings Start
So Australia wins the Test by taking full advantage of Graeme Smith's generous last day declaration
And consequently take the series two nil
South Africa could feel a bit hard done by: with most of day four lost to rain, they were forced into a situation where they had to risk losing a match that they had controlled so much of in order to have a chance of winning
And on a pitch that had remained in tact under overcast skies all match, it was always going to be difficult to defend such a moderate target
The South African bowling on the final day was pedestrian at best, and rarely anything that troubled two of the best batsman in the world in Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden
