2pm Welcome back, if you went anywhere that is, we're nearly ready for the chase. My computer knows how important this 50 overs is, the series decider in fact, as it just overheated with the excitement. Australia have set New Zealand a big challenge, but it's now time for the visitors to step up and show whether their batsmen can cope with the pace. They reckon they can, so stand by and we'll see if they can. Just a reminder, before we kick off again, that if you're heading to the MCG Test next week take down any old kit which will be put to great use in East Asia and the Pacific regions. Demand for cricket kit is exceeding supply out there, which is obviously good news in many ways, as the game takes off.
50 overs What an innings by Ponting, who has cruised to 134 not out, adding 97 to his previous highest ODI knock here in front of his home crowd. He's led the team well following some tight bowling from New Zealand, to drive them to a highly competitive score. New Zealand's batsmen will have to be at their best if they are to chase this down and retain the title. It's been exciting stuff here so far in Hobart, so don't dare miss the chase in half an hour's time.

9.50am Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone and welcome along to the third and final one-dayer in Hobart where Daniel Vettori has won his third successive toss, but has invited Australia to bat for the first time this series.
This match is a winner-takes-all affair with New Zealand the holders, and Australia one-up heading here following the washout in Sydney. The home side took some psychological points away from reducing New Zealand to 3 for 30 in that game, but you can never write their rivals off.
Good news weather-wise, the showers from this morning have cleared and play is expected to start on time... which is pretty soon, so kettle-lovers click that switch now, the rest of you stay tuned.
It can't come as much of a surprise that New Zealand have left out the out-of-sorts Lou Vincent, which will mean a batting reshuffle, while Chris Martin is also omitted, but will carry the drinks as 12thers. In come Matthew Sinclair and Mark Gillespie.
 Innings Start
Australia, then, win the game convincingly by 114 runs and with around 15 overs to spare. They have regained the Chappell-Hadlee Series with a 2-0 win, which is only just given how well they have played in the tournament. I wonder who will be the Man of the Series, my money's with Ponting for his two centuries. Yes, indeed it is Ponting who picks up the Player of the Match and the Series. Read Peter English on what it means to him, and for a full recap of the day's play.
A modest Ponting told Nine. "It's been a good couple of weeks to tell the truth. I feel like I've played OK. It's been a great series, it always is and once again Australia's played some great cricket so it's been an exciting week for us.
"I think the build-up this week has always been about this game being a final, we have prepared well for it, you've seen a bit more intensity today, that's what I expect for the game.
"We pack up early to go straight to Melbourne before we start training for the next series. India have got a bit of confidence and I know those guys are looking forward to that series."
So, little time off before the next international series, and India are in town already. We'll be back on Boxing Day, tune in then if you get the chance. Until then, thanks very much for joining us over this series.
