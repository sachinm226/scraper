6.05pm: Fantastic comeback by Australia, for a score of 274 didn't look likely at the end of 30 overs. It was slow going before Haddin and Voges came together for a stand of 111 at more than a run a ball.West Indies lost the plot and couldn't maintain the pressure. Their body language and fielding didn't look encouraging at all.
Voges has done enough to get a regular gig in the line-up. The selectors should be impressed with this innings considering he came in with Australia struggling a bit. Join us in half an hour for the chase. It's going to take a lot for the West Indies to chase this, since they're short on confidence.
Jason: "'Catches win matches' is the saying. Voges dropped and has now basically won Australia the match. That said, Faulkner is probably upset he didn't get in sooner with the Weat Indies bowling being as poor as it was aside from Narine."

 Innings Start
Voges is the Man of the Match: " I think new players bring fresh energy. It was also great for Marsh and Haddin (he's not new) to get an opportunity."
Watson: "We held our nerve. Voges was absolutely amazing. They were cruising along at one stage and I knew they will take risks at some stage. I'm very excited to get on that plane to India."
West Indies won't be on that plane back home yet. There's the T20 at the Gabba on Wednesday. Their last chance to salvage a win in what's been a miserable tour. Do join us for that. Thanks for your company today. Cheers!
