Mukesh: "I switched on the TV hoping to see Warner breaking Brian Lara's record. Left the room for a minute and the next minute Australia declare! Why?" -- Because you left the room!
GK: "I think there are a few more factors; T20 has unlocked a few more strokes, even today Warner pulled out some shots that would usually be unthinkable, as well as the obvious bat technology. The sticks used prior to the 2010s were massively different. There's also the professionalism element. These blokes play and train much harder than even players a decade ago. Warner scored nearly 100 just in singles. The physical fitness required to do that involves an amazing amount of support and sports science"
Hardik S: "Just like to highlight this. Bradman also had a 299*. His partner got run out." -- Yup. And Martin Crowe was dismissed on 299, against Sri Lanka.
James : "Warner halted just short of Hammond Hanif and Jayasuriya."
5.44pm Australia declare at 589 for 3. That leaves Pakistan somewhere around 26 or 28 minutes to bat out until dinner. Brian Lara's Test-record score of 400* stays safe for now. Warner's 335* is the tenth-highest Test score of all time.

106.3;?;Yasir Shah to Warner, no run fuller, on off stump, blocked back to the bowler;

103.5;2;Shaheen Shah Afridi to Warner, 2 runs another edge through that region. Half-forward to a length ball outside off - he wants to push into the covers, ends up nicking it thickly instead.

103.1;?;Shaheen Shah Afridi to Warner, no run back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region;

99.1;1nb;Muhammad Musa to Warner, (no ball) another no-ball. Length ball on off stump, blocked into the covers;
98.6;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run squared up. Lovely ball, flat and quick, but on a good length on middle and leg. Smith plays the trajectory rather than the length and goes back to work it into the leg side. Turns sharply and rolls into the backward point region off the outside edge;
98.5;1;Yasir Shah to Warner, 1 run good ball, a bit of quick turn from an off-stump line, towards the pads. Worked behind square for one;

96.6;1;Yasir Shah to Warner, 1 run big shuffle across, and a long, lonely shout for lbw from the bowler. Was looking to work it leg side, and the ball spun past his inside edge and hit his pad. Or was there a bit of bat on it? The ball rolls into the backward square leg region, and there's no leg-byes signal. Pakistan choose not to review;
96.5;?;Yasir Shah to Warner, no run full, slanting away from off stump. Warner is hurried into a front-foot defensive, and the ball slides into the leg side off the inner half of the bat;

96.2;4;Yasir Shah to Smith, FOUR runs shot! Labuschagne scored a lot of runs with this shot off Yasir, and now Smith shows he's just as good at it. Flighted ball, a touch too full on off stump, and Smith whips it away between mid-on and midwicket;

95.1;1nb;Muhammad Musa to Warner, (no ball) gone! But wait, no, he's overstepped! Full, fifth-stump line, and Warner doesn't get forward to drive, just throws his hands at it. Ends up slicing it straight to gully, at shoulder height, but umpire Illingworth's arm goes up straight away. What have you done, Mohammad Musa?;

 Innings Start
Innings break It looks like Australia have enforced the follow on. Yasir gets huge applause from the crowd and hugs from his teammates. He told the interviewer on the way off that Babar gave him motivation and belief that he could do it during their century partnership.
Jo: "Oh man Lyon's frustration was palpable taking that catch. And with it sealed himself a wicketless innings, must be the first one for him at Adelaide in a while. The scorebook will lie today."
Thomas: "Lyon would have been well within his rights to drop that one. Deserved a wicket if not 3!"
Pakistan will bat again. They need to make 287 to try and make Australia bat again in the match. Bambora: "Hope to See New Opening Pair, Shah & Abbas !!!"
