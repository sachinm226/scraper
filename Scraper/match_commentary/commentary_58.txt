Warren: "I hope selectors don't get all excited and believe they've found the answers to Australia batting woes in Burns. The fact is ... it's a second string attack at home ... and Burns didn't deliver previously against top opposition. " Not sure he got much of a chance to be honest, Warren
 Innings Start
1.16pm Innings break That's the end of the innings. Kusal Perera will not bat. Australia have not enforced the follow on. They will bat again. The openers race off to get prepared. Starc gets his 10th five-wicket haul in Test matches. A great return to form.
Brent: "Some wind in the sails for Starc after a difficult summer. Hope he can carry this through to the World Cup"
Paul: "STARC!!!!! when was the last time he got 5fer....???" That's his first five wicket haul since the first innings of the first Test against South Africa in Durban in March last year. He took nine in total in that game.
Scott: "Why would Aust not enforce the follow on? Do they require further batting practice? " It's 32C degrees, headed towards 35 in Canberra. Pitch is flat. Build a lead of 500 and give the bowlers a break.
Alan: "Good decision to bat. Gives Khawaja and others another opportunity. Great stuff from Starc. It's been coming for a while despite the keyboard warriors calls to drop him. "
Davey W: "Presumably all the superannuated ex-players talking down Starc's lack of wickets will now criticise this five-fer for being expensive?"

67.1;W;Labuschagne to Dickwella, OUT that's pretty straight, and given lbw! Misses the sweep, but he has called for the review. A full delivery, pitches around middle. Ah, has this taken the glove before the pad? There's a very small murmur on Snicko. Is that enough to overturn? Third umpire rocking and rolling this. Says it's not conclusive. Taking shows it's hitting the top of middle so that stays on-field!;Niroshan Dickwella lbw b Labuschagne 25 (42m 22b 2x4 0x6) SR: 113.63;

60.1;1;Starc to Dickwella, 1 run full outside off, pushed firmly into the covers;

59.5;W;Lyon to C Karunaratne, OUT and another, thick inside edge which loops to leg slip! Regulation stuff from Lyon, but lovely bowling.

58.4;?;Starc to Dimuth, no run short, climbs down the leg side, not too far from the glove;
58.3;1;Starc to Dickwella, 1 run over the wicket, back of a length at off stump, pushed into the covers;
58.2;W;Starc to Dhananjaya, OUT what's happened here? He's out hit wicket I think! It's the short ball again, Dhananjaya is beaten for pace as he tries to pull. The ball glances off the glove or helmet and then as the bat swings around it clatters into the top of the stumps. Must have taken the helmet because Paine caught it. Either way, it's out. Not sure why Dhananjaya hung around, really, but was a very quick confirmation from the third umpire. Was clearly in the motion of playing the stroke, which is what's required for hit wicket;Dhananjaya de Silva hit wicket b Starc 25 (88m 63b 2x4 0x6) SR: 39.68;
