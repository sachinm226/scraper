Data
The England openers race off straight away, followed by the rest, and Broad raises the ball to the crowd again. A few more boos. It has been a superb performance from him. England will be delighted to keep Australia under 300, although 295 is a few more than looked likely at 132 for 6. Now it's all about the new ball again. Harris, Johnson and Siddle verses Cook, Carberry and Trott. If England get a solid base, they will be well placed for a lead.
97.1;W;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run, OUT he's gone! Excellent from Carberry. Haddin jabbed a full ball into the off side and wanted two, but he never had a chance once Carberry picked up the ball cleanly running in from deep point. It was an okay throw, a slightly awkward take from Prior who did very well to get the ball down onto the stumps;Brad Haddin run out (Carberry/?Prior) 94 (261m 153b 8x4 1x6) SR: 61.43;
96.6;?;Broad to Lyon, no run that's an excellent short ball, 85mph/136kph, and Lyon flinches as he gets out of the line;
96.5;?;Broad to Lyon, no run beats the outside edge, short of a length and it rises past Lyon who pulled his bat away but was beaten;
96.4;?;Broad to Lyon, no run full outside off, left alone, Prior takes by his boots;
96.3;1;Broad to Haddin, 1 run short again, outside off, cuts in front of square to deep cover;
96.2;?;Broad to Haddin, no run this is shorter and a touch quicker, Haddin tries a repeat shot and is beaten this time;
96.1;4;Broad to Haddin, FOUR runs cracking shot from Haddin, short ball and he disdainfully pulls it through straight midwicket...he saw that very early;
95.6;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run well played, short of a length, sharp delivery, but he hops into line and defends to the on side;
95.5;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run big appeal for a glove to the keeper as Lyon drops his hands, but England opt not to the review...may have brushed the back arm;

94.1;?;Broad to Haddin, no run backs away to leg, doesn't make contact as he aims through the off side again;
77.6;3;Swann to Johnson, 3 runs rocks back to a shorter ball and adds more runs now as he cuts this behind point;
77.5;4;Swann to Johnson, FOUR runs that is the fifty for Mitchell Johnson, and quite a way to bring it up, he has just lofted this beautifully over cover, a well-controlled shot really and it bounces safely away for four;
77.4;?;Swann to Johnson, no run a little shorter from Swann but Johnson's cut can't find the gap;
77.3;?;Swann to Johnson, no run he wants the single now, nudges one to square leg and takes off but is turned back, nearly slips over on the pitch but all's well that ends well;
77.2;?;Swann to Johnson, no run flighted on the pads, Johnson bunts it away, happy to wait for his fifty;
77.1;?;Swann to Johnson, no run drifting in and straightening off the pitch, Johnson defends;
76.6;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run not exactly express pace from Tremlett, 126.6kph that clocked at, he's perhaps tiring at the end of the day, and Haddin again defends;

76.2;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run defended safely this time;
76.1;4;Tremlett to Haddin, FOUR runs lovely shot, Haddin drives this straight back past Tremlett - who has replaced Root - and it runs away to the long-off boundary, so well timed;
93.6;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run well played by Lyon, blocks a full delivery up to mid-off;
93.5;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run another short one, this one gives Lyon a glancing blow on the shoulder/back and loops through to Prior;

93.1;3;Anderson to Haddin, 3 runs steps away to leg, gives himself room, then flays a back-of-a-length delivery through the off side...excellent work from Carberry on the rope to prevent the boundary;
92.6;W;Broad to Harris, OUT six for Broad...all rather casual. Harris tries to leave a length delivery outside, can't get his bat out of the line fast enough and the ball runs off the back to Prior;Ryan Harris c ?Prior b Broad 9 (24m 17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 52.94;
92.5;?;Broad to Harris, no run full at the stumps, punched firmly to mid-on;

75.6;?;Swann to Johnson, no run defended away to the off side;
75.5;4;Swann to Johnson, FOUR runs I think the term for that shot is "whack". Johnson goes down on one knee and slog sweeps this over midwicket, it bounces over the boundary to take him to the brink of a half-century;
75.4;?;Swann to Johnson, no run flattish and straight, no real spin, and it's defended;
75.3;?;Swann to Johnson, no run again Johnson goes back in his crease and defends;

74.5;?;Root to Johnson, no run stays upright and defends as the ball skips on around off stump;
74.4;?;Root to Johnson, no run angled in towards the off stump, Johnson shows it the maker's name;
74.3;1;Root to Haddin, 1 run stays back and nudges to midwicket, there's a note of panic in the call and Bell's throw isn't far from causing Johnson a mischief but they get the single and Brad Haddin goes to fifty in his 50th Test;
74.2;?;Root to Haddin, no run skids through a little low, Haddin drops his bat on it in front of the stumps;
74.1;2;Root to Haddin, 2 runs touch short, on leg stump and Haddin tucks this off his hips, races back for a second;
91.6;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run gets squared up, he was shaping to play something expansive through the leg side, the outside edge squirts away through gully so he keeps the strike;

89.5;?;Anderson to Harris, no run left alone outside off;
89.4;2;Anderson to Harris, 2 runs solid drive, really solid straight drive from Harris that is almost a low return chance to Anderson, but he was never really going to get it. The ball pulls up inside the rope but the batsmen only take two - Harris seems intent on protecting Haddin, as if he's a nightwatchman;
89.3;?;Anderson to Harris, no run worked away to point and Harris can't find the gap;
89.2;?;Anderson to Harris, no run beaten, comprehensively! Anderson gets one to straighten just ever so slightly, and Harris can't get bat on ball;
89.1;3;Anderson to Haddin, 3 runs more runs for Haddin late in the day, he's just leant on this one that was swinging down leg, and the timing is such that it races away through midwicket and he almost picks up a boundary;
88.6;2;Tremlett to Harris, 2 runs expansive sort of a drive from Harris to get off the mark, through the off side;
88.5;?;Tremlett to Harris, no run nudged away towards the off side;
88.4;?;Tremlett to Harris, no run driven back towards the bowler;
88.3;?;Tremlett to Harris, no run fullish outside off and this one beats the bat, which hits the ground as it passes the ball - England's cordon are mildly interested in an appeal, Tremlett not even mildly, and the umpire agrees with Tremlett;
88.2;?;Tremlett to Harris, no run Tremlett gets some away swing now, at 131kph, but it is left safely alone;
88.1;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run there's a Sharapova-like grunt from Tremlett as he bangs this one in, but his effort is to no avail - it doesn't get up much and is nudged away safely towards square leg;
87.6;?;Anderson to Harris, no run Harris gets a sighter outside off, he leaves it alone;
87.5;W;Anderson to Siddle, OUT and there is the edge! Anderson deserved that, he had beaten Siddle a number of times and this one just moved a fraction away and Siddle's defensive push is collected low to the ground at first slip;Peter Siddle c Cook b Anderson 7 (20m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.88;
87.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run beaten outside off, Anderson is bowling some very handy deliveries here with the second new ball but just can't find the edge;
87.3;1lb;Anderson to Haddin, 1 leg bye swinging down the leg side and Haddin can't get much on that, just a bit of thigh;

86.4;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run straight drive from Haddin and almost gets his partner into trouble, it ricochets off the outstretched right hand of Tremlett and almost back onto the stumps, I'm not sure if Siddle was back in his ground;
86.3;?;Tremlett to Siddle, no run Tremlett attacks the stumps, Siddle defends them;
86.2;1;Tremlett to Haddin, 1 run clipped off the pads for a single to Trott at fine leg;
86.1;?;Tremlett to Haddin, no run left alone outside off first up;
85.6;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run beaten outside off, really lovely bowling from Anderson, it has just swung too much for Siddle;
85.5;4;Anderson to Siddle, FOUR runs Siddle is happy to play his shots when the opportunity arises, and he jumps on one that is just a touch short, pulling confidently through midwicket and it runs away to the boundary;
85.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run straighter this time and Siddle works it to leg;
85.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run good bowling, lovely outswing and late enough to draw Siddle in, there's a prod that very nearly results in an edge behind;
85.2;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run some outswing now from Anderson and Siddle leaves it alone;
85.1;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run Anderson goes fullish just outside off, Siddle offers it the full face of the bat;
84.6;?;Broad to Haddin, no run Broad again searching for the edge, Haddin defends to point;
84.5;1;Broad to Siddle, 1 run clipped away through leg, they think about two and then think better of it;

84.3;?;Broad to Siddle, no run Broad is searching for the edge on off stump but Siddle defends;

83.3;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run pushed away to cover for a quick single;
83.2;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs classic off-drive here, Haddin has just given that the full face of the bat and slammed it straight down into the ground and away through mid-off, a little too full perhaps from Anderson;
83.1;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs edge from Haddin but this one runs safely wide of third slip and away to third man;
82.6;W;Broad to Johnson, OUT Broad gets his fifth! That's the end of a terrific fighting partnership, and it ended thanks to the new ball and Stuart Broad's swing, he curves this one back in to the left-hander, Johnson tries to play straight but it nips between bat and pad and clobbers the middle stump.;Mitchell Johnson b Broad 64 (143m 134b 6x4 2x6) SR: 47.76;
82.5;?;Broad to Johnson, no run full again and Johnson drives to mid-off, can't find the gap;
82.4;?;Broad to Johnson, no run that's the way Broad might just get Johnson, swinging it in and then getting the odd one to move the other way - this one does just that and beats Johnson's outside edge;
82.3;?;Broad to Johnson, no run stifled appeal now as Broad swings it in but this one is swinging down leg;
82.2;?;Broad to Johnson, no run tempted again but he shoulders arms this time;

81.2;2lb;Anderson to Haddin, 2 leg byes down leg side now and Haddin tickles it away past Prior for a couple of leg byes;
81.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run uppishly driven by Haddin, shouts of 'catch it' from England but this bounces well short of mid-off;
80.6;?;Broad to Johnson, no run this one goes the other way, lovely ball from Broad, and it beats the bat of Johnson;
80.5;2;Broad to Johnson, 2 runs Johnson goes for it now, just a chip really, over square leg and it bounces away towards the boundary but is collected by fine leg running around;
80.4;?;Broad to Johnson, no run again curling in to the left-hander, who drives to mid-on again;
80.3;?;Broad to Johnson, no run big appeal from Broad for lbw, but that one is immediately turned down and there's not even a conference between the England players, that's how they viewed that one. There was a big inside edge, but it was a good ball, full and swinging in;
80.2;?;Broad to Johnson, no run perhaps a hint of inswing there for Broad, Johnson drives from an off-stump line to mid-on;

54.5;6;Anderson to Haddin, SIX runs that'll have Anderson muttering to himself, too, dragging the ball down and encouraging Haddin to swat the ball over deep square leg, just a pirouette and a flick but the ball comes right out of the middle and sails over the rope;

48.1;1lb;Broad to Haddin, 1 leg bye big, vociferous shout for lbw from Broad here as Haddin walks across to work it fine, but Dharmasena is not at all interested.

46.1;?;Broad to Haddin, no run good line to begin with, just outside off, and Haddin defends;

Stuart Broad is back, looking for his fifth.
 Innings Start
What an innings that was. At 82 for 2 it seemed pretty steady, then the hostile brilliance of Johnson, the canny spin of Lyon, the smart captaincy of Clarke and some batting that verged in the inept at times has led to this. Australia lead by 159 and there are 25 overs, light permitting, left today. Will be interesting to see who England put up for the press conference tonight. Maybe the physio?
52.4;W;Siddle to Broad, OUT all out! Broad goes for the pull again, but this time deep square makes ground towards deep midwicket to hold a good catch. They check the no-ball, again, and it's fine;Stuart Broad c Rogers b Siddle 32 (81m 45b 3x4 0x6) SR: 71.11;
52.3;?;Siddle to Broad, no run short of a length on off stump, defended;

51.2;?;Lyon to Broad, no run touch short, driven off the back foot to cover;
51.1;2;Lyon to Broad, 2 runs nicely driven off the back foot through the off side, but Anderson has to get a move on then dive to complete the second. If Lyon had taken the ball at the stumps that would have been close;
50.6;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run short and down the leg side, Anderson plays at it but no touch;
50.5;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run flicks at this on the back foot, goes into the leg side;

48.6;1lb;Johnson to Broad, 1 leg bye slips a full one down the leg side, takes the pad to fine leg;
48.5;?;Johnson to Broad, no run boy, this has been a world-class spell of hostile stuff, Broad fends at other one in front of his face;
48.4;2;Johnson to Broad, 2 runs over the wicket now, full at off stump, Broad is caught on the crease as he drives and the ball comes off a thick inner part of the bat through square leg...as to dive completing the second run;
48.3;?;Johnson to Broad, no run fuller this time, but still back of a length, defended to point;

47.3;?;Harris to Anderson, no run round the wicket, full, Anderson gets an inside edge into his pads;

47.1;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run defended to the off side;
46.6;?;Johnson to Broad, no run defended into the off side;
46.5;?;Johnson to Broad, no run round the wicket, goes for the leg stump yorker - clever stuff - and it's not far from the timber as it shoots past Broad's pads;
46.4;1;Johnson to Tremlett, 1 run finds the edge, it was short of a length, thick edge but short of third slip and it escapes towards third man;

46.2;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run a rare full delivery, yorker on off stump, dug out to the off side;

44.6;?;Johnson to Broad, no run does well this time, gets behind the line and defends to the off side;
44.5;?;Johnson to Broad, no run he's taken a blow! Fierce delivery. Takes him on the back of the helmet, although the ball brushed the wrist first. This is hostile;
44.4;?;Johnson to Broad, no run 90mph/144kph, he's right across outside off, again, to a ball pitching in Johnson's half and aims another flick, but the delivery flies to Haddin;
44.3;2;Johnson to Broad, 2 runs pushed across outside off, Broad drives from the back foot through the huge gap at cover...punchy stroke, but the two batsmen nearly run into each other;
44.2;4;Johnson to Broad, FOUR runs short again, outside leg stump, makes connection this time and flicks it about where leg slip would have been;
44.1;?;Johnson to Broad, no run jumps across his crease, it's a short ball outside leg, he flicks at it but doesn't make contact...Broad finished outside off stump;
43.6;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run left alone outside off;
43.5;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run another one flying past the outside edge;
43.4;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run stands and plays this with the bat, falls in front of short leg off the face;
43.3;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run fuller and outside off, left alone;
43.2;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run stays round the wicket, Tremlett gets taken on the glove as he fends at a short ball in front of his face;
43.1;1;Harris to Broad, 1 run more short stuff, from round the wicket, Broad is far from convincing as he flaps and it, the ball flies wide of short leg;
42.6;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run short of a length, Tremlett not completely in line as it fizzes past the outside edge. Wonderful stuff from Johnson. A epic spell;
42.5;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run that's short and quick, clears Tremlett's head by a long way which is quite some effort;
42.4;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run banged in at the body, Tremlett stands tall (or just stands) as he defends down in front of short leg;
42.3;4;Johnson to Tremlett, FOUR runs awkward again, short and Tremlett fends it away down the leg side off the glove...not far from Haddin;
42.2;1;Johnson to Broad, 1 run short on the hip, flicked down to long leg;
42.1;?;Johnson to Broad, no run round the wicket, well-directed bouncer over off stump and Broad has to be sharp to get his gloves out of the way;
41.6;?;Lyon to Tremlett, no run tossed up, goes back and defends in front of off stump - and that, incredibly, brings us to tea, with England clinging on by a thread;
41.5;?;Lyon to Tremlett, no run flighted, straightening on the stumps, Tremlett gets a leading edge short on the off side;
41.4;1;Lyon to Broad, 1 run gives this some air, leans out and punches another single through mid-off;

41.1;1;Lyon to Broad, 1 run Broad forces the ball into a gap on the off side and scampers a single;

40.5;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run fired across again, slightly back of a length, Tremlett shoulders arms again;
40.4;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run full and wide of the stumps, leaves this well alone;
40.3;W;Johnson to Swann, OUT gone! Amazing, incredible scenes at the Gabba, England eight down! This is becoming a collapse for the ages, Swann the latest to be swallowed up, Johnson again the tormentor. He was hanging back for the short ball, this was on a length, on leg stump, he wasn't forward and an inside edge ballooned off the pad to short leg;Graeme Swann c Bailey b Johnson 0 (7m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
40.2;?;Johnson to Swann, no run banged in, down the leg side, this time he ducks;

38.6;?;Johnson to Swann, no run length ball, leaping at 91mph/145kph outside off, Swann drops his hands in the nick of time;
38.5;?;Johnson to Swann, no run thumped hard into the deck, Swann dips his head out of the way of a bumper;
38.4;W;Johnson to Root, OUT full and wide, Root drives, huge edge and another one falls! England are in tatters, seven down, all their batsmen back in the coop! What was Root doing there?! It was pitched up, leaving him and he threw the bat, a loose drive, steering the ball into the midriff of third slip, Smith again. Australia in excelsis!;Joe Root c Smith b Johnson 2 (14m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57;

37.5;?;Lyon to Broad, no run this is better, floated up on the stumps, Broad drops the bat on it solidly;
37.4;?;Lyon to Broad, no run tossed up, very wide off the stumps and Broad gratefully watches it spin and spit further away from him;
37.3;W;Lyon to Prior, OUT and is that another? Prior lobs the ball to short leg - or does he? Smith took it again at short leg, throwing himself to his right, but Dar wasn't convinced. Australia review after a brief discussion and it looks like a brilliant decision, as replays show the ball coming off the inside edge on to pad. Superb catch from Smith... and Dar raises the finger! Another golden duck for Prior at the Gabba - and we know what happened last time;Matt Prior c Smith b Lyon 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
37.2;W;Lyon to Bell, OUT spin and bounce, is there a little bit of glove as it pops to short leg? Yes, there is! Bell is gone, Lyon roars in delight, this trampolined off the surface as the batsman went back, the ball hit thigh pad and just a tickle of bat/glove, straight into the hands of the close catcher! The Gabba's grisly magic is working after all;Ian Bell c Smith b Lyon 5 (29m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 31.25;
37.1;?;Lyon to Bell, no run full and flighred, gets forward to defend;
36.6;?;Johnson to Root, no run touch wider, gets forward and leaves;
36.5;?;Johnson to Root, no run pitched up again, angled across, Root opens the face and pokes the ball to point;
36.4;?;Johnson to Root, no run the field was set for another short ball, Johnson going back over the wicket, but it was instead full, Root dropped the bat and was only a whisker from getting something on it, sound of bat on ground, I think;
36.3;W;Johnson to Carberry, OUT short, speared across and takes the edge, he's gone, Johnson does it again! Superbly planned and executed by Australia, Carberry was clearly discomfited by that line of attack, Johnson beating out a tattoo of short deliveries that rose towards the ribcage, this slid across and although he tried to withdraw the bat, it clipped a chunk and flew to slip;Michael Carberry c Watson b Johnson 40 (165m 113b 4x4 0x6) SR: 35.39;
36.2;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run another bumper, this time Carberry takes it on ... but hooks and misses at a sharply rising ball;
36.1;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run thudded in short and the ball deflects away, behind short leg, who scrambles in pursuit - looks like it careened into Carberry's ribs, rather than took the glove;
35.6;?;Lyon to Bell, no run floated up around off stump, Bell gets in line to tap back down the track;
35.5;?;Lyon to Bell, no run comes forward and drives this time, towards mid-off;
35.4;?;Lyon to Bell, no run tossed up around off, defended on the front foot;
35.3;2;Lyon to Bell, 2 runs pushed flatter and a little wide, Bell is quick to go back this time and chop a couple in front of point;
35.2;?;Lyon to Bell, no run tossed up a little higher, Bell comes a long way forward to intercept the danger;
35.1;?;Lyon to Bell, no run round the wicket from Lyon, drifting across and defended into the on side;
34.6;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run gets forward outside off and watches another one through;
34.5;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run pitched up, well outside off, this is up above 90mph again but left alone;
34.4;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run lovely ball from Johnson, full and swerving late past the outside edge, Carberry drew his bat inside but he'd already been beaten;
34.3;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run fullish, wide of the stumps and ignored by the batsman;
34.2;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run pushed across, looking to induce a moment's indecision - and indiscretion - outside off, but Bell dabs the ball daintily into the covers and steals a base;
34.1;?;Johnson to Bell, no run length ball slanted across the right-hander from over the wicket, Bell raises his bat to the sky;
33.6;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run length ball, straightening and bouncing, drops back and punches into the covers but again there's no run - three maidens in a row for Lyon, just the sort of control his captain wants;
33.5;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run Carberry is on the front foot to push defensively towards silly point again;
33.4;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run floated up in the channel, again Carberry gets his bat in line to block;
33.3;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run attempts some aggression to Lyon, who has dictated terms to far, but a back-foot force can't beat extra cover;
33.2;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run this comes off the outer half of the bat as Carberry prods at it, running low past silly point;
33.1;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run tossed up on an off-stump line, defended into the off side;
32.6;?;Harris to Bell, no run gets behind the line and defends, with head bowed, back down the track;
32.5;2;Harris to Bell, 2 runs flicked off the pads and in the air again, albeit briefly, the ball skittering past midwicket and away for Bell's first runs;
32.4;?;Harris to Bell, no run shoulders arms, the ball again zipping through;
32.3;?;Harris to Bell, no run continues to deliver a testing line outside the off peg, Bell watchful but offers no stroke;

26.4;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run back of a length, dangling it outside the stumps and Carberry happy to let it by;

21.2;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run flung outside off stump, left alone;

20.6;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run wide outside off, another maiden for Siddle;
20.5;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run terrific delivery, a yorker, Carberry manages to jab down to keep it out...for a moment Clarke ponders a review thinking it was pad first;

5.4;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run woof, that's some MJ magic right there, signs of that mercurial swing as the ball curves late away from the batsman, who wasn't forward and poked in vain - not far off getting a snick on it;

Ryan Harris with the first over. So we have to wait for Mitchell...
The Australians coming back out. Cook and Carberry will follow shortly. Huge moment for Carberry, his second, belated chance at Test cricket. This should be a testing period up to lunch.
Irfan: "Haddin played 24 deliveries in last 10 overs . Means tailender face 36 deliveries. That's not the way you play with lower order. He should take most of the strike just as Rohit done against WI"
Dean: "Credit where it is due, even when approaching a 100 our batsmen will still find a way to get themselves out!" Perhaps a tad harsh...
 Innings Start
And that's it, Michael Clarke comes out or dressing room and signals the declaration. He has set England 561, there are just under 200 overs left in the match. The final hour today should be torrid for England's batsmen

52.1;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run full and drifting to leg, flicked round the corner;

51.5;1;Root to Clarke, 1 run full, pushed across and tapped down the ground to long-off;
51.4;3;Root to Warner, 3 runs tossed up outside off, driven into the ground and over short extra cover - that will do it, a first Ashes ton for Warner, his fourth in Tests, and richly deserved;
51.3;?;Root to Warner, no run this slips on the with arm, clips the inside edge of the bat before deflecting into the front pad;
51.2;?;Root to Warner, no run short and there to be pulled away but Warner paddles the ball straight along the ground to backward square;

50.6;?;Anderson to Warner, no run good length, off-stump line, tries to play to leg and the ball rolls down the track;
50.5;?;Anderson to Warner, no run oof, this goes past the outside edge, Anderson is possibly getting a little bit of reverse out of the old ball, it just straightens a fraction to beat the bat as Warner poked from the crease;
50.4;?;Anderson to Warner, no run pitched up, tailing in towards middle and leg, worked to the leg side, no run there;
50.3;4;Anderson to Warner, FOUR runs edged but wide of slip! Anderson got a little extra bounce from a length ball outside off, Warner actually dropped the hands quite well and it would probably have fallen short of a catcher, had there been one in;

49.1;?;Root to Clarke, no run tossed up on the stumps and clipped to midwicket;
48.6;4;Anderson to Warner, FOUR runs round the wicket, pitched up outside off and Warner narrows the gap a bit further, hitting the ball out of his slot and over mid-off, a meaty lofted drive that takes him with one blow of a century;

47.4;1;Root to Clarke, 1 run tossed up, Clarke is on the move again, takes one into the leg side;
47.3;?;Root to Clarke, no run on the stumps, fires this back to the bowler, who fields;
47.2;?;Root to Clarke, no run stays in the crease and defends this time;
47.1;4;Root to Clarke, FOUR runs here comes the charge, Clarke leaves the crease and bunts the ball over mid-off, that sails towards the rope - no more grinding, out come the cleavers;
46.6;?;Swann to Warner, no run fired in a bit quicker, jabbed into the off side from the crease;
46.5;3;Swann to Clarke, 3 runs the crowd roars approval again, as Clarke works Swann into another gap square on the leg side;
46.4;3;Swann to Warner, 3 runs more positivity from Warner, this time opening up his body and swiping the ball through backward square;

46.2;?;Swann to Warner, no run tossed up, comes forward and defends safely into the ground;
46.1;?;Swann to Warner, no run angled in towards middle and off, blocked;
45.6;2;Root to Clarke, 2 runs opens up the off side this time, pushed a little wide and driven square;
45.5;4;Root to Clarke, FOUR runs flat and swept hard, Clarke quickly getting down low to the ground and flat-batting the ball through deep square leg for a boundary;
45.4;?;Root to Clarke, no run on the stumps, prodded towards mid-on;

44.6;?;Swann to Warner, no run comes off the pad and loops to slip, England ponder another review but decide against it;
44.5;?;Swann to Warner, no run big appeal for lbw. Was it pad first? Cook calls for a review. May be outside the line, too. DRS, here we go. Actually, it's come off the face of the bat, the the bat clipped the back leg. Simple one for the third umpire.;
44.4;?;Swann to Warner, no run driven to short cover;
44.3;?;Swann to Warner, no run starts to press forward, then rocks back to defend a slightly shorter delivery;
44.2;?;Swann to Warner, no run drifting into leg stump, takes the pad into the on side;

43.5;?;Root to Warner, no run pushed into the off side, Clarke screams 'no';
43.4;?;Root to Warner, no run jeepers, that's a beauty! Turn and bounce from outside off, beats Warner's outside edge. First one either spinner has got to go today;
43.3;?;Root to Warner, no run on middle, defended;
43.2;?;Root to Warner, no run driven to short cover;
43.1;4;Root to Warner, FOUR runs round the wicket, Warner down the pitch and driving handsomely again...Swann chases hard through the covers, but this is a rare occasion of the ball running away over the oufield. Hits the rope just before Swann can flick it back;
42.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run close! Goes down for the slog sweep and gets a thick bottom edge that cannons into his boot and loops into the leg side. Bell, at short leg, was ducking and it didn't carry to midwicket;

42.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run defended to the on side;
42.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run clipped to midwicket;

 Innings Start
6.05pm: This match has provided a banquet of talking points, a smorgasboard of Ashes chatter that should provide us with plenty to chew through before the second Test, which begins in Adelaide on December 4. Why not start yourself off with David Hopps' report as an amuse-bouche, then ready yourself for reaction, opinion and analysis on the site throughout the day. There might even be some fun to be had in our Ashes Banter Funhouse (just don't go tweeting Swanny). From Gnasher and myself, it's so long, farewell - let's do it all again in a couple of weeks. This series could be a ripper. Ta ra
5.55pm: Mark Nicholas is handling the post-match interviews...
England captain Alastair Cook: "It's been a tough couple of days for us. We got ourselves intro a really good position, credit to how Haddin and Johnson played but we thought we had done well. Got off to a poor start with the bat and it ran away from us. Australia put us under pressure. Johnson bowled well, that's something we need to work on ahead of Adelaide. We've played him well in the past and that's something we'll have to look to do in the next game. When you only bat for 50 overs, the bowlers need time to rest in these conditions; we didn't do that and they suffered a bit. It's going to hurt us but there are plenty of characters in this side and we are going to fight back."
Australia's Michael Clarke is greeted by rapturous applause from the stands: "Fantastic start, there were some fantastic individual perfofmances, Mitchell Johnson in particular. The Brisbane crowd have been great, all the boys are grateful and I really hope this bodes well for the summer. England will come back, it's only one Test but I'm really pleased. We didn't start too well with the bat but credit to the boys for coming back. England have shown they are a quality team and we have to do it again in the next match."
Mitchell Johnson was Man of the Match, I think, though Channel 9 cut off their broadcast.
5.45pm: Australia have wrapped up a crushing defeat, despite the rain, despite their shaky start on Thursday, despite a run of seven defeats in nine Tests. This has been a hugely impressive display and looks to have posted a significant marker for the series; England have been battered and bruised in body and mind, suffering the sixth-heaviest defeat, in terms of runs, in their history. Australia's fortress remains intact, Alastair Cook's men the latest to be chewed up in the Gabbatoir, and the Ashes have been ignited. Australia have won only their second Test in 2013 and in doing so, inflicted England's first defeat in 14 Tests - that last occasion, in Ahmedabad 12 months ago, led to a history-making revival but they look to have an even more ferocious challenge on their hands this time. Mitchell Johnson, with nine wickets and 103 runs in the match, has been resurrected in almost as spectacular fashion as Australia's fortunes compared to six months ago... Adelaide, dear reader, can't come soon enough.
81.1;W;Johnson to Anderson, OUT Anderson fends at another brute of a ball from Johnson, it goes straight up in the air and it is the bowler, fittingly, who jogs underneath to complete the dismissal and ensure that Australia win the match by 381 runs, giving them a 1-0 lead in the series;James Anderson c & b Johnson 2 (21m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
80.6;?;Harris to Root, no run goes for the stay-right-where-you-are bouncer, Root ducks obligingly;
80.5;4;Harris to Root, FOUR runs full and straight and clipped smartly in front of square for a boundary - that, ladies and gentlemen, takes England below the margin of defeat on this ground 11 years ago;
80.4;?;Harris to Root, no run good length, outside off, comes forward to defend;
80.3;?;Harris to Root, no run gets on the front foot, bat next to pad and opens the face, squirts the ball through gully but declines the run;
80.2;?;Harris to Root, no run straighter line, Root squares up in defence;
80.1;?;Harris to Root, no run length ball around the line of off stump, gets in line and defends with a straight bat;
79.6;2;Johnson to Anderson, 2 runs good length, on the stumps, solid connection this time from Anderson, who punches a couple through mid-on;
79.5;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run goes over the wicket now, length ball that fizzes through as Anderson swings hard and misses;
79.4;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run back-of-a-length, at the body and jabbed safely down into the leg side;
79.3;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run dug in again, Anderson can smell burning leather as another bumper rears past his nose;
79.2;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run that's an absolute ripsnorter of a bouncer, ripe to banjax better batsmen than Jimmy, who does well not to get a glove on it;
79.1;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run short and at the body, 90mph bumper that Anderson manages to jerk off his hips, to short backward square leg;
78.6;?;Harris to Root, no run Root duly leaves again, another good length ball in the channel;
78.5;?;Harris to Root, no run this is even wider, Root's not going to play at that but Australia probably aren't too fussed as long as he stays at that end;
78.4;?;Harris to Root, no run Harris thunders through, line and length outside off, another textbook leave;
78.3;?;Harris to Root, no run keeps plugging away on a good length outside off, nothing doing;
78.2;?;Harris to Root, no run fullish length in corridor outside off, left alone;
78.1;?;Harris to Root, no run;
77.6;1;Lyon to Root, 1 run Root nurdles the ball to backward square, straight to Warner and takes on the arm, reckless but who cares at this stage. The throw is good, Lyon breaks the stumps and that's it... or is it? Maybe not, because it appears Lyon might have broken the bails just before catching the ball. His elbow disturbed middle stump and, after a wee deliberation, third umpire Marais Erasmus decides it should be not out. So Root, who would have been run out by yards and was about halfway to the pavilion, keeps the strike after all;
77.5;?;Lyon to Root, no run comes forward, prods back towards the bowler;
77.4;?;Lyon to Root, no run pushed across outside off stump, drops back and attemps to cut, the ball thudding into Haddin's gloves;

76.5;W;Harris to Tremlett, OUT got him this time, the ball thudding into the splice before dropping into Bailey's outstretched hand at short leg! After a short working over, Tremlett departs, deserved reward for Harris. One bouncer too many for the hulking Tremlett, he wasn't getting out of the way this time and Australia are on the brink;Chris Tremlett c Bailey b Harris 7 (47m 41b 1x4 0x6) SR: 17.07;
76.4;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run edged this time, healthy connection but it falls just short of Haddin, diving in front of first slip;
76.3;4;Harris to Tremlett, FOUR runs dug in, flying towards the slip and helped over them and to the rope, Tremlett ramping the ball to good effect;
76.2;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run thumped on the pad in front of leg stump but Harris stifles his appeal, realising that it pitched outside the line;
76.1;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run goes round the wicket, going to try and cramp Tremlett, make him get in the way of one, this is short again but misses the target;
75.6;?;Johnson to Root, no run pounds in and hits the deck hard, Root stays back and blocks the ball safely down on to the pitch;
75.5;?;Johnson to Root, no run quick, around 88mph/141kph, in the corridor outside off, lets this one through;
75.4;?;Johnson to Root, no run pitched up in the channel outside off, Root blocks this into the covers;
75.3;?;Johnson to Root, no run goes back over the wicket, full and angled across, no shot offered;
75.2;?;Johnson to Root, no run short again, this time Root weaves out of the way like a bantamweight;
75.1;?;Johnson to Root, no run more rib-bothering short stuff from Johnson, worked away through backward square, this time Root decides to protect the No. 10;
74.6;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run short of a length but wide of the stumps and Tremlett gives it a robot stare, offers no stroke;
74.5;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run that's a beaut, on a length and kicking like Buckeroo, so close to flicking the gloves as Tremlett drops his hands;
74.4;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run shuffles across and defends with a straight bat;
74.3;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run Harris continues to hit mid-pitch, this time the batsman levers his giant frame into a hedgehog curl to get out of the way;
74.2;2;Harris to Tremlett, 2 runs dug in at the body, Tremlett fends the ball way past short leg off the inside edge, picks up a couple;
74.1;?;Harris to Tremlett, no run short of a length and sliding down the leg side;
73.6;?;Johnson to Root, no run on the stumps, good pace and bounce but well defended again;
73.5;?;Johnson to Root, no run slung in very short and fast and well down the leg side this time;
73.4;?;Johnson to Root, no run Johnson charges in and slams the ball short, this rises like steam off a kettle and Root lets it through;
73.3;?;Johnson to Root, no run on a length, aimed at off stump, gets in line to defend;
73.2;?;Johnson to Root, no run short and over the top of off stump, again Root hangs back to defend;
73.1;?;Johnson to Root, no run round the wicket, angled in short of a length and blocked on the back foot;
72.6;?;Lyon to Tremlett, no run very full, on the stumps, tapped back down the track;
72.5;?;Lyon to Tremlett, no run full, drifting to leg, spinning past the batsman's legs into Haddin's gloves;
72.4;?;Lyon to Tremlett, no run tossed up outside off, goes back and it comes off the outside half of the bat, low towards slip;
72.3;?;Lyon to Tremlett, no run leans out to defend;
72.2;?;Lyon to Tremlett, no run goes over the wicket, spinning in and defended in front of the wicket;
72.1;1;Lyon to Root, 1 run tossed up on the stumps, worked though midwicket for one, which the batsmen decide to take... I sippose Root couldn't keep the strike for the next 100 overs;
71.6;1;Harris to Root, 1 run plays off the back foot again, edged low towards the slips and it bounces, runs away for a single to give Root the strike;
71.5;?;Harris to Root, no run tight line, Root stays back and defends a length ball in front of off stump;
71.4;?;Harris to Root, no run pitched up around off stump, blocked into the off side;
71.3;4;Harris to Root, FOUR runs Harris goes full again, straighter line and carefully placed back down the ground, nicely timed on-drive brings Root four;
71.2;?;Harris to Root, no run fullish and quite wide of the stumps, Root diligently steps out and leaves;
71.1;?;Harris to Root, no run full outside off, left alone;
70.6;?;Smith to Tremlett, no run nicely tossed up, gets a good stride forward and blocks;

65.2;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run fuller and defended to cover;
65.1;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run fended in the air to slip...but off the arm guard by the looks of it. Clarke reviews. It was another snarling short ball, Tremlett turned his head, and the ball did indeed come off the arm. One of the quickest DRS confirmations you'll see. Move on.;

63.6;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run he ducks under another short one;
63.5;?;Johnson to Tremlett, no run short of a length and rising past the outside edge;
63.4;W;Johnson to Swann, OUT and another! This is a procession. Dare I say, weak? It's pushed across outside off, Swann chases it and gets a thick edge to third slip where it's well taken diving to his right by Smith;Graeme Swann c Smith b Johnson 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
63.3;?;Johnson to Swann, no run over the wicket, full on leg stump, takes the pad;
63.2;W;Johnson to Broad, OUT done it! That didn't take long. It was 91mph/146kph, short down the leg side, Broad, jumping across his crease, fences at it and gets a glove down the leg side. The Australians go wild.;Stuart Broad c ?Haddin b Johnson 4 (3m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33;
63.1;1;Johnson to Root, 1 run full and wide, driven to deep cover;
62.6;4;Lyon to Broad, FOUR runs he decides to counter attack, tossed up outside off and Broad plants him straight down the ground;
62.5;?;Lyon to Broad, no run gets forward to his first ball and defends;
62.4;W;Lyon to Prior, OUT would you believe! He's picked out leg slip. That's very lazy from Prior. The line was outside leg stump, he could have kicked or left it, and he turned it straight off the face of the bat to leg slip;Matt Prior c Warner b Lyon 4 (8m 8b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50;
62.3;?;Lyon to Prior, no run turns and skids into the pads, strangled shout for lbw;

61.5;?;Johnson to Root, no run pitches up and defended to the on side;
61.4;?;Johnson to Root, no run a bouncer over leg stump, 91mph/146kph, and comfortably avoided...Johnson is saying enough out there to fill a book;
61.3;?;Johnson to Root, no run short of a length and left alone;
61.2;?;Johnson to Root, no run full outside off, left alone, trying to draw him into the drive as they did in the first innings;
61.1;?;Johnson to Root, no run touch of extra bounce, he rides it and defends in front of short leg;
60.6;?;Lyon to Prior, no run comes forward and works to the on side...lovely over from Lyon;
60.5;?;Lyon to Prior, no run goes back and turns it towards short leg, similar to the shot that brought his downfall in the first innings;
60.4;4;Lyon to Prior, FOUR runs and now he's off the mark, he cuts and it was in the air through short third man but not near any fielder;
60.3;?;Lyon to Prior, no run he avoids it, clips a full ball to midwicket;
60.2;W;Lyon to Cook, OUT got him! That's the big one. Extra bounce, draws Cook into another cut stroke and this time it takes the top edge. Perhaps a little tight to him for the stroke, but the bounce was the key.;Alastair Cook c ?Haddin b Lyon 65 (226m 195b 3x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
60.1;?;Lyon to Cook, no run round the wicket, slides onto Cook who cuts to backward point;
59.6;?;Johnson to Root, no run on middle and leg, defended back to the bowler who then gets right up close to Root - perhaps deciding where to have dinner tonight;
59.5;?;Johnson to Root, no run sprayed very wide, 86mph/138kph, but the umpire lets him get away with it;
59.4;?;Johnson to Root, no run fuller, a touch further outside off, left alone;
