Australia have done well to bring up a strong total here, 304. It was led by a well-controlled opening stand between Aaron Finch and Phil Hughes, and then there were excellent but contrasting contributions in the middle order by George Bailey and Glen Maxwell. On a pitch that is slow, Australia would be very happy with what they have achieved here. Yuvraj Singh conspired to slow the Australians down with a couple of wickets in the middle and a run-out as well, but India's main bowlers struggled to put the check on scoring. Back in 45 minutes
Vikrant Kakde: "Impressive over rate by India. Gone are the days when Dhoni was used to being charged with slow over rate."
Rohit Verma: "With these types of flat batting wickets, I am sorry to say that there will be odd good bowling spells here and there but I do not think India will ever have a good bowling attack. And onus is on the Indian Cricketing management for what they are providing to play on!"
Ekant: "I don't understand Dhoni's tactics at times. BK was by far the best Indian pacer today and he ends up bowling only 7 overs. Waste of resource which is already very scarce in Indian context."

49.5;6;Sharma to McKay, SIX runs slower delivery on a length, asking to be hit, McKay swings and gets it right of the meat, sends it soaring in the Pune sky to the stands at deep midwicket;
49.4;4;Sharma to McKay, FOUR runs back of length delivery outside off, McKay likes it, he flat-bats it to wide long-on boundary with utmost ease. The mid-on was in, and he is being sent back now;
49.3;?;Sharma to McKay, no run he drives the length delivery slightly in the air, straight to point;
49.2;W;Sharma to Faulkner, OUT Ishant gives a stare to the batsman! It was another wide and full delivery, and unlike the previous delivery, Faulkner gets a whole lot of bat in this one, times this one perfectly, but just hits it at catchable hight at Vinay Kumar at extra cover. The fielder times his jump and plucks it;James Faulkner c Vinay Kumar b Sharma 27 (28m 22b 0x4 2x6) SR: 122.72;

45.6;4;Vinay to Bailey, FOUR runs smart pull shot again! It was short of length outside off, instead of pulling it along the ground like he was doing earlier, Bailey chooses to go straighter and in the air, he finds the gap at wide long-on and it just drops short of the boundary;
45.5;1;Vinay to Faulkner, 1 run he stays in the crease and clips the back of length delivery to deep backward square leg;
45.4;1;Vinay to Bailey, 1 run length delivery on off, the batsman dabs it towards mid-on and takes the first easily, but then he thinks about a second. Vinay, in the meantime, had run to the ball and fires a throw at the non-striker's. Had that hit, it was curtains for Bailey, but he survives;

47.2;2;Vinay to Faulkner, 2 runs length delivery on off, the batsman gives it mighty swing and it goes way up in the air towards deep midwicket, between the two worst fielders - Ishant and Ashwin - and it lands safely between them. It should have been Ishant's;
47.1;1;Vinay to Johnson, 1 run angled in to the batsman, who tucks it to midwicket for a single;

46.3;W;Ashwin to Bailey, OUT and he holes out at deep midwicket! The shot was on though, it was a tossed up delivery on off and Bailey aimed for the stands at deep midwicket, he just doesn't get as much as he would have liked behind that and the fielder takes a simple catch right on the edge of the boundary;George Bailey c Raina b Ashwin 85 (89m 82b 10x4 0x6) SR: 103.65;
46.2;4;Ashwin to Bailey, FOUR runs he makes room my moving outside leg and thuds this through extra cover, once it beats the man at extra cover, it picks up speed;

42.2;W;Ashwin to Haddin, OUT this one is plumb, Haddin was deep in his crease and tried to flick this flatter delivery towards the leg side, but it was pushed a bit quicker too and Haddin was beaten to be hit right in front of the middle stump. That would have gone on to hit the top of the middle;Brad Haddin lbw b Ashwin 10 (13m 14b 2x4 0x6) SR: 71.42;

However, once he gets past the crease, he curls into the fetus position, as he seems to be in some pain. But as I glance over he is walking back to the dressing room as the third umpire confirms it is out. A huge cheer rings from the Pune crowd;Adam Voges run out (Yuvraj Singh) 7 (15m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 53.84;

 Innings Start
Well there you have it. Australia go 1-0 up in the series, against most of the expert's predictions, and India now have their work cut out as they need to keep Australia from winning the series 6-1 in order to protect their number one ODI ranking. Bailey will be especially pleased with how his players, both batsmen and bowlers, fared today, and it should give them confidence into the rest of the series. Thank you so much for choosing ESPNcricinfo to get the latest news and up-to-the-minute ball-by-ball coverage of this first ODI between India and Australia. On behalf of the scorers, this is Rohan Sharma saying good night, and good luck!
George Bailey, Australia captain and Man of the Match: It was a fantastic all-round performance. We spoke about that before the game. We had to do that right through the series, and get contributions regularly, if we wanted to beat India in this series. There were a couple of times India got on top, but to our bowlers credit, our bowlers found a way to fight back. Johnson has been really impressive over the last couple of months, and was impressive in England too. He definitely gave us a great start. Yeah, putting on 300 was really good and we had contributions right down the order. The 100-run stand set a great platform, and Maxwell provided great impetus in the middle, with Faulkner and the bowlers hitting well at the end. It was important to have even contributions through the order. We were looking at 300 from the start so it was important we started well. But it is going to be a bit of a war of attrition this series, so now on to the next one.
MS Dhoni, India captain: The way we started we weren't able to build partnerships. We should have got closer. Was disappointed with the shot selection today. Once you are set its important to carry on. That's what we talk about in this game. If you look at the wicket, with the time we started, it was definitely going to swing a bit, but we struggled a bit. We don't have genuine fast bowlers, more swing bowlers, so we couldn't generate the bounce that the other bowlers (Australia) did. The spinners did well, but when we finished off [the innings] we gave too much away. We had to hit the deck from the start. If you can dig it in, you get extra bounce. Spinners did well, but we have to consider the dew factor. We were in a decent position, and at one point the game was 50/50. it was important that the batsman carried on till the Powerplay. We have got the power the achieve that, but we played shots that were not really intended. That harmed us. It is important that when we chase we have to make solid partnerships. I think the most important period in a chase is between the 25th and 35th over, as you can't lose any wickets then.
We will have the match presentation in just a few minutes..
James Faulkner: It was a good team effort. We know it was tough going against them. McKay bowled exceptionally well. Mitch (Mitchell) has been bowling well for the past 6 months. He has been bowling fast and swinging the ball. I think on this wicket here I was trying to keep it really simple. I think we did well as a team to restrict them to 230. There was a little more grass here than what we have seen from T20 cricket, but as I said, it was a good team performance. I think India showed their class the other night when they chased over 200. We put up 300 today, so we did our job. We expect a good remaining six matches to come as well.
Australia 1, India 0. The bowlers have backed up a wonderful display of batting which began with Aaron Finch and Philip Hughes putting on an instrumental 110 run stand, before George Bailey came into the fray and scored 85 off 81, with some helpful cameos from Maxwell and Faulkner, to get Australia to 304. Even with a star-studded batting line-up, India were put to the sword by an excellent opening spell from Mitchell Johnson and Clint McKay, and, apart from a period when Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli were cruising, Australia looked resigned to a certain defeat. But the go-slow approach backfired in a huge way, and India paid the price. So Australia win this by 72 runs, and go 1-0 up in the series.
