1.45pm So, that's the end of that. Australia will need 362 to square the series, thanks to an imposing allround batting effort, led by the captain, Faf du Plessis, with Rilee Rossouw and JP Duminy in fine form as well. Back shortly for the chase
49.6;?;Tremain to Parnell, no run slower ball, well disguised, through to the keeper;
49.5;1;Tremain to Phehlukwayo, 1 run short and wide, if he'd left it he'd have had another go at it, for sure. But instead he toe-ended it down to deep point;
49.4;?;Tremain to Phehlukwayo, no run another murderous wipe through the line, but connects with nothing but air! I have hit upon a new favourite tailend batsman...;
49.3;6;Tremain to Phehlukwayo, SIX runs he has absolutely battered this one! In the slot, and picks the slower ball as well. Timing, power, placement. Into the stands over the bowler's head!;
49.2;?;Tremain to Phehlukwayo, no run stunning followthrough, reminiscent of Darren Gough's backside-slapping strokeplay at Sydney in 1994-95, but no contact this time;
49.1;4;Tremain to Phehlukwayo, FOUR runs pounded down the ground for a three-bounce four through long-off! Cleared the front leg to batter a length delivery;
48.6;1;Hastings to Phehlukwayo, 1 run on the pads, worked square for another single. Lucky's first run for South Africa!;
48.5;1;Hastings to Parnell, 1 run outside off, tapped into the gap;
48.4;1;Hastings to Phehlukwayo, 1 run outside off, dabbed out to point;
48.3;?;Hastings to Phehlukwayo, no run banged in short, and an ambitious roundhouse swipe, no contact but plenty intent;
48.2;W;Hastings to Miller, OUT chopped hard out to point, and a tumbling stop ... in fact, it's a catch! Zampa reacted so calmly that no-one really noticed it was out. The umpires are taking a look, and lo and behold, the ball buried in his breadbasket! Time is called on Miller Time...;David Miller c Zampa b Hastings 26 (33m 17b 4x4 0x6) SR: 152.94;
48.1;4;Hastings to Miller, FOUR runs whoops, a low full-toss outside off, that's asking for trouble. Miller wallops it for a one-bounce four through wide long-on;
35.6;1;Marsh to du Plessis, 1 run works the gap to keep the strike;
35.5;1;Marsh to Duminy, 1 run nudged into the leg side;
35.4;?;Marsh to Duminy, no run outside off, dabbed into the covers, good response to that early-over flogging;

35.2;?;Marsh to Duminy, no run tighter line, patted into the covers;
35.1;4;Marsh to Duminy, FOUR runs no cutting that one off! Width outside off, and walloped high and handsome over the cover field. South Africa are putting the hammer down;
34.6;1;Zampa to Duminy, 1 run clobbered into the deep where Warner does well to gather and release in double-quick time;
34.5;4;Zampa to Duminy, FOUR runs outside off, gave himself room with a shimmy to leg, and freed the hands with a sweet flowing drive over the covers. Opened the face and gave it some humpty;
34.4;1;Zampa to du Plessis, 1 run patted to leg, and they take the single;
34.3;?;Zampa to du Plessis, no run nudged into the off side;
34.2;2;Zampa to du Plessis, 2 runs chipped over the top of the bowler, and bounces away down to long-off;
34.1;?;Zampa to du Plessis, no run solidly onto the front foot, back foot anchored in the event of spin;
47.6;1;Tremain to Miller, 1 run wide of off stump, clubbed out to deep extra cover;
47.5;1;Tremain to Parnell, 1 run onto the front foot, and punched down to long-off;
47.4;4;Tremain to Parnell, FOUR runs that's the one they've been waiting for! A full wind-up as Tremain drops short, and Parnell climbs across the line with a firm pull in front of square;
47.3;2;Tremain to Parnell, 2 runs slower ball bouncer, Parnell leans back to glide a cut down to third man, where the ball bobbles on the rough outfield but safely into the hands of the fielder;
47.2;1;Tremain to Miller, 1 run on the toes, flicked firmly to deep midwicket;
47.1;W;Tremain to Behardien, OUT heaved hard and violently out to deep midwicket! Tremain has his maiden ODI wicket, and it's come at a vital moment! Got right under the shot and gave Warner several decades to contemplate the ball as it fell back to earth. But he judged it just fine and South Africa's charge still hasn't quite materialised;Farhaan Behardien c Warner b Tremain 13 (17m 14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 92.85;
46.6;1;Hastings to Behardien, 1 run spanked in the air, but not enough distance or power. Just the single. Australia are brawling hard in these final overs;
46.5;2;Hastings to Behardien, 2 runs slower-ball bouncer, very wide, toe-ended out to cover with a waft of the bat;
46.4;?;Hastings to Behardien, no run driven hard again, but still South Africa's grandest intentions are kept under wraps;
46.3;1;Hastings to Miller, 1 run driven hard to long-off;
46.2;4;Hastings to Miller, FOUR runs that's the one! Miller finds his range with a fierce drill through the covers;
46.1;1;Hastings to Behardien, 1 run working the singles, but the big shots remain a touch elusive...;
33.6;4;Marsh to Duminy, FOUR runs too short, and the bounce is too true. Battered in front of square with a rifle-crack of willow;
33.5;1;Marsh to du Plessis, 1 run full and straight again, tapped to mid-on for another sharp single;
33.4;1;Marsh to Duminy, 1 run on the hip and dabbed round the corner;

33.2;1;Marsh to Duminy, 1 run round the wicket, banged in short, and hoicked into the leg side with a downward thump of the bat;
33.1;1;Marsh to du Plessis, 1 run outside off, nurdled backward of point;
32.6;1;Zampa to du Plessis, 1 run pushed through, nurdled to leg and they scamper one as the fielder homes in;
32.5;4;Zampa to du Plessis, FOUR runs gives it some air... and du Plessis gives it some tap, opening up the body and thrashing a drive through the covers, beats the fielder on the fence!;
32.4;1;Zampa to Duminy, 1 run very full, on the toes and thumped back low past the bowler's outstretched hand, just a single to long-on;

32.1;1;Zampa to Duminy, 1 run tossed up and poked back past the bowler to long-on;

31.5;?;Marsh to Duminy, no run pitched up, 128kph in the slot, doesn't quite catch the drive and sends it to backward point;
31.4;1;Marsh to du Plessis, 1 run good length in the channel, du Plessis opens the face to third man;
31.3;1;Marsh to Duminy, 1 run draws his length back a touch, comes across and dabs behind square;
31.2;4;Marsh to Duminy, FOUR runs full and now Duminy unleashes, skipping forwards and lofting over mid-off, clears the fielder and picks up four - that's the 50 stand between these two, a tidy partnership;
31.1;?;Marsh to Duminy, no run round the wicket, shortish outside off, lets it go;
30.6;?;Zampa to du Plessis, no run pushed through a bit quicker on off stump and du Plessis defends this time;

29.6;1;Head to Duminy, 1 run tossed up and clipped to leg for another single;
29.5;4;Head to Duminy, FOUR runs flighted, definitely some turn for Head this time, takes the outside edge as Duminy pushes at it, but he got enough on the ball to send it wide of Wade's gloves and running fine for four more;
29.4;1;Head to du Plessis, 1 run floated up on the stumps and worked through midwicket for a single;
29.4;5w;Head to du Plessis, 5 wide big turn... but unfortunately for Australia it has turned well down the leg side and run for extras. Maybe hit a crack?;
29.3;?;Head to du Plessis, no run quick and flat and pushed away into the covers;
29.2;1;Head to Duminy, 1 run tossed up and chipped over the off side, won't quite carry all the way to deep extra cover running in;
29.1;1;Head to du Plessis, 1 run lobbed up on middle and off, clumped through mid-off on the move;
28.6;2;Hastings to Duminy, 2 runs short at the body, paddled around the corner on the back foot, that'll be a couple to fine leg;

27.3;?;Head to du Plessis, no run darted in flatter on the stumps, gets a leading edge looking to turn to leg;
27.2;4;Head to du Plessis, FOUR runs full and floaty wide of the stumps, a gimme for the set batsman and he booms the half-volley through cover point for four;
27.1;2;Head to du Plessis, 2 runs dobbed on the pads, du Plessis flicks it through square, there's a man coming in off the boundary but they make it back for a second easily enough;

26.4;?;Hastings to Duminy, no run touch back of a length outside off, dropped into the covers and fielded quickly;
26.3;?;Hastings to Duminy, no run dug in, 130 kays, flying through above the ducking Duminy (not a euphemism);
26.2;?;Hastings to Duminy, no run comes across on off and blocks a length ball;
26.1;1;Hastings to du Plessis, 1 run stops in the pitch a fraction, through the drive early but it loops wide of Hastings in his follow through and runs to long-off;
25.6;1;Tremain to du Plessis, 1 run fullish and in the channel this time, reaches for the swipe and the ball flies aerially through backward point;
25.5;4;Tremain to du Plessis, FOUR runs goes for the yorker, not quite where he wanted it and du Plessis drills it back down the ground, beats two fielders to the long-on rope;
25.4;?;Tremain to du Plessis, no run zoinks, that did something! Only 128kph from Tremain but the seam was rotating and it leapt off a length, past the shoulder of the bat as du Plessis' eyes widened;

24.5;?;Hastings to Duminy, no run another short ball, outside off and JP gets into line this time;

24.3;?;Hastings to Duminy, no run round the wicket, good length on off and defended coming forwards;
24.2;1;Hastings to du Plessis, 1 run the batsmen crossed, Faf pushes into a gap at cover for one;
24.1;W;Hastings to Rossouw, OUT shortish and Rossouw pulls, sends it swirling into the Joburg atmosphere - taken at deep square leg! Not the most calculated of risks, looked like a long boundary out that direction and it was well short of carrying, Hastings again the bowler to strike. Looks like it was a cross-seamer that did for Rossouw... and a bit of a lucky take from Worrall, the sub fielder, as it went through the hands but landed in his lap;Rilee Rossouw c sub (DJ Worrall) b Hastings 75 (105m 81b 10x4 0x6) SR: 92.59;
23.6;4;Tremain to du Plessis, FOUR runs more tap for the new boys, a stiff-armed jab down the ground, du Plessis strolling out and crunching a straight drive through the line, Stevie Smith gives valiant chase and goes barreling into the rope but can't prevent a boundary;

23.1;?;Tremain to du Plessis, no run length ball, 138kph around off, turned to the leg side and they abort on the single;

21.6;2;Mennie to Rossouw, 2 runs on the body, nudged through the leg side and into a gap for two;
21.5;4;Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs woof, that's an umpire killer! Pitched up, 134kph and it disappears back a few clicks quicker, I'd wager, hammered through the line and Nigel Llong throws himself overboard as Mennie glances back to see the ball thump into the boards;
21.4;1;Mennie to du Plessis, 1 run slightly back of a length, stays on the back foot and punches to the cover sweeper;
21.3;?;Mennie to du Plessis, no run back over the wicket, dug in short, turned to leg but they think better of running;

20.6;1;Zampa to du Plessis, 1 run gets on to the front foot and pushes one into the covers to finish an expensive over;
20.5;?;Zampa to du Plessis, no run tossed up on middle and leg, worked back down the track;
20.4;4;Zampa to du Plessis, FOUR runs slightly short this time, again not a bad ball but du Plessis flashes a cut behind deep point, beats the man to the rope, four more!;
20.3;4;Zampa to du Plessis, FOUR runs touch too full from Zampa and du Plessis spanks him over extra cover, goes inside out again, really well timed because he wasn't quite to the pitch, powerful wristwork;
20.2;?;Zampa to du Plessis, no run gives it some air, du Plessis gets into line and taps away in front of square;
20.1;?;Zampa to du Plessis, no run floated up outside off, pushed into the covers on the front foot;

17.6;?;Marsh to Rossouw, no run pitched up, 126kph and punched into the covers;
17.5;?;Marsh to Rossouw, no run one the walk, tucks the ball down into the on side, Rossouw is looking for one but the ball goes straight to Marsh... who misfields it, with the stumps unguarded! Could have been a real chance, that. Not sure where Rossouw was going;
17.4;?;Marsh to Rossouw, no run full outside off, maybe a cross-seamer? Skips through a bit low as Rossouw flays unsuccessfully;

16.1;?;Zampa to Rossouw, no run tosses one up from over the wicket, Rossouw leans out and defends, like a dog sniffing a nettle;
15.6;4;Marsh to du Plessis, FOUR runs too full, but well played from du Plessis, bissecting the two men behind square with a whistling clip! Top shot;

11.4;?;Marsh to Rossouw, no run patted into the covers as Marsh finds some extra bounce;
11.3;1;Marsh to du Plessis, 1 run driven into the covers, du Plessis scampers the single into the covers, and wears the shy from Aaron Finch on his wrist as he makes his ground!

11.1;?;Marsh to Rossouw, no run tight defence on off stump;
10.6;W;Hastings to de Kock, OUT a big heave down the ground, it looks elegant enough, but he's not middled it at all! Right off the toe, a gentle back-pedal at mid-on, and Australia have the breakthrough!;Quinton de Kock c Tremain b Hastings 22 (44m 24b 2x4 0x6) SR: 91.66;
10.5;?;Hastings to de Kock, no run too much width but Warner at point is on hand to intercept a lashing cut. Lucky let-off;

8.4;?;Hastings to Rossouw, no run that's better, tighter line and length, and defended;

8.2;4;Hastings to Rossouw, FOUR runs that's impeccable. Just a fraction short, and slammed on the up through the covers once again. The timing is sensational;
8.1;?;Hastings to Rossouw, no run undercut out to point, the shot was on but the execution was lacking for a change;

7.1;1;Mennie to Rossouw, 1 run angled defence into the off side;
6.6;1;Tremain to Rossouw, 1 run fuller and drilled hard back down the track, where the non-striker's stumps act as a 12th fielder;
6.5;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run settling well into this over now, wider on the crease from round the wicket and defended to the off side;
6.4;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run high elbow action as Rossouw attempts to drive a full-length ball straight back past the bowler. Mid-on tidies up;
6.3;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run speared in towards the toes, defended from deep in the crease;
6.2;1;Tremain to de Kock, 1 run round the wicket, punched on the up to cover;
6.1;?;Tremain to de Kock, no run fully forward and well stopped in the followthrough;
5.6;?;Mennie to Rossouw, no run defended into the off side;
5.5;?;Mennie to Rossouw, no run forward and defended into the off side;
5.4;?;Mennie to Rossouw, no run this is turning into a good over, another tight and attacking delivery, good length and curling towards the off stump;
5.3;?;Mennie to Rossouw, no run full and probing, right in the blockhole;
5.2;?;Mennie to Rossouw, no run left well, almost a Test-match moment there. Line and length from the bowler, and respect from the batsman;
5.1;1;Mennie to de Kock, 1 run punched on the up through point;
4.6;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run another decent comeback but beats the edge to no avail;
4.5;4;Tremain to Rossouw, FOUR runs tremendous ball-striking, just a fraction too full and met with a lashing blade, hitting straight through the line, working against the inswing to pound it through the covers;
4.4;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run well bowled again, round the wicket and on that perfect length that is never quite there to drive or defend. Nips through the gate but past the stumps;
4.3;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run tighter to off stump and a bit of nibble off the pitch. Well bowled;
4.2;4;Tremain to Rossouw, FOUR runs power, placement and not even the pretence of a jog down the track, That was four from the moment it was flogged dismissively on the up through the covers;
4.1;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run tight line, lifting off the deck, defended to the off side;
3.6;2;Mennie to de Kock, 2 runs on the pads again, whipped hard through midwicket and an instant call of two. South Africa are cooking;
3.5;4;Mennie to de Kock, FOUR runs lovely strike, full face, pummelled down the ground;
3.4;?;Mennie to de Kock, no run forward to defend back down the track;
3.3;?;Mennie to de Kock, no run defended into the off side;
3.2;2;Mennie to de Kock, 2 runs poor delivery once again, curling into the pads which is never a good idea against de Kock. Fierce timing through the leg side but a fine diving stop to save the four;
3.1;?;Mennie to de Kock, no run onto the front foot, pushed to the off side;
2.6;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run on the back foot, drilled hard into the covers;
2.5;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run a crunching cut into the off side but can't pierce the infield this time;
2.4;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run round the wicket, and that's a fine delivery. Kicks off the turf and beats the outside edge;
2.3;2;Tremain to Rossouw, 2 runs hauled into the leg side, the pressure's on for the debutants;
2.2;2;Tremain to Rossouw, 2 runs better line and length, but that's some lovely timing through the covers, and the outfield is so quick it's as if the ball has been given an armed escort to the boundary as the fielder sprints to stay level with it;
2.1;4;Tremain to Rossouw, FOUR runs short and wide, I'm afraid that's rubbish in any format. Rossouw frees his hands and flings an uppercut four over backward point;
1.6;1;Mennie to Rossouw, 1 run calmly defended into the off-side, where a misfield gifts an extra single. Whoops. The outfield didn't help there, to be fair;
1.5;?;Mennie to Rossouw, no run lifting off a good length again, and defended with one hand;
1.4;4;Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs good riposte! A genuine lifter from a full, tight length. Takes a fat edge and eludes Smith, diving to his left at a solitary slip;
1.3;4;Mennie to Rossouw, FOUR runs spanked! That was an over-pitched outswinging half-volley, and Rossouw drills it with a big stride, an elegant knee-bend and a whoomph of bat;
1.2;1;Mennie to de Kock, 1 run on the pads, flicked hard to the sweeper behind square;
1.1;?;Mennie to de Kock, no run good delivery, shaping from leg to off on a good line and length. Defended;
0.6;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run up onto the toes, defended back down the pitch. Not a bad maiden over. But it's not a maiden over. If you see what I did there;
0.5;?;Tremain to Rossouw, no run forward and defended to mid-off;
0.4;2;Tremain to Rossouw, 2 runs the outfield is lightning quick as this one is punched from under the eyeline into the covers;
0.3;4;Tremain to Rossouw, FOUR runs lovely timing! Really not a lot wrong with that delivery, full, tight, a hint of swing back into the left-hander. But Rossouw's timing picks up where it left off at Centurion. Whistles through midwicket;
0.2;1;Tremain to de Kock, 1 run decent area once again as de Kock rocks back into the crease to flick his first single through the leg side;
0.1;?;Tremain to de Kock, no run decent pace, outside off, and squirted to point off a fat outside edge. Decent start;

10am Jo: "Well done to those two debutant bowlers. Yes many injuries but they look pretty handy themselves from what I've seen recently - tighter than Worrall I think. Glad to see Behrendorff back today too in Perth." Here's the first of them, it's Chris Tremain
9.55am So, here we go. Two debutants for Australia, no Hashim Amla for South Africa. What does the Wanderers have in store?
Kashi2052: "@Miller: Morning will love to see SA score 444-4 in 44.4 overs :P" That would satisfy most levels of OCD. Here come the batsmen.
9.48am Bastian: "Morning, Andrew. Since all the talk is about that match from a decade ago, what are your thoughts? Will SA walk over Australia again or is it going to be a tight one?" Well, South Africa are in the mood for runs, but there's a reason that that match was a once-in-a-decade showstopper. I'd be surprised if we get anything to rival that today. A tough precedent to have looming over Australia's two tyros though!
Waqas Ahmed: "What do you mean about Amla that 'He is fit again', then is he dropped?" South Africa see no reason to change a winning team for now. He'll be back soon enough, I'm sure.
9.30am Some team news before the toss. Australia have rung the changes and named two debutants in the same match, with Joe Mennie and Chris Tremain becoming ODI players No.215 and No.216. And talking of the toss, Steve Smith has won the toss and will bowl first.
For South Africa, there's still no Hashim Amla. He is fit again, according to the captain Faf du Plessis, but sits this one out after the success that his understudy, Rilee Rossouw, had at Centurion. An unchanged team for the home side.
South Africa 1 Quinton de Kock, 2 Rilee Rossouw, 3 Faf du Plessis, 4 JP Duminy, 5 David Miller, 6 Farhaan Behardien, 7 Andile Phehlukwayo, 8 Wayne Parnell, 9 Dale Steyn, 10 Kagiso Rabada, 11 Imran Tahir.
Australia 1 David Warner, 2 Aaron Finch, 3 Steven Smith (capt), 4 George Bailey, 5 Mitchell Marsh, 6 Travis Head, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 John Hastings, 9 Adam Zampa, 10 Chris Tremain, 11 Joe Mennie.
9.10am Good morning, and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's coverage of the second ODI between South Africa and Australia at Johannesburg. And how will the Aussies respond to their shellacking at Centurion on Friday? It hardly needs pointing out that ten years ago, on this very same ground, these same two teams produced 872 runs between them in arguably the most extraordinary ODI showdown of them all. And to judge by Quinton de Kock's mood during his brilliant 178 in the opening contest, he's in the mood to take advantage of the Wanderers true bounce and thin air. Expect fireworks. The toss is in 20 minutes, See you then.
 Innings Start
5.25pm: Thanks for your feedback, as ever. Dan's report is in the hutch and we're going to scarper. See you for more when the third ODI gets going on Wednesday. Toodles!
5.15pm: Presentations time, starting with Steven Smith: "We thought it was a bit over par but there have been some pretty high chases here. But when you're chasing 360 you need things to go pretty well from the start. We pulled it back nicely in their innings. Those middle overs we weren't able to contain Faf, JP played nicely as well. It didn't go according to plan, you need things to go right, no we're 2-0 down and need to win everything from here. Back against the wall, hopefully the characters will stand out and put in a performance."
South Africa captain Faf du Plessis is also Man of the Match: "I'd go almost as far as saying that was the perfect batting and bowling performance. We put big runs up and our bowlers were exceptional. Our quicks bowled exceptionally, they have two cracking openers and we didn't give them anything. There was a little bit of bounce, nice to bat when the ball got softer. If you offered me this two weeks ago, I wouldn't have believed you. We've played some really good cricket, we're going to keep doing the basics well and come back at Durban. [Your hundred?] The guys took the pressure off, the scoring rate was good and set up my innings nicely. Great to get a hundred, that's my job, so it's always nice to carry it through. I think there was something in it for the bowlers but our shot selection was really good today. I'll keep doing my best and hopefully the runs will continue."
5.05pm: Once again, no doubting who the better side was here. This is South Africa's second-biggest ODI win over Australia (batting first) and puts them 2-0 up in the series. Pretty textbook stuff, after being put in: Faf du Plessis scored a ton, other pitched in around him, then the bowlers took regular wickets. Australia, depleted attack and all, have some thinking to do.
37.4;W;Phehlukwayo to Zampa, OUT bowled 'im! Lucky breaks the stumps, quick and straight and Zampa played around it backing away, which means South Africa win by a whopping 142 runs with a dozen overs to spare;Adam Zampa b Phehlukwayo 8 (14m 11b 0x4 1x6) SR: 72.72;
37.3;6;Phehlukwayo to Zampa, SIX runs in the slot, out the park! Zampa gives Lucky the treatment with a fluid bosh over deep extra cover, that travelled;
37.2;?;Phehlukwayo to Zampa, no run pitched up and steered to backward point... did it carry? Not sure it did. Either way, he's not out;
37.1;?;Phehlukwayo to Zampa, no run shortish outside off, swing and a miss from Zampa;
36.6;?;Tahir to Tremain, no run here comes the googly, little bit short and Tremain has time to watch it on to the bat;

35.6;?;Phehlukwayo to Zampa, no run pitched up and sliced hard towards backward point... who hurls a throw in at the non-striker's end, though Tremain hadn't gone anywhere. Zampa can't be bothered with running on the ricochet;
35.5;W;Phehlukwayo to Hastings, OUT takes on the cutter, picks out deep midwicket! Hastings is off, a hasty swipe across the line, not as much pace on the ball for him to work with and it sails straight to the man on the fence, Australia nine down and all but done;John Hastings c Miller b Phehlukwayo 23 (25m 19b 1x4 2x6) SR: 121.05;
35.4;4;Phehlukwayo to Hastings, FOUR runs full and slogged, Hastings gets a hold of another one and biltongs four out between long-on and deep midwicket;
35.3;1;Phehlukwayo to Zampa, 1 run;
35.3;1w;Phehlukwayo to Zampa, 1 wide nippy bouncer, flying through above the bat as Zampa throws himself at it - he's only a little guy and that was above head height;
35.2;?;Phehlukwayo to Zampa, no run length on off, Zampa taps into the covers;
35.1;1;Phehlukwayo to Hastings, 1 run slower ball, nearly does for Hastings, has a hefty thwack at it and gets a top edge that loops wide of the keeper;
34.6;?;Tahir to Zampa, no run pushed through outside the line of off, steered into the covers;
34.5;?;Tahir to Zampa, no run tossed up and prodded away cautiously;
34.4;?;Tahir to Zampa, no run another rapid legbreak, strikes the pads... but leg side. May have been a slider, actually, out the front of the hand, Zampa was backing away, got an inside edge as well;
34.3;1;Tahir to Hastings, 1 run pushed through outside off, goes back and steers a single through point;
34.2;1;Tahir to Zampa, 1 run on the stumps, maybe the googly, Zampa blocks into a gap and gets off strike;
34.1;W;Tahir to Mennie, OUT ...and it nearly is now, as the returning Imran Tahir slides one through Mennie's defence! Flat and quick from the leggie and it scuttles past a swish to leg, via an inside edge, to hit the top of off;Joe Mennie b Imran Tahir 1 (12m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
33.6;?;Parnell to Hastings, no run banged in short to finish, Hastings limbos back and attempts a ramp over the keeper, fails to connect;

33.4;2;Parnell to Hastings, 2 runs dug out into the leg side, they come back for two;
33.3;6;Parnell to Hastings, SIX runs and again, this time a cross-batted mow down the ground! Not all that short from Parnell but Hastings rocked back and bullocked a swipe over long-on;
33.2;6;Parnell to Hastings, SIX runs pitched up and clubbed... waaaaaaaaaayyyyyy into the leg side, in fact it goes all the way, clearing the rope at wide long-on! Some beef in that hit;
33.1;?;Parnell to Hastings, no run short outside off, Hastings stabs down into the off side;
32.6;1lb;Rabada to Hastings, 1 leg bye fired in, sliding towards leg, deflects off the pad as Hastings stays back;
32.5;1;Rabada to Mennie, 1 run touch full on off, 141kph and Mennie shows it a solid straight bat, they pinch one to mid-off, whose throw misses;
32.5;1w;Rabada to Mennie, 1 wide Mennie shuffles across as Rabada slings one down the leg side;
32.4;1;Rabada to Hastings, 1 run yowzer, that's a spicy meatball, dug in at plus-140kph and Hastings fends it away from in front of his boat race, wide of slip... Think that whacked him on the finger;
32.3;?;Rabada to Hastings, no run angled in on the stumps and pushed back down the track;
32.2;?;Rabada to Hastings, no run pitched up, comes forward to prod into the covers;

31.4;?;Parnell to Hastings, no run Hastings on strike as they crossed, he steers one to backward point;
31.3;W;Parnell to Wade, OUT goes for the homer, maybe not short enough to pull, comes off the splice... and Duminy pouches it on the midwicket boundary! Two in four balls for SA and that probably puts the kibosh on Australia chasing from here;Matthew Wade c Duminy b Parnell 33 (46m 33b 5x4 0x6) SR: 100;
31.2;1;Parnell to Hastings, 1 run round the wicket, slightly short of a length, slashed and slashed hard, thick edge to third man;
31.1;1;Parnell to Wade, 1 run angled in on the stumps and Wade flicks through midwicket - or to midwicket, rather, as an excellent stop means they have to hurry through;
30.6;W;Rabada to Head, OUT rapped on the pad, that's a huge shout, and a long pause for thought for the umpire, but up goes the finger! Australia have reviewed and understandably so, this is vital. He's right across the stumps, and under the new DRS rules, this could be Umpire's Call ... indeed it is!;Travis Head lbw b Rabada 51 (59m 45b 5x4 2x6) SR: 113.33;
30.5;4;Rabada to Head, FOUR runs banged in short, and that's excellent opportunism as Head pulls hard in front of square to bring up his maiden ODI fifty! Well batted;
30.4;?;Rabada to Head, no run back of a length, nudged out to point once more. Nowhere to go for the moment as Australia sit in for the long haul;
30.3;?;Rabada to Head, no run round the wicket, very full again, and point is quickly in to keep the batsman hemmed in;

30.1;1;Rabada to Wade, 1 run round the wicket, and Wade works the angle down to third man;

29.4;?;Steyn to Wade, no run back and across, defended out to gully;
29.3;?;Steyn to Wade, no run ooh, zippy delivery! Wade chased it, it was full and fast, and any bat would surely have flown. But the ball nipped off the deck and eluded everything;
29.2;?;Steyn to Wade, no run back of a length, pushed out to cover;
29.1;1;Steyn to Head, 1 run a fraction short and hauled urgently into the leg side;

27.6;1;Steyn to Head, 1 run on the pads, worked into the leg side to keep the strike;

27.3;?;Steyn to Head, no run full and tight again;
27.2;4;Steyn to Head, FOUR runs tight line and cut off a bottom edge, off the top of the stumps and underneath the diving keeper for four. Unlucky for Steyn but he might, at a pinch, accept the moral victory;
27.1;?;Steyn to Head, no run whistling past the edge, that was rapid and in the channel. No contact;
26.6;1;Tahir to Head, 1 run Head keeps the score ticking with another calm push down the ground;
26.5;1;Tahir to Wade, 1 run worked down to long-on;
26.4;?;Tahir to Wade, no run forward, onto the front foot, firmly pushed into the off side;

25.2;4;Phehlukwayo to Head, FOUR runs slashed hard behind square, and so nearly a hand to that from Rossouw at backward point!;
25.1;6;Phehlukwayo to Head, SIX runs whoosh! Like Sergio at the Ryder Cup, a broad-shouldered bash down the fairway, into the stands at long-off! (And just like Sergio, he's bound now to miss a tiddler for par);
24.6;?;Duminy to Wade, no run poked into the off side. Australia keep themselves afloat with another productive over;
24.5;4;Duminy to Wade, FOUR runs bashed hard into the covers, that's a well placed stroke, and it races past the infield and out of the reach of the sweeper. Shot;
24.4;1;Duminy to Head, 1 run forward and a sharp quick single into the covers;
24.3;1;Duminy to Wade, 1 run in the air for a moment or two but no-one on hand in the covers. Another single into the deep;

21.6;?;Phehlukwayo to Wade, no run an offcutter to finish, tidy work;
21.5;2;Phehlukwayo to Wade, 2 runs sweetly drilled on the up into the covers. But the outfield is very bumpy as Rababa is nutmegged by a late change of direction, a long chase to save his blushes;
21.4;?;Phehlukwayo to Wade, no run tries a flick to leg, but can't connect;
21.3;?;Phehlukwayo to Wade, no run solidly onto the front foot, and poked to cover;

20.6;?;Duminy to Wade, no run down on one knee, looking to paddle the ball fine, but can't find the angle;
20.5;W;Duminy to Warner, OUT short and slammed to short midwicket, and that is the end of Warner! Duminy's golden arm strikes, it was dragged down and could have been dispatched to any corner of the Highveld. Instead, he finds Miller's bucket hands, and that is probably curtains for Australia's hopes!;David Warner c Miller b Duminy 50 (93m 56b 7x4 1x6) SR: 89.28;
20.4;1;Duminy to Head, 1 run crunched through the covers, picks the gap well;

20.1;1;Duminy to Head, 1 run round the wicket, good areas, pushed back to the bowler;
19.6;6;Phehlukwayo to Warner, SIX runs panned high and hard into the stands! Warner isn't giving up the chase just yet! Shorter this time, and climbed alarmingly off the seam, but he was on the back foot and ready to give it everything. Shot. And suddenly a fine over goes for four, six!;
19.5;4;Phehlukwayo to Warner, FOUR runs a bit of width and this time Warner finds the gap in the covers, and the boundary too, as the man in the deep makes an utter horlicks of the attempted gather, lets it through his feet and onto the rope!;
19.4;?;Phehlukwayo to Warner, no run full length, pushing Warner right back onto his stumps. Tidy work;
19.3;?;Phehlukwayo to Warner, no run opens the face in a attempted glide, but can't find the angle;
19.2;?;Phehlukwayo to Warner, no run outside off, crashing back-cut but straight to the man at backward point;
19.1;1;Phehlukwayo to Head, 1 run on the pads, tucked square for another single;
18.6;?;Parnell to Warner, no run outside off and that's another hooter-seeking delivery, just bursting off the turf past a startled edge. Lively!;
18.5;?;Parnell to Warner, no run wicket to wicket, tapped to point;
18.4;1;Parnell to Head, 1 run lashed down to backward point, and once again a forceful stroke is under-rewarded. Still, the hundred is up;
18.3;?;Parnell to Head, no run tight defence on the back foot;
18.2;2;Parnell to Head, 2 runs firmly drilled off the back foot, but that's some sure-footed fielding from Imran Tahir at third man, cutting off a whistling stroke and tumbling to keep it in play;
18.1;1;Parnell to Warner, 1 run tapped into the off side;
17.6;?;Tahir to Head, no run worked off the pad to backward square. Tidy work;
17.5;?;Tahir to Head, no run flogged through the off side but with mid-off up in the ring, there are no freebies on offer;
17.4;?;Tahir to Head, no run driven into the covers, just finding his range;
17.3;1;Tahir to Warner, 1 run drilled down the ground to long-off;
17.2;?;Tahir to Warner, no run forward and blocked into the off side;
17.1;1;Tahir to Head, 1 run onto the front foot and flicked to the leg side;
16.6;1;Parnell to Head, 1 run nurdled off the hip to keep the runs ticking in a very lively over!;
16.5;6;Parnell to Head, SIX runs that's the way to do it! If there's lift in the deck, get underneath it and lash it high over third man for six!;
16.4;?;Parnell to Head, no run fiery work again as Parnell whistles another one through to the keeper, a touch of movement away from the left-hander;
16.3;?;Parnell to Head, no run this one explodes as well, real zip off the deck as Head lines up a cut but finds himself cramped for room and struck right on the top of his handle!;
16.2;?;Parnell to Head, no run zinger! Outside off, exploding off the deck, and drawing a rather startled jab from the new batsman. Pace and bounce, all the attributes;
16.1;W;Parnell to Marsh, OUT ... like I was saying ... down the leg side, bouncing alarming and catching the glove, and de Kock shuffles to his left to pouch the opportunity!;Mitchell Marsh c ?de Kock b Parnell 19 (24m 19b 4x4 0x6) SR: 100;
15.6;?;Tahir to Warner, no run tossed up outside off, angles the bat on the back foot but backward point stops this;
15.5;2;Tahir to Warner, 2 runs Warner drops back, think this was the Bosie and he plays it very late, gets it past the fielder for a couple;
15.4;?;Tahir to Warner, no run pushed through on the stumps, Warner presses out to block;
15.3;?;Tahir to Warner, no run angled across the southpaw, who sits back and tickles towards short third man;
15.2;1;Tahir to Marsh, 1 run goes straighter, full and flighted and bunted down the ground;
15.1;1;Tahir to Warner, 1 run floats the ball up outside the line of off, Warner reaches to slap through the covers;
14.6;1lb;Parnell to Warner, 1 leg bye slightly short, on the hips and worked around the corner for one - maybe off the padding;

14.4;1;Parnell to Marsh, 1 run pitched up, invites the drive, gets a thick edge through backward square leg;
14.3;?;Parnell to Marsh, no run good length on off, 136kph and Marsh blocks this one securely;
14.2;4;Parnell to Marsh, FOUR runs oh, you jammy devil! Marsh gets four more, this time via the inside edge as he propped forwards, can't have been far from taking leg stump;
14.1;4;Parnell to Marsh, FOUR runs dug in, slightly leg side and Marsh gets some glove on the pull, sends it wide of de Kock and that'll be four;
13.6;1;Tahir to Marsh, 1 run pushed through a bit quicker, Marsh stays back and jabs to the left of extra cover, could have been tight if the pick up was clean;
13.5;?;Tahir to Marsh, no run tossed up outside the line of off, leans into a prod to cover;
13.4;?;Tahir to Marsh, no run there's the wrong'un, coming back in as the batsman chops to midwicket;

13.2;1;Tahir to Warner, 1 run floated up outside off, Warner comes forward and punches through mid-off;
13.1;4;Tahir to Warner, FOUR runs spiders in and puts the ball on a length, not much turn and Warner drops back to glides the ball to the third-man fence;
12.6;?;Parnell to Marsh, no run Parnell has found his groove, this flies through at 137kph as Marsh shoudlers arms - now they're not swinging (which is probably wise as Australia need some watchfully rapid consolidation. If that makes any sense);
12.5;?;Parnell to Marsh, no run back of a length once again, tapped down towards point;
12.4;?;Parnell to Marsh, no run dug in at 138kph from round the wicket, tucked to the leg side;

11.5;?;Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run pitched up, steps into the drive but this time finds mid-on;
11.4;4;Phehlukwayo to Marsh, FOUR runs oh, that's even better, too full from Phehlukwayo and Marsh pings a supremely timed drive back past mid-on;
11.3;4;Phehlukwayo to Marsh, FOUR runs doesn't take long for Marsh to open up, offered a modicum of width and he mows a drive through backward point to get off the mark with a boundary;
11.2;?;Phehlukwayo to Marsh, no run back of a length on off stump, poked into the covers;
11.1;1;Phehlukwayo to Warner, 1 run short ball, worked off the hips for a single;
10.6;W;Parnell to Bailey, OUT bowled him, off stump pegged back! The pressure was building on Bailey and he went for the big shot, aiming down the ground but it wasn't quite there, seamed a fraction and he played around it as Parnell hit the bull's eye. Parnell then starts dabbing in celebration... that or he's short-circuiting;George Bailey b Parnell 9 (23m 18b 2x4 0x6) SR: 50;

9.6;1;Rabada to Warner, 1 run length ball outside off, 144kph and punched on the up into the covers;
9.5;?;Rabada to Warner, no run pinned in front, that stayed low... but umpire Llong walks away! After some deliberation, SA ask for the review. They desperately want to get rid of Warner, but this won't be the ball, as it pitched well outside leg stump. Looked like it would have been fuller, given the height at which it went through;
9.4;?;Rabada to Warner, no run back of a length, pushed across and Warner comes forward to block;
9.3;?;Rabada to Warner, no run shortish and this beats Warner on the inside, maybe clips the edge before thudding into the pads;
9.2;?;Rabada to Warner, no run on the stumps and pushed into the off side;
9.1;4;Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs stand and deliver, crashed through the covers, though Rossouw nearly pulls off a screamer diving to his right! It was in the air was quite a way, between two fielders and then skittering away to the rope - that's the 50 up;
9.1;1w;Rabada to Warner, 1 wide short and slightly leg side, Warner flicks and misses;
8.6;?;Steyn to Bailey, no run beats the bat to finish the over, a fizzing legbreak from slightly back of a length, Bailey whistles in the wind from deep in the crease;
8.5;?;Steyn to Bailey, no run Steyn's dander is up after that, hammers the pitch halfway down, 137kph and defended from the crease;
8.4;4;Steyn to Bailey, FOUR runs minor victory for the bowler, finding the outside edge... but Bailey plays it well, soft hands and opening the face to send it fine of third man;
8.3;1;Steyn to Warner, 1 run Steyn digs this in and Warner plays a pull, rolling the wrists out to deep square leg;
8.2;?;Steyn to Warner, no run shortish and turned off the body to leg;
8.1;4;Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs there's Warner with the bit between his teeth again, steps out and laces a precision drive between extra cover and mid-off, four more, please;
7.6;4;Rabada to Bailey, FOUR runs ach, he's got that wrong, a slower ball comes out as a full toss and Bailey bludges it gratefully through the covers for a first boundary;
7.5;?;Rabada to Bailey, no run fullish, outside off, reaches for the drive and inside-edges to leg;
7.4;?;Rabada to Bailey, no run quicker still, 143kph and Bailey can't do anything with it back in the crease;
7.3;?;Rabada to Bailey, no run shorter, rising up at 140kph and fended away in front of the stumps;
7.2;?;Rabada to Bailey, no run better line, Bailey's turned around on off stump, takes the edge but fails short;
7.1;?;Rabada to Bailey, no run pitched up outside off, Bailey stands and clunks a cut-cum-drive off the toe of the bat;
6.6;4;Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs dug in short and Warner hits back with a left cross, swung hard up over midwicket and it races away in front of square for four;
6.5;1;Steyn to Bailey, 1 run nasty, rising ball, 138kph at the ribs, fended away behind square for Bailey's first run;
6.4;?;Steyn to Bailey, no run angled in straighter, menacing the stumps as Bailey hangs back, blunts it into the off side;
6.3;?;Steyn to Bailey, no run good shape on this, 132kph and fading away as Bailey plays inside the line;
6.2;?;Steyn to Bailey, no run slightly back of a length, tapped down into the off side;
6.2;1w;Steyn to Bailey, 1 wide welcomes the new man with a bumper, Bailey bails out early... too high;
6.1;W;Steyn to Smith, OUT fired down leg, thick inside edge... WHADDACATCH!!! Steyn gets Smith, though he has de Kock to thank, he flew to his left to hold the chance one-handed, before tumbling and rising in delight to be mobbed by his team-mates. Smiffy's gotta go, via to a worldie from Quinny; the only thing that perhaps helped was that Steyn bowled it so far down leg he knew where he had to start moving early;Steven Smith c ?de Kock b Steyn 14 (21m 12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 116.66;
5.6;4;Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs short ball, looked to have hurried him... but Warner still manages to bludgeon it through midwicket for four, pulled off the splice of the bat but it outruns the fielder;
5.5;?;Rabada to Warner, no run the change-up works this time, an offcutter deceives Warner, who inside-edges on to his body;
5.4;?;Rabada to Warner, no run Rabada puts it on a length, middle and leg stump at 142kph, worked towards mid-on;
5.4;1w;Rabada to Warner, 1 wide banged in but down the leg side;
5.3;?;Rabada to Warner, no run back of a length, slightly wider and inviting the cut, only manages a bottom edge through to the keeper on the bounce;
5.2;?;Rabada to Warner, no run shortish and angled across on off, Warner jabs it away;
5.1;1;Rabada to Smith, 1 run fired in full and flicked through backward square leg;
4.6;?;Steyn to Warner, no run touch short, 138kph on the body, spits at Warner and he again is concerned only with defusing the threat;
4.5;?;Steyn to Warner, no run back of a length over middle and leg, Warner chops down on it;
4.4;1;Steyn to Smith, 1 run goes back and works a straighter delivery through the leg side;
4.3;2;Steyn to Smith, 2 runs takes the pace off this, sits up outside off and stunned behind backward point moving across;
4.2;?;Steyn to Smith, no run length ball, tighter to the stumps and blocked into the covers;
4.1;?;Steyn to Smith, no run touch short outside off and Smith leaps into line and effects a gunslinger's pose as he attempt to flay another square drive but picks out the fielder;
3.6;?;Rabada to Warner, no run fires to ball in full, serious heat at 148kph and Warner has to jam his bat down on it;
3.6;1w;Rabada to Warner, 1 wide dug in short, climbing through above Warner... called on height;
3.5;?;Rabada to Warner, no run tucking him up at 143kph, Warner hops back and turns down into the leg side;
3.4;?;Rabada to Warner, no run flying through in the channel outside off, left alone;
3.3;?;Rabada to Warner, no run good length on the stumps, Warner pushes it back towards mid-on;
3.2;4;Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs lashed through point, Warner capitalises on a bit of width and dishes out some treatment to Rabada in kind;

2.6;1;Steyn to Smith, 1 run straighter line from Steyn, shuffles across and works one to square leg;
2.5;4;Steyn to Smith, FOUR runs two in a row! Smith squints and picks up the gauntlet, using the pace again to fire a 142kph delivery between cover and point;
2.4;4;Steyn to Smith, FOUR runs that's a corking shot to get off the mark with, 139kph outside off, maybe a fraction short and Smith fillets it through cover;
2.3;1;Steyn to Warner, 1 run banged in short and this time Warner is in control of the pull down to fine leg;
2.2;?;Steyn to Warner, no run pace and bounce, rolls his fingers over it and sends a 142kph delivery jagging away past the outside edge;
2.1;?;Steyn to Warner, no run dug in short and Warner tries to tuck to leg, bottom-edges just past his stumps, I think;
1.6;?;Rabada to Smith, no run angled in and holding its line, 144kph and past the outside edge again. This is going to be quite a test;
1.5;?;Rabada to Smith, no run unplayable! That went straight through Smith as he tried to defend on off stump, just did enough off the deck at a sizzling speed;
1.4;1lb;Rabada to Warner, 1 leg bye Rabada's burning rubber with these wheels, 146kph and hitting the pads, possibly too high and the ball flies to slip... whose throw is then tipped past midwicket by Rabada in his follow through, gifting a single;
1.3;?;Rabada to Warner, no run beats the outside edge, that's a snorting ball, too. Warner hung bat and swished, so close to nicking off;
1.2;W;Rabada to Finch, OUT short ball, Finch scoops it straight up - bagged by Behardien at square leg! Done for pace, I suspect, looking to get on with it, as he had to, but the stroke was all sorts of wrong, hoicked up like a white flag and South Africa have their first;Aaron Finch c Behardien b Rabada 1 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
1.1;1;Rabada to Warner, 1 run angled across and dabbed down behind square on the off side;
0.6;?;Steyn to Finch, no run cripes, another jaffa to finish with, fired in and then zipping away off a length, this close to Finch's outside edge;
0.5;1;Steyn to Warner, 1 run pitched up and pushed a little wide, steered through backward point from the crease;
0.4;?;Steyn to Warner, no run oof, takes this in the midriff, at 144kph, too! Slightly short and David Warner's first ball has him hopping around the crease;
0.3;1;Steyn to Finch, 1 run draws him forward, reaching for the ball away from his body as it seams a fraction, keeps it down in front of point and an diving stop keeps them to one;
0.2;?;Steyn to Finch, no run fullish, tight line of off stump, gets bat on it this time and blocks to cover;
0.1;?;Steyn to Finch, no run that's a ripper to start with, leaping like an electrocuted trout off a length, Finch looked startled as he dropped the hands and the ball boomed into the keeper's gloves;

Ahoy there, shall we do this? Aaron Finch is scratching his mark and preparing to give it some humpty as Australia seek to chase down what would be a record targets for them in ODIs. Dale Steyn won't be giving anything away easily, though...
