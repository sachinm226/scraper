2.06pm Innings break Australia bowled out with six balls to go for 307 after they were 2 for 223 with 16 overs to go. Amir was outstanding. He pegged Australia back single handedly after David Warner's outstanding century.
Warner: "I think I left a few out there. Getting out with 70 balls to spare is a bit disappointing after a cracking start. But the second spell from Mohammad Amir was outstanding. Credit to him. For us we've got to come out here and bowl Test match line and length and be very disciplined. I think the pitch is good. We saw a pitch map that showed Pakistan were a bit too short early. So we've got to put it up there and allow them to drive. I think if you start well up front and take early wickets you're a good chance. We've got to bowl well."
Australia lost 10 for 161 off 28 overs after Aaron Finch and Warner's brilliant opening stand.
Senthil Kumar: "Amir was struggling to get a place in Pakistan World Cup squad. Look at him now, absolutely brilliant"
Hasan: "How good was that from Pakistan! Just when it looked like we were going to see the first 400 in this WC, pulling Australia back from 218/2 after 33 overs to 307 all out is a monumental effort. Luckily, both Pakistans turned up today. Wahab was good with the ball, but spare a thought for Amir: given the context of the game, this has to be, undoubtedly, the spell of the tournament so far. "
A comeback to match that of Pakistan took place in men's golf this year, and understandably all eyes at the U.S. Open that starts tomorrow are bound to hone in on Tiger Woods, and his trusted companion Frank. Wait...who's this Frank?
Readers in India, while you wait for Pakistan to come out to bat, fancy having a look at that Warner innings once again? Here are the highlights, on Hotstar.

14.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Finch, no run shorter length, he's back and defending to cover;
14.2;?;Wahab Riaz to Finch, no run huge appeal for LBW given not out. Pakistan review. He was hit deep in the crease just at the top of the pad. No bat.

Australia's openers are out there. Aaron Finch will take strike with Warner at the other end. Amir has the new ball.
Sid Monga: This is the ground where Mohammad Amir played his first first-class match on comeback. And he played a big part in bowling Somerset out for 128, and none other than Marcus Trescothick praised him for swinging the ball, and swinging it late. Pakistan will want much of that in a few minutes' time.
Both teams are out there for the anthems.
Baskar: "Finally, we might see Smith rolling his arm today after a long time. Interestingly today, both the teams depend on an all-rounder who rarely complete their bowling quota." Will be interesting. He did a bit of bowling in the warm-up games. He didn't bowl a lot when he was captain.
Marshall Raja: "Aus and swinging ball. There could be only one winner. Why do they always get to bat in overcast conditions."
Rajesh Banda: "@Alex - you forgot to greet viewers from Asian coutries and it is afternoon here in India.. :P " I did. Apologies. Good afternoon to you all!
10.20am So, ten minutes to go until the first ball. I reckon it could be a lively first hour. Here's Alex Malcolm to tell you all about it...
Thanks Andrew. Morning all. Or evening, if you're in Australia or New Zealand. Big test for Australia against the new ball. Mohammad Amir has been very good in the first Powerplay in this World Cup so far.
Meanwhile, the NBA Finals are tantalisingly poised with Toronto Raptors leading the Golden State Warriors 3-2 going into Thursday's match. Who holds the edge, and what is the latest on Kevin Durant's injury? Find out here
10.14am Yasir Lodhi: "I don't think sitting Shadab out is a wise decision even with Green Top pitch. Shadab has been their striking bowler in middle overs whereas Shaheen Afridi has struggled big time even against weaker opposition like Afghanistan." It's curious isn't it, especially given Taunton's nickname is "Ciderabad", given how spin-friendly Somerset's wickets tend to be ...
Osman Samiuddin has been off his long run on the #LiveReport in response to Shadab's omission ... get it while it's hot!
sanjeev kakarap: "You never know who is going to be the impact player from the opposition when you play against Pakistan or Australia. Lets wait and see? Hopefully the skies will be clear in the Taunton today"
10.07am Adnan Ali: "History will tell you Australia will win this match.. but watching last match of Pakistan against England, and then analysing score card of Pakistan batting in last two series make it in doubt that Australia will be favorites.. this will be a tight match.." Damn right. It's rarely less than fascinating when these two meet!
Pakistan will be wearing black armbands in memory of two fellow countrymen, the former player, Akhtar Sarfraz, who died at the age of 43 this week, and the former Test umpire Riazuddin, who stood in 12 Tests between 1990 and 2002.
Pakistan win the toss and bowl first! "A bit of grass, looks like a green pitch, a bit of moisture," says Sarfraz. "Unfortunately we didn't play the last game, but worked hard with lots of practice."
Aaron Finch says he would have bowled first too... "One-off games in different conditions, you expect to come up against the best. It'll have to be wait-and-see what the wicket does first-up." Richardson, with his death bowling, gets in ahead of Jason Behrendorff as Zampa sits out, as does Nathan Lyon.
Australia 1 David Warner, 2 Aaron Finch (capt), 3 Usman Khawaja, 4 Steven Smith, 5 Shaun Marsh, 6 Glenn Maxwell, 7 Alex Carey (wk), 8 Nathan Coulter-Nile, 9 Pat Cummins, 10 Mitchell Starc, 11 Kane Richardson
And no Shadab for Pakistan, Shaheen Afridi comes in. Interestingly. It's seam or bust for both sides today!
Pakistan 1 Imam-ul-Haq, 2 Fakhar Zaman, 3 Babar Azam, 4 Mohammad Hafeez, 5 Sarfaraz Ahmed (capt & wk), 6 Shoaib Malik, 7 Asif Ali, 8 Wahab Riaz, 9 Hasan Ali, 10 Shaheen Afridi, 11 Mohammad Amir
10am Right, let's have a toss, shall we?
9.57am Murthy: "From India, I would love to see if Wahab Riaz gets his best figures today. He bowled his heart out in 2019 match....." Indeed ... that was fun! Shane Watson was all but decapitated ... but lived to fight another day!
9.55am Right, five minutes to the toss, which means you've got a split-second to adjust your Cricket Picks for today's game. After all, it is Pakistan. Which side of bed have they got out of? I'm sensing something today ... that's all I'm saying ...
Yash: "OK all set. Got my coffee, muffins almost done in the oven, got my books because exam next week (don't do medicine kids), TV is on, laptop set, cricinfo on the phone. If it rains, I will burn everything to the ground. "
9.48am Right, ten minutes until the toss. So let's get stuck into some required reading for today's game. Monga is concerned about David Warner's rather defensive mindset after a rather stately start to his World Cup. While Osman is riffing on Fakhar, Imam and Babar at the top of the order, Pakistan's heartbeat
Afnan Ahmed: "Thank you CricInfo. Been on a plane from Oslo to Singapore and straight into all day meetings. Now instead of going to sleep, I look forward to you in bringing all of us a great match :) "
9.41am Ammar Ahmed: "Andrew, how many more losses can realistically knock SA chances of qualifying for the semis?" None... they are in last-chance saloon already. Five wins in a row is surely the minimum.
Suryansh : "Ok guys, help me with one thing. What happens if wc semi-final are abandoned due to rains (including reserve days)? And the same happens for finals? Another hypothetical scenario - starting today if all games are abandoned because of rain, who will win the world cup? NZ?" Well seeing as it's in England at the moment, I guess we keep it.
9.34am Anns Mahboob: "If Andrew's commentary today is remotely similar to his live report the other day from the rain affected match, we are all in for a great treat!" Why thank you, but I rather hope it isn't... much as I love commentating on cloud formations, I secretly quite like actual cricket too!
dez: "Here's your cut & paste for the first ball (delete names as appropriate) - Amir/Starc steams in, good length ball just outside off stump. Jags back in a long way, through the gate & Finch/Imam's leg stump is floored. What a start!!" It's on my clipboard, just in case ...
Ali Kehar: "If Pakistan play four quicks, they will have to put shadab out which i think would be a very bad decision. Even if they leave the extra batsmen out, shadab will come in at 7 which makes the batting that much weaker and unbalanced." The poor lamb may not be able to feel his fingers today, which may be a factor ...
Yoel: "Say it out, Say it loud Cricket is on today, Give or take a cloud"
9.30am Looking like four quicks for Pakistan, says Osman Samiuddin, our other lurker on the boundary's edge. He's straining his eyes to see which of the pace options is sulking and kicking cones around the outfield.
Hamza: "Ohh come on please tell me if I'm right already? The weather forecasts for Taunton today says that the weather is pretty cloudy for the entire day, but no rain, am I right? " You might be right... but you might not be! It's the English summer, anything could happen!
John: "All the initial messages suggest that we could atleast get some Cricket back again today! Hurray!" I strongly believe this to be the case, yes ...
9.29am Warner's going slow, Zampa's bowling half-trackers, the batsmen bar Smith aren't having a great time of it yet, but Australia have Mitchell Starc and World Cup aura. How far can those two take them? 'It's just two knockout games, and weird things happen', says Jarrod Kimber on our latest Talking World Cup episode (you can subscribe on Apple Podcasts here, if that's your thing)
9.23am "Both teams are warming up," says Monga, through swift chugs of Old Monk. "Lots of beanies around. The pitch has been under covers for two days. Definitely a bowl-first day. Pitch looks green. Langer and Arthur have hugged. Warner is chatting with Clarke and Vaughan. Starc and Richardson have marked their runs. Afridi has too. Hasan too. It's cold but it's all happening."
I couldn't have put it better myself, so I won't. But the fact that Richardson is pacing his run out adds weight to the rumour of two changes to Australia's team. Stoinis and Zampa out, Shaun Marsh and Richardson in. Sit tight, and all shall be revealed!
Khurram: "Good morning to all, here is the Weather report for today's match: 11?C, Wind NE at 16 km/h, 92% Humidity. Its cloudy here in Taunton but very less chance of rain & more chance of game, don't forget its England weather which is one minute down, next minute up. " My work here is done. Cut and paste is the future of live comms!
9.15am Good morning all, and welcome to the latest installment of the Great South Western Rain Dodge... yes, after consecutive wash-outs in Bristol, we've gone bombing down the M5 to Taunton today, for Pakistan against Australia, one of the more storied rivalries in World Cup history. ... not least on English soil. Will today be a repeat of this epic encounter ... or this less-than-epic finale? Or just a repeat of this less-than-fully-formed last outing for Pakistan at the current World Cup...?
Well, without further ado, let's cross to our huddled masses in the Taunton press-box ... Sidharth Monga is lurking at this match for us, and he enthusiastically informs us: "It looks fairly miserable. But dry." Hurrah!
 Innings Start
6.20pm: Well, at least both teams beat the rain, eh? This was shaping up to probably the finish of the tournament so far, until Starc and Australia nipped out the last three wickets in nine balls to ensure a comfortable-enough margin of victory... Anyway, thanks for chipping in, you can go over everything on the Live Report and then we'll have Danyal's considered wrap on the site soon. There's another pretty tasty match-up tomorrow, heavens permitting, so make sure to join us again for that. From myself, Miller and Alex (and Ranjith), it's cheerio for now!
6.10pm: Presentations time, Sarfaraz Ahmed first up: "Definitely, the batting was short and that's why we lost the match, Hasan batted well, Wahab batted well, we fought but could not win. We conceded too many runs first 20 overs, except for Amir the other bowlers did not bowl well, 270-80 was [par]. If we want to win, the fop four have to make runs. Imam made fifty, Babar made 30, but the top four must score runs. [Next game v India?] We will try our level best."
Australia captain Aaron Finch: "They certainly did [run it close], it's always tough when you've got guys like Hasan and Wahab coming out and swinging. When they get on a roll it can be tough to stop. We had to bowl our best ball, yorker or length, if your execution is off you go out of the ground. Disappointing we didn't bat out 50 overs, when you go in with an extra better. We probably tried to go too hard too early and ended up 20-30 runs short. But great we still got the two points despite not finishing off. It was a tough call, when you lose your allrounder you have to chose an extra better or bowler. We backed Maxwell to bowl ten overs, he got seven out and I managed to sneak a couple."
6pm: The points go with green and gold, Australia completing a 41-run win despite the best efforts of the Pakistan tail. Taunton was jumping to the Jailbreak Rock for a while, but in the end the curate's egg turned out to be mostly bad for Pakistan. Australia move up to six points with their third win, and that is a setback for Sarfaraz Ahmed's men in green, who showed flashes of what they were capable of but ultimately couldn't hold it together.
David Warner is named Man of the Match: "When I got out we had 70 balls to go, as the 'in' batter you want to bat 50 overs. We should have been around 340-50, credit to Pakistan, their second spells were fantastic and made it hard for us to hit down the ground. It was a used wicket and a touch dry, they bowled very straight lines, gave me no width, I just had to come out [and grind]... bit of movement early on, had to be tighter and climb into the back-of-a-length balls. For us it's about the way we finished, some great knocks for Pakistan, Wahab freeing his arms. Our bowlers bowled fantastic, they probably got closer than we expected but it was a great game."

10.5;W;Coulter-Nile to Babar Azam, OUT short, and slapped straight to Richardson on the fence! That's a body blow! Babar's drives alone were going to win this game at a canter. But he's lured into a response to the bouncer, and doesn't come close to getting his wrists over the ball. Dragged down from way over his head like an amateur fly-fisherman, and backward square is in business again;Babar Azam c Richardson b Coulter-Nile 30 (37m 28b 7x4 0x6) SR: 107.14;

7.6;?;Kane Richardson to Imam-ul-Haq, no run through to the keeper;

7.4;?;Kane Richardson to Babar Azam, no run worked into the covers, off the back foot;
7.3;4;Kane Richardson to Babar Azam, FOUR runs pinged off the pads, out through the leg side. Babar's bottom hand comes off the bat as he reaches round to time his clip, and it sizzles to the rope!;
7.2;1;Kane Richardson to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run on the back foot, worked to the leg side;
7.1;?;Kane Richardson to Imam-ul-Haq, no run finds the edge this time as Imam pushes with hard hands! But falls short of slip, surprisingly. That was a genuine nick;

5.4;4;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs too full, too obvious! Imam knew it was coming, the attempted yorker, but with no swing, it was a simple flick through the leg-side from a well-set, well-balanced batsman!;
5.3;4;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs short, slashed, clear of the slips! Short again from Starc, but on a wider line. Imam's reflexive pull takes a fat toe-end and soars over the cordon!;
5.2;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run outside off, and this one takes off from the deck! Another beauty, but Imam to his credit refuses to be drawn into a nibble as he holds the line of off stump;
5.1;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run on the back foot, blocked down into the crease;

3.4;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run 91mph, into the toes, but Imam is well placed to block it back down the pitch;
3.3;4;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, FOUR runs short, and clattered! Imam takes no prisoners with that pull! A decent bouncer, well directed, but he's right on top of the stroke, rifling it through square leg!;
3.2;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run back of a length, angled into the legs, nudged to midwicket;
3.1;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run tapped into the covers, pressing forward from deep in the crease;
2.6;?;Cummins to Babar Azam, no run head over the ball, solid block;
2.5;4;Cummins to Babar Azam, FOUR runs stand and deliver! Babar waits for the over-pitch outside off. No footwork, but none needed! Just launching the hands through the arc and away to the point boundary!;

2.3;?;Cummins to Babar Azam, no run through to the keeper on a tight off-stump line. Babar leaves well alone;
2.2;?;Cummins to Babar Azam, no run on the back foot, cautiously blocked into the off side;
2.1;W;Cummins to Zaman, OUT back of a length, the first hint of width of the innings, so Fakhar climbs into the cut with hard hands, Richardson at third man is expertly positioned and gobbles the flying edge. That was a sucker punch, and Pakistan's hopes of a composed start are already looking wobbly;Fakhar Zaman c Richardson b Cummins 0 (12m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
1.6;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run huge appeal! Starc goes half a yard fuller, and suddenly that jag off the seam is right up to the edge of the bat. Did it graze through to the keeper? The Aussies decline the review;
1.5;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run over the wicket, outside off, hitting the seam and climbing through to the keeper as Imam drives uppishly with hard hands;
1.4;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run stands tall on the back foot, solid defence back down the track, half a thought of a single but Starc swoops quickly to send Fakhar scurrying for his crease;
1.3;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run another one jags wickedly off the seam, as Imam plays inside the line with a vertical bat;
1.2;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run tapped back down the pitch;
1.1;?;Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, no run this one goes like a 88mph offbreak! Pitches on off, turns a mile off the seam;
0.6;?;Cummins to Zaman, no run sizzler! Pitches on the left-hander's off stump, goes with the angle, climbs past the outside edge as Fakhar holds his line;
0.5;?;Cummins to Zaman, no run back of a length, off-stump line, tough to take on that sort of ball so Fakhar shoulders arms and accepts it as a sighter;
0.4;1;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 run poor ball, on the toes, clipped behind square but well enough gathered on the bounce by the sweeper;
0.3;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run wicket-to-wicket line, blocked stoutly on an off-stump line, gathered at midwicket;
0.2;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run nibbling off the seam, that's a lovely line, beating a cautious back-foot prod;
0.1;?;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, no run good wheels! Zipping through a wild pull, no contact whatsoever. Justice is done in the end;
0.1;1nb;Cummins to Imam-ul-Haq, (no ball) tight line and length, on the back foot, but an over-step! It's a free hit coming up! In fact, it shouldn't have been called, but too late now...;

2.32pm Here come the players. Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq to lead the line in what is ostensibly a daunting target, but is little more than a run-a-ball ... and in this day and age, it's not out of the question, especially for a side that was scoring 340-plus for fun against England recently... (okay, and losing...)
2.27pm Hello again... well, we've got a contest here, in spite of everything. When Aaron Finch and David Warner were in harness, there were visions of 400 flitting through the Australian dressing-room. Instead they've scraped past 300 after a stunning spell from Mohammad Amir. But anything he can do, Mitchell Starc can surely match it ... don't stray far! The chase will be underway any minute now ...
Mike Hussey, our Match Day studio analyst, reckons Warner's innings was liking watching the batsman of old ...
Rahul Pagaria: "For almost two decades, the cricketing world has been praising the fighting spirits of other teams or players against Australia, while Australia winning with comfortable margins. I reckon today will be the same day with all praises for Amir, but still, Aussies winning in the end."
