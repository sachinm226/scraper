11.25am: That was another fine display of ruthlessness from Australia, who've wrapped up the England innings inside the first hour. After plodding stodgily through most of the first day, England lost 6 for 53 from almost the moment the new ball was taken - another dispiriting example of decline and fall, another meagre first-innings total.

42.1;W;Harris to Root, OUT lovely outswinger, right on the money and that's out!

40.1;2;Johnson to Root, 2 runs and it's runs for Root, off a thick outside edge which runs through backward point along the ground...should have been three runs, but only a brace which means he stays facing MJ;
39.6;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run defended to the covers, a terrific battle between these two. A bowler who knows he has the wood a batsman, and a great batsman at that;

35.6;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run oh, boy, he wanted that off-the-mark single as he dropped this into the off side but then screamed 'no no' to Root who was about to respond. All ends okay.;
35.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run not quite in control of that drive, skews off a thick outer part of the part but it's along the ground to point;

21.5;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run length, a foot or two wide of the stumps, nothing doing from the batsman again;
21.4;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run back of a length, in the channel outside off, Carberry drops his hands;

16.6;1;Siddle to Root, 1 run outside off, goes back and drops the hands, guides the ball towards backward point and they run one on a misfield;
16.5;W;Siddle to Cook, OUT pushed across, Cook nibbles and he's gone! Caught at second slip, an indecorous prod from Cook that seemed to betray the muddled state of mind he has got into with his batting, gulled into hanging his bat out and a thick edge flew to Clarke. Like a man reaching for another chocolate late on Christmas day, Cook couldn't resist temptation there;Alastair Cook c Clarke b Siddle 27 (70m 47b 3x4 0x6) SR: 57.44;
16.4;?;Siddle to Cook, no run on the pads, Cook had gone across and misses with a flick, the ball just grazing the trouser leg on its way to Haddin;
16.3;?;Siddle to Cook, no run pitched up, steady stuff from Siddle outside off, left this time;
16.2;1;Siddle to Carberry, 1 run short and straying to leg, pulled round the corner for a single;
16.1;1;Siddle to Cook, 1 run length ball angled across outside off, Cook opens the face and steers behind backward point, the collect and throw are quick but even taking into account a moment's hesitation, Carberry made his ground;
15.6;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run full and on the stumps, leans out to defend with a straight bat - another tidy maiden for Lyon, who's found that unobtrusive groove of his;
15.5;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run floated up a little wider, gets a stride in and lets the ball through;
15.4;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run quicker and flatter and the ball thuds into Haddin's gloves as Carberry cuts hard and misses, to excited groans from the close catchers;

11.5;?;Lyon to Cook, no run driven square to point, Warner is quickly across;

10.6;?;Harris to Cook, no run he learns from his previous error and has nothing to do with this...three maidens in a row;
10.5;?;Harris to Cook, no run beaten! That's loose from Cook who has been very good so far, was quite wide from Harris and Cook was drawn into driving but it wasn't quite as full as he thought;
10.4;?;Harris to Cook, no run defended on the back foot and it bobbles to short leg;
10.3;?;Harris to Cook, no run left alone outside off;
10.2;?;Harris to Cook, no run half an appeal from the Australians, for a few things...more likely an inside edge. The ball nipped back at Cook, beat the inside edge and took the top of the bat to Haddin. Not far from lbw, but missing off stump on that call, too;

6.4;?;Harris to Carberry, no run edged! Did it carry? Yes, dropped at third slip by Smith diving across, one-handed, to his left. Carberry pushing forward at a good-length ball outside off. Thick edge. It might have reached Clarke at second but Smith committed;
6.3;?;Harris to Carberry, no run back to leaving it alone;
6.2;?;Harris to Carberry, no run there's the error, drawn into driving at a full delivery outside off - 146kph - it moved late and scooted past the outside edge;
6.1;?;Harris to Carberry, no run Harris is certainly getting the ball to zing through, Haddin taking it on the rise and there's a hint of shape back into the left hander;
5.6;?;Siddle to Cook, no run keeps it outside off stump, nothing offered from Cook;
5.5;?;Siddle to Cook, no run pulls the length back a fraction to Cook who leaves alone;
5.4;1;Siddle to Carberry, 1 run he's pitching it very full, almost yorker length, and it's squeezed into midwicket;

5.2;3;Siddle to Cook, 3 runs well driven, very full outside off, Cook getting a good stride forward and places it wide of mid-off although it doesn't have quite enough to reach the long boundary;
5.1;1;Siddle to Carberry, 1 run full on middle and leg, Carberry gets a thick inside down to fine leg to open his scoring;

4.2;?;Harris to Cook, no run full and wider, a tempter, but Cook isn't tempted;
4.1;?;Harris to Cook, no run that's his best ball of the morning so far, short of a length and nips away off the seam past Cook's outside...the England captain feeling for it;

3.5;4;Johnson to Cook, FOUR runs another positive shot from Cook, drives a very full delivery through the off side...no big follow through to the shot, more a punch and it dribbled into the rope;

1.2;2;Johnson to Cook, 2 runs low full toss on middle and leg, Cook clips it through midwicket to get himself up and running;
1.1;?;Johnson to Cook, no run starts full at off stump, 141kph, and Cook defends it firmly back down the pitch;

Ryan Harris with the opening over. He has three slips, a gully and a short leg
Michael Clarke gets his players in a huddle and here they come into the middle to a great reception...England's openers will follow shortly. Sit back and enjoy, folks.
The anthems are done, the players head off again to do their last minute preparations. The ground is packed. Looks terrific. One of the great sporting stadiums.
Kritesh: "With due respect to Anderson, he has looked tired and jaded throughout this tour. He should have been rested. You do not want your best bowler to breakdown physically and mentally. Poor call by Cook and Flower."
10.25am We are set for the pomp and ceremony that precedes Ashes Tests these days...George Bailey, who is on the microphone, says he'd bought tickets to come and watch this Test with his dad about a month ago before earning an Ashes call-up.
10.20am Here's a good spot from Pete Church: "While the Bairstow's will be the first father-son to start a match as keepers for England, the Parks's got there first in 1986 when Bobby kept as a sub when Bruce French was injured - a match more famous for Bob Taylor being called up from the hospitality tent to keep."
Ali Raza thinks England have made the right decisions on selection. "This is the best English team playing in this Ashes."
10.15am Cook and Carberry will be in the dressing room strapping on the pads with Australia's new-ball attack eager to get at them. Will be interesting to see if there's a change of mindset from the England batsmen after the success of Ben Stokes at the WACA who showed some intent.
Brendan: "With Pieterson not showing any sort of leadership (being an experienced player and all), I find it a real shame Ballance hasn't been picked. He's worked so hard."
Rod Wood: "Strange call by Clarke. Australia don't chase well. Thats a decision he may regret." The way England have been playing he may not have many to chase, Rod
ziggy: "Can't believe England haven't selected one of their tall fast men, typical defensive and unimaginative selection from the England selectors." Broad's playing. Isn't he tall and quick? But, yes, I get your point. Not exactly earning their tour fees.
10.05am So that's the important early news out of the way. Clarke was pretty unsure what to do, but at 3-0 up it's quite nice to be able to try something that wouldn't come naturally. You get the feeling Cook wanted to bowl.
Bairstow's selection means he and his late father David David become the first father and son combination to have kept wicket for England
Australia have won the toss and will bowl. Clarke says: "I can't believe I'm saying this, but we'll bowl. The overhead conditions are good."
Cook: "It looks a good wicket, it might do something but most Test wickets do. It's such a big occasion, you don't need to lift the players."
Cook confirms that Jonny Bairstow replaces Matt Prior. Panesar comes in for Swann. Broad is fit. Australia are unchanged.
10.00am Looks as though that shower has moved away in time for the toss which is due any moment. Could be a tricky decision. Conditions suggest some movement this morning. Remember what happened in 2010-11...
Gabbagod: "For those that haven't been to a Boxing Day at the G, strap yourselves in for 7 hours of extreme cricket. It is THE day for cricket in the World." That's a decent build-up...no pressure then
9.50am A shower passing over the ground and the pitch is being covered. Just spotted Greg Matthews working with Monty Panesar in the middle. Sounds like we'll get an unchanged Australian team.
Kritesh: "England should go with Rankin. The Ashes is already lost. There is no harm in giving a few new players a go."
As we wait for the toss, why not our special edition of #PoliteEnquiries with Ian Bell a watch
9.40am Stuart Broad is working alongside James Anderson and Tim Bresnan which suggests he may be fit to play. We'll know for certain in 20 minutes. Meanwhile, did anyone get any weird Christmas presents?
Ryan Thomas: "Instead of considering dropping Prior why not just relieve him from the pressure of vice-captaincy? His poor run of form coincides with promotion." It's an idea, but sounds like he's been dumped.
Masses of people flocking into the G at the moment. Expectations of a record crowd today in excess of 90,000. The atmosphere should be fantastic. A continuation of the Australian celebrations, how can England respond? There will be a large contingent of their supporters who will want to make plenty of noise.
9.30am Hello everyone, Merry Christmas and season's greetings. Trust you are all suitably stuffed with food and ready to settle down for the Boxing Day Test. I'm Andrew McGlashan and along with Alan Gardner will be bringing you all the action over the next five days.
The early news from the ground is that it's a muggy morning and there have been a few spots of rain but it's dry at the moment. Monty Panesar has been applauded in the team huddle this morning which confirms his 50th Test cap as England begin life without Graeme Swann. No news on Prior/Bairstow just yet, but here's George Dobell on England's rebuilding task. It's been a busy few days for cricket retirements, with Jacques Kallis quitting Tests yesterday. Was quite a surprising decision and here's Firdose Moonda all about it.
 Innings Start
11.15am: Australia's last pair added a useful 40 runs in less than nine overs, England seeming to bowl too short - though it was a bumper that removed the barnacle-like Haddin in the end. Bill Lawry, guesting on Sky's commentary, reckons this will be the best day to bat on, a quicker pitch and outfield, so England have an opportunity in front of them. Alastair Cook will have to go upstairs and get his head straight, try and ensure his batsmen capitalise on the bowlers' sterling efforts.
82.2;W;Anderson to Haddin, OUT that will do it! Dug in and chasing Haddin as he backs away, cramping an attempted pull and the ball loops off the top edge, possibly via the helmet, Bairstow jogs to backward square leg to take a comfortable catch - his fourth of the innings - and England, despite a few flutters, have wrapped up the innings with a lead of 51;Brad Haddin c ?Bairstow b Anderson 65 (144m 68b 7x4 1x6) SR: 95.58;

81.1;4;Broad to Haddin, FOUR runs width outside off, comes quickly off the bat as Haddin slashes over the slips for four more... Australia landing useful blows now;
80.6;4;Anderson to Lyon, FOUR runs length delivery on the stumps this time and carted h-i-i-i-g-h over mid-on, real clout from Lyon and it drops a yard or two short of the rope before trickling for four;
80.5;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run banged in over the stumps, Lyon has walked across this time, throws the bat and misses again;
80.4;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run follows Lyon down the leg side with another bouncer, fractions away from missing the gloves trying to pull and Bairstow then makes a terrific diving take to prevent any byes;

77.6;?;Broad to Lyon, no run slightly short, coming back in and Lyon is hit on the thigh;
77.5;4;Broad to Lyon, FOUR runs another thick outside edge but this time over the head of point! Lyon hasn't been afraid to play his shots so far and there was enough on this to get him another boundary;

73.4;?;Broad to Lyon, no run slightly short of a length, angled in over the top of middle stump, tapped defensively to leg;
73.3;W;Broad to Siddle, OUT and another! Broad strikes again. Rather limp from Siddle as he drives early at a full delivery - been a tough pitch to drive on - and spoons to cover. What a day for England;Peter Siddle c Bresnan b Broad 0 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

70.6;?;Bresnan to Harris, no run good timing as he drives again, Bresnan just about has the energy to get himself down in the follow through and take some pace off the shot;
70.5;?;Bresnan to Harris, no run short of a length outside off, 124kph, punched to short cover;
70.4;?;Bresnan to Harris, no run full at middle and off, Harris is forward and drives to mid-on;

69.3;?;Broad to Harris, no run short of a length, pushed off the back foot to cover;
69.2;1;Broad to Haddin, 1 run hint of width, 133kph, Haddin chops it into the ground and point is deep enough to allow a single;

67.4;?;Panesar to Harris, no run quicker and flatter, 90kph, defended to the leg side;
67.3;4;Panesar to Harris, FOUR runs edged! And flies past slip. Wasn't a chance. It flew rapidly as he flashed off the back foot;

66.3;?;Bresnan to Harris, no run full at off stump, defended to the silly mid-off;
66.2;W;Bresnan to Johnson, OUT gone! This one is out for certain. And Anderson holds it. Johnson picks out midwicket with pull, he middle it well but it went straight, at knee height to Anderson who grabs it moving to his right. Relief for England;Mitchell Johnson c Anderson b Bresnan 2 (39m 30b 0x4 0x6) SR: 6.66;
66.1;1;Bresnan to Haddin, 1 run picks off another pull as Bresnan drops short, as usual it pings out of the middle to deep square;
65.6;?;Panesar to Johnson, no run touch short but he escapes as the back-foot drive is cracked to cover;
65.5;?;Panesar to Johnson, no run full outside off, hint of spin, Johnson leaves alone;

65.2;?;Panesar to Haddin, no run gets forward and defends;
65.1;?;Panesar to Haddin, no run Monty's done it! Or has he? Given lbw, but Haddin reviews. Slides into the pads, Haddin worked across the line. Doesn't appear to be an inside edge. It's heading towards leg, but you'd think clipping at worse. No edge for certain. Now he just need the tracker...it's missing! Oh boy, sliding past leg stump. Well, well. No spin for Monty;
64.6;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run full outside off again, lets it go through. Johnson showing patience;

62.5;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run defended to mid-off;
62.4;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run dropped, and it's Anderson again. A short cover. That's the plan they bowled for. It was full outside off, Johnson drove on the up but a fairly simple catch was shelled. On such things do matches swing;
62.3;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run well bowled, finds a thick outside edge as Johnson pushes at a full delivery but the edges runs along the ground to point;
62.2;?;Bresnan to Johnson, no run defended to point;

61.5;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run defends off a thick outer half of the bat to backward point;
61.4;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs now he gets inside the line and flicks it down to fine leg...three in the over;
61.3;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs this time he goes over mid-off, a terrific counter-attack from Haddin on a pitch that has been tricky to score on, it was a length ball and he just drove through the line on the up;
61.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run fuller and close to off stump, runs to backward point;
61.1;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs latches on again, just a hint of width and he cuts it backward of point...he can shift this game again in this last hour;
60.6;?;Stokes to Johnson, no run all defence again, this runs to mid-on;
60.5;?;Stokes to Johnson, no run left alone outside off;
60.4;?;Stokes to Johnson, no run on a length outside off, block firmly back down from whence it came;

58.3;?;Stokes to Johnson, no run full outside off, left alone;
58.2;3;Stokes to Haddin, 3 runs now he clips nicely through midwicket as Stokes gets too straight;
58.1;6;Stokes to Haddin, SIX runs that's a statement, stand and deliver over long-on with a wonderful clean strike against a full delivery. Haddin about to change gears?;
57.6;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run excellent delivery, in the channel and offering nothing, shaping away fractionally at 86.5mph, Johnson watches it calmly and leaves;
57.5;W;Anderson to Bailey, OUT offers him a bit of width now and Bailey throws the bat, England think there's a sound but Aleem Dar shakes his head. Cook asks for the review, those in the cordon did seem confident... so here we go: no visible nick, Hot Spot it pretty inconclusive; however, there's a faint noise as Billy Bowden rock-and-rolls the replay and, crucially, Real-Time Snicko is picking up a murmur, too. Yep, it's enough for Bowden and up goes the finger, the decision reversed and Australia are six wickets down!;George Bailey c ?Bairstow b Anderson 0 (38m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

56.4;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run pitched up on middle and off, Haddin gets his bat down and covers the line;

54.4;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run around the line of off, gets in line to block;
54.3;4;Stokes to Haddin, FOUR runs driving on the up and edged, flies thickly off the bat away behind point, Carberry diving in vain and Haddin picks up a boundary;
54.2;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run better length, Haddin gets forward and taps into the covers;
54.1;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run full and outside off, there to be driven but Haddin can't get the ball past mid-off;
53.6;?;Broad to Bailey, no run the ball is repeatedly homing back in at Bailey, this strikes him on the back pad and again Broad beseeches Aleem Dar for the lbw decision, there was a second sound, though, and replays show a clear inside edge. Cook wasn't interested in reviewing, anyway;
53.5;?;Broad to Bailey, no run fullish, stays in the crease and defends in front of off stump once more;
53.4;?;Broad to Bailey, no run attempted yorker from Broad, trying to sneak one through, Bailey gets his bat down on it;

53.2;?;Broad to Bailey, no run good length on the off stump, defended;
53.1;?;Broad to Bailey, no run attempted leave from Bailey nearly goes awry, he gets a toe end to second slip, on the bounce, then has to regain his ground as a speculative throw comes in;

52.1;W;Bresnan to Rogers, OUT oh my, what has Rogers done? A rare attacking stroke, he manages to slice it somewhat and Pietersen takes the catch running to his right from mid-off. England have another! He had been so patient, yet with a new partner at the other end, Rogers has tossed it away. Bresnan just kept plugging, the ball full and in the channel, Rogers wanted to loft down the ground and it possibly just stopped on him a little after hitting a footmark;Chris Rogers c Pietersen b Bresnan 61 (224m 171b 8x4 0x6) SR: 35.67;
51.6;?;Broad to Bailey, no run length ball on middle and off, more straight-batted defence from Bailey;
51.5;1;Broad to Rogers, 1 run pitched up again and wide of the stumps, drawing Rogers forward on to the drive, the ball squirts away from Carberry at point and they take a single;

49.6;?;Broad to Bailey, no run good length around the off stump and Bailey gets in line to defend his first ball;
49.5;W;Broad to Smith, OUT bit of width, Smith finally loses patience... and edges to second slip! England have bored Smith out, they dried up the runs and when the chance came, Bell clung on superbly well. The ball wasn't quite there to cut, slightly cramping Smith for room, it flew off the top edge and Bell seemed to lose it momentarily, only to readjust and snap up the catch;Steven Smith c Bell b Broad 19 (97m 77b 3x4 0x6) SR: 24.67;

48.5;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run Smith goes back and across and shows a length ball the maker's name;
48.4;?;Bresnan to Smith, no run over the wicket to Smith, defended outside off;
48.3;1;Bresnan to Rogers, 1 run crabs forward and across and manufactures the angle for a flick to leg, just wide of midwicket and they get one;
48.2;?;Bresnan to Rogers, no run wider still, Rogers has to reach for it, chops the ball towards gully this time;

46.1;?;Bresnan to Rogers, no run round the wicket, pitched up outside off and driven on the bounce to short extra cover;

Short spell from Anderson, with Tim Bresnan replacing him
 Innings Start
Lyon leads off the bowlers, holding the ball around the MCG. He'll work harder for fewer rewards, but a fantastic day for him. England's batting, part from Cook and Pietersen, has shocking. Australia need 231 to win and take a 4-0 lead. They'll have about 35 minutes of batting this evening. David Warner is unlikely to hold back. England have to take at least one scalp tonight, just to lift themselves after that display. Can someone do a Dean Headley? I'll be back in a few moments.
60.6;W;Johnson to Panesar, OUT stone dead! All over. Panesar opts to review as England have them left, but that was full, hint of late movement and it strikes him in front of off stump. Last five wickets have gone for six runs.;Monty Panesar lbw b Johnson 0 (7m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
60.5;?;Johnson to Panesar, no run bouncer over off stump, 143kph, and Monty is easily underneath it...showing some ticker;
60.4;?;Johnson to Panesar, no run on a length outside off, left alone;
60.3;?;Johnson to Panesar, no run defended from off stump;
60.2;?;Johnson to Panesar, no run full, going for the stumps, well dug out by Panesar;

59.5;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run defended back to the bowler;
59.4;W;Lyon to Pietersen, OUT five for Lyon! What an afternoon for him. Pietersen tries to clear the straight boundary but can only pick out long-off. He didn't really have much choice over how he had to play. England folding again.;Kevin Pietersen c Harris b Lyon 49 (158m 90b 6x4 0x6) SR: 54.44;
59.3;1;Lyon to Anderson, 1 run more flight, on leg stump and flicked towards short fine-leg;

58.6;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run tries to work a single into the off side but can't find a gap;
58.5;4;Johnson to Pietersen, FOUR runs he connects this time, held his position through the straight drive, it was a touch fuller and it races down the ground;
58.4;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run big swing to a full one outside off, that was in the stand if he connected...instead there was another gust of wind;
58.3;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run full again, Pietersen opens the face to try and find a gap but picks out point;
58.2;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run full outside off, hammered to mid-off;
58.1;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run what's happened here?! The bails are off. Australia going for hit wicket, but it's the wind that has blown the bails off. Pietersen just defended off the back foot then saw the Australians appealing.;
57.6;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run defended down in front of silly point;
57.5;W;Lyon to Broad, OUT 100 Test wickets! Donated, it has to be said, by Broad. Nicely flighted outside off, tempting the drive and Broad obliges with a belated Christmas present. The edge is safely held at slip. Some of England's shot selection today has bordered on brainless. Australia have applied pressure, yes, but they've been handed some gifts;Stuart Broad c Clarke b Lyon 0 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
57.4;?;Lyon to Broad, no run drifts down the leg side;
57.3;?;Lyon to Broad, no run finds the inside edge which scoots to short leg, a lot excited cries around the bat;
57.2;W;Lyon to Bresnan, OUT and another goes! Lyon bags his third. Bresnan going for the pull and gets a thin bottom edge onto the top of his stumps. He wasn't sure if Haddin and knocked the bails off so stood his ground, but didn't take long to confirm the news. Another poor shot. Wasteful from England.;Tim Bresnan b Lyon 0 (16m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
57.1;?;Lyon to Bresnan, no run full outside off, presses forward and defends;
56.6;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run here comes the tempter, full and a couple of feet wide of the stumps, Pietersen won't be playing at that;
56.5;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run half-tracker around off stump, gets on top of the bounce to defend;
56.4;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run Johnson continues to attack with short-pitched deliveries - there are two men out on the hook - but this is tapped down into the off side from back in the crease;

54.5;?;Johnson to Bresnan, no run fuller length, around the line of off, defended solidly into the covers;
54.4;?;Johnson to Bresnan, no run hit on the pads first ball, big appeal but must have pitched outside leg;
54.3;W;Johnson to Bairstow, OUT pitched up, wide of the stumps - and Bairstow is caught at the wicket driving! Another huge blow, wrenching the game back towards Australia. Bairstow absolutely didn't need to play at that, fishing at a full, fast delivery in the channel without moving his feet, might have been a half-volley in ordinary circumstances but this was 91mph and beat him for pace. Australia, licking their lips, are into the tail;Jonny Bairstow c ?Haddin b Johnson 21 (47m 28b 2x4 2x6) SR: 75;
54.2;?;Johnson to Bairstow, no run back of a length, zipping through just outside off, left alone;
54.1;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run the crowd works itself up for Mitch again, length ball on off stump and turned square on the leg side, Bairstow responds quickly and they take one more;
53.6;1;Harris to Pietersen, 1 run pitched up and Pietersen on-drives, calls immediately as the fielder goes to his left, there's a direct hit but no alarum;
53.5;2;Harris to Pietersen, 2 runs Harris goes short again, this time pulled in controlled fashion through square leg for a couple;
53.4;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run this does shape back in for Harris, defended with a straight bat in front of the wicket;

53.2;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run digs this in very short, flies through at head height, no stroke;

51.6;?;Harris to Bairstow, no run length ball around the line of off, comes forward to defend;
51.5;4;Harris to Bairstow, FOUR runs pokes at a slightly full delivery, the bat was angled towards midwicket, mid-on but the edge went fast and low through the cordon;
51.4;?;Harris to Bairstow, no run this one doesn't go off the straight as Bairstow leaves outside off;
51.3;?;Harris to Bairstow, no run fullish, tailing in - this raggedy old ball is reversing a touch - tapped into the covers;

50.2;6;Lyon to Bairstow, SIX runs floated up and here comes Bairstow again, there's a man out towards long-on but Bairstow clears him by a distance, plopping the ball into the crowd for another Dorothy;

49.6;4;Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs just a fraction overpitched and wide of off stump, Pietersen crashes the ball through the covers with regal disdain for another boundary;
49.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run on the stumps, stays back and defends;
49.4;4;Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs another half-tracker and this time pulled brutally off the front foot over midwicket, the kind of dismissive, wrecking ball stroke that Pietersen specialises in;

49.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run drags his length back, Pietersen blocks into the leg side;

48.6;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run gets forward to defend on the stumps;
48.5;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run fuller length and wider, there's spin as the ball goes through to Haddin, no stroke offered;
48.4;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run flighted on off stump, again gets in line;
48.3;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run leans out and pushes back to the bowler;
48.2;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run tossed up, driven with a flourish again and nearly takes out Pietersen, he's on his backside as Bairstow returns to his crease without reward;
48.1;6;Lyon to Bairstow, SIX runs gets a couple of strides in and bosh! Bairstow larrups the ball over long-on, that's how to hit the spinner down the ground. First scoring stroke, too;
47.6;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run on the stumps, length ball played on the up to mid-on;
47.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run full length on middle and leg, clipped down the ground towards mid-on again;
47.4;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run well-directed bouncer from Siddle, not hugely quick but right at the top of KP's block and he's hurried, drops the hands and pirouettes out of the way;
47.3;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run bit of width on offer, gets across and the hands flow through a cover drive, picks out a fielder;
47.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run full and straight, Pietersen comes forward and drives to mid-on;
47.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run fullish and played back to the bowler from in front of off stump;

46.5;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run on middle and off, leans out to defend;

45.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run pitched up, pushed back down the track;
45.4;2;Siddle to Pietersen, 2 runs leg-stump full toss from Siddle... and Pietersen so nearly slaps it to midwicket! Those two catchers are back and it was George Bailey who threw himself to his left, one-handed but just out of his reach. Pietersen lives;

45.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run comes forward and gets the full face on a drive into the covers;
45.1;4;Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs edged but it's short of second slip! Pietersen was drawn into playing away from his body, the nick went fast and low and flashed past Clarke, away for a boundary;
44.6;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run length ball, straightening around leg stump, tapped down into the ground and stopped by short leg;
44.5;W;Lyon to Stokes, OUT Stokes on the attack... but he's chipped straight to mid-off! England lose their fifth, the lead still less than 200, and Nathan Lyon wins a mini-battle for Stokes. He had mixed aggression and defence well until that moment but this dipped on him a little, maybe turned and the strike wasn't clean, picked out Smith - maybe halfway between mid- and long-off - and the 'G roared again;Ben Stokes c Smith b Lyon 19 (68m 55b 1x4 0x6) SR: 34.54;

43.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run menacing stride forward from Pietersen, slams an off-drive back past the bowler but not mid-off;
43.4;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run good length in the channel outside off, left alone;

43.2;3;Siddle to Pietersen, 3 runs slightly overpitched and drifting on to the pads, authoritative whip through midwicket from KP, not quite enough on it for a boundary but they pick up three;

42.3;?;Lyon to Pietersen, no run skips forwards and drives into the ground, Lyon fields on the bounce;
42.2;1;Lyon to Stokes, 1 run pushes the ball to Johnson and takes on the arm, another direct hit! Do not test Mitch... Stokes was home, however, showing good positive intent and Johnson was some way back at mid-on;
42.1;2;Lyon to Stokes, 2 runs length ball outside off, Stokes rocks back and cracks the ball through the covers for a couple;
41.6;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run angling back in off the seam, on a length and striking the knee roll, heading down leg though;
41.5;4;Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs width for Pietersen and he thrashes the first boundary in a while, the hands flowing through a powerful cut;

39.6;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run whipped away off leg stump down to long leg;
39.5;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run interesting, KP's feet didn't go anywhere and he felt for this very full delivery as though he didn't quite pick it up;

39.3;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run not as full this time, Pietersen on the crease and defends to mid-off;

39.1;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run full on middle, tailing in a little, flicked through midwicket;
38.6;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run always drama with KP...he defended this perfectly safely, Harris picked it up in his follow through and noticed Pietersen had strolled forward after the shot so hurled at the stumps and Pietersen ended up on his backside as he dived back;

38.4;?;Harris to Stokes, no run short of a length outside off, defended square to point from the back foot;

38.2;?;Harris to Stokes, no run solidly behind this one, defended to cover;
38.1;?;Harris to Stokes, no run beaten! That's a good one. Round the wicket, Stokes feels for it outside off stump as the ball comes in with the angle then holds its line;
37.6;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run close! It was the fuller delivery, Pietersen drives early, the bottom hand comes off the bat, and spoons the ball in the air but it's wide of Johnson and short of mid-on;
37.5;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run full on off stump, Pietersen a little caught on the crease and the ball takes a thick inside edge to the leg side;

37.3;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run back on off stump, defended on the front foot;
37.2;2lb;Johnson to Stokes, 2 leg byes fired down the leg side, been a couple of those today, this time Haddin gets a glove on it so it gives fine leg, Lyon, a chance to dive around the boundary and he does very well;

35.6;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run full on off stump, walks into a push-drive which goes to point;
35.5;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run gone with hit! Pietersen didn't have a hope. Stokes pushed to the off side and set off straight away, Siddle had a great bounce coming round from mid-off but his throw was off-target;
35.4;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run played out to cover;
35.3;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run keeping it full, giving it a chance to swing, Stokes defends on the front foot;
35.2;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run full at off stump, 143kph, hint of movement into Stokes - like with the Cook wicket - and he defends;
35.1;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run full outside off, left alone;
34.6;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run tight defence from Pietersen and the ball runs to cover;
34.5;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run defended to the covers;

34.3;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run pulls his length back, defended;
34.2;2;Harris to Pietersen, 2 runs square drive this time, the delivery was a little wider, didn't quite come out of the middle and gets comfortably chased down;

33.6;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run outside off, left alone, probing stuff from Siddle;
33.5;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run full outside off, his feet get a little stuck this time as he drives;
33.4;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run fuller and defended;
33.3;4;Siddle to Stokes, FOUR runs aggression from Stokes as he pulls a shorter delivery through midwicket, wasn't timed perfectly but had enough to reach the boundary;
33.2;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run blimey, he's left a straight ball but is saved by the bounce as he travels over middle stump...almost another batsman bowled in that fashion. Would have been like Rohit Sharma;
33.1;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run full on off stump, driven into the covers and the bat skews in his hand;
32.6;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run sharp spin this time, spins past the edge and takes Stokes high on the back leg;
32.5;2;Lyon to Stokes, 2 runs neat placement from Stokes as he stretches forward and drives this through the off side;
32.4;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run full and driven to mid-off;
32.3;1;Lyon to Pietersen, 1 run danger of a leading edge as he tries to turn this from outside off through the leg side, but it runs along the ground to mid-off where Johnson is deeper this time compared to the Root dismissal;
32.2;?;Lyon to Pietersen, no run uses his feet then opts to defend to midwicket as Lyon drags his length back;
32.1;?;Lyon to Pietersen, no run pushed across outside off from round the wicket, driven to extra cover;

31.4;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run defended to the covers;
31.3;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run another one across the left hander, leaves it alone;
31.2;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run wider outside off, left alone;
31.1;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run back of a length at off stump, defended to the on side;
30.6;4;Lyon to Pietersen, FOUR runs some relief for England as Pietersen picks off a straight drive as Lyon pitches this a fraction too full;
30.5;1;Lyon to Stokes, 1 run fuller this time, flicked towards mid-on who is deep enough to allow a single;
30.4;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run nice drift from round the wicket, defended to cover;
30.3;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run takes a think inside edge, into the ground and towards short leg;
30.2;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run pushed back to the bowler;
30.1;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run full on off stump, forward and defends;
29.6;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run defended to midwicket;

28.6;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run blocked to the off side;
28.5;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run gets forward on off stump and defends;
28.4;W;Lyon to Bell, OUT would you believe it?! Bell has just chipped to mid-off. The wheels are coming off again for England. Flighted on off stump, Bell had to reach for his drive and just spooned towards Johnson who appears to be everywhere at the moment. Awful dismissal. Australia could barely believe it;Ian Bell c Johnson b Lyon 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
28.3;1;Lyon to Pietersen, 1 run stays round the wicket, touch short, Pietersen whips it out to deep square;
28.2;W;Lyon to Root, OUT direct hit! That man Johnson! Root has gone. Pushed towards mid-off, Johnson was quickly to his left and hit the stumps as Root dived in vain for his ground. Well short. The umpire nodded before double checking with TV;Joe Root run out (Johnson) 15 (37m 24b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.5;
28.1;?;Lyon to Root, no run defended to short leg;
27.6;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run a beauty from Siddle first up, seaming back at Pietersen, beats him on the inside and thumps the back thigh pad;
27.5;W;Siddle to Carberry, OUT round the wicket to Carberry, hit on the pads and given! Siddle ends a tortuous innings from Carberry, good use of the angle and the delivery seemed to beat him for pace, he had shuffled across and the ball ducked back at him. Root and Carberry had a chat about reviewing until Dharmasena told them time was up but Hawk-Eye suggests it would have stayed as umpire's call, the ball just clipping leg stump;Michael Carberry lbw b Siddle 12 (122m 81b 1x4 0x6) SR: 14.81;
27.4;1;Siddle to Root, 1 run Siddle goes full and much straighter, neatly whipped off his toes for a single to deep backward square;
27.3;?;Siddle to Root, no run gets on the front foot outside off and shoulders arms again;

26.2;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run full and drifting towards leg stump, defended;
26.1;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run skidding on with the arm just outside off, Carberry chops in hurried fashion off the back foot, can't get it away;
25.6;2;Siddle to Root, 2 runs wide of the stumps, Root drops back and steers the ball down to third man;
25.5;?;Siddle to Root, no run touch shorter, in the channel and dabbed off the back foot in front of square;
25.4;?;Siddle to Root, no run goes back and across and shoulders arms;
25.3;?;Siddle to Root, no run Siddle pops this on a length outside off again, no stroke offered this time;
25.2;?;Siddle to Root, no run length outside off, played with soft hands and a outside edge runs low to second slip;
25.1;1;Siddle to Carberry, 1 run tip and run into the off side again, might have been in trouble but the pick up isn't clean;
24.6;?;Lyon to Root, no run pushed through on the stumps, played from deep in the crease, keeps the ball out;
24.5;?;Lyon to Root, no run floated up around middle and off, leans on another forward defensive;

24.3;?;Lyon to Root, no run comes forward around off stump to defend;
24.2;2;Lyon to Root, 2 runs tossed up outside the line of off, gets on the front foot and drives along the ground through cover for a couple;
24.1;?;Lyon to Root, no run round the wicket, tossed up towards off stump, opens the face and steers to backward point;
23.6;1;Johnson to Root, 1 run digs the ball in, Root rides the bounce and taps past short leg for another single;
23.5;1;Johnson to Carberry, 1 run better from Carberry, dabbing a defensive push into the covers and they comfortably steal one more;
23.4;3;Johnson to Root, 3 runs goes full and a touch wide and Root fillets a drive through the covers, nicely timed for three;
23.3;?;Johnson to Root, no run Johnson's pace isn't quite as threatening, 88-89mph/141-143kph at the moment, though this still climbs steeply as Root blocks on the back foot;
23.2;?;Johnson to Root, no run straight line, stays back and defends in front oft he stumps;
23.1;1;Johnson to Carberry, 1 run pitched up on the stumps, again shaping back in, squeezed out on the leg side - Carberry is into double figures, folks;
22.6;3;Lyon to Carberry, 3 runs uses the feet this time and gets the ball away through midwicket with a solid push past Watson, who jogs gingerly after it;

21.6;?;Johnson to Root, no run thunders in, good length on the stumps, Root blocks to leg from back in the crease;
21.5;?;Johnson to Root, no run past the bat, Haddin goes up, so does Johnson... and Dar's finger! Root looks perplexed, shaking his head, consulting Carberry and this time there will be a review. It was slightly full, a teasing line and Root played instinctively at it, trying to stop himself at the last second. Did he manage it? Replays don't show a visible edge, nothing on Hot Spot either... and Real-Time Snicko present a clean bill, too. So this will be overturned. Root was bamboozled in Perth when he thought he hadn't hit it but failed the DRS test; this time he gets a reprieve;
21.4;?;Johnson to Root, no run pitched up and sliding across outside off, leaves this one alone;
21.3;W;Johnson to Cook, OUT appreciable reverse swing for Johnson and that's trapped Cook in front! Thinks about the review but doesn't find much support from his partner, so off he goes. It was a good delivery, homing back at Cook and past the inside edge, struck on the knee roll, would have hit middle and leg. Never mind Cook looking fluent - Johnson does it again;Alastair Cook lbw b Johnson 51 (91m 64b 7x4 0x6) SR: 79.68;
21.2;?;Johnson to Cook, no run on the stumps, turns the ball into the leg side;
21.1;?;Johnson to Cook, no run slips in the full-bunger instead, Cook spots it and drops the bat in time;

20.5;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run on the stumps, Carberry stays back and again taps to mid-on;
20.4;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run stands upright and pushes to mid-on;
20.3;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run ouch, Carberry lands a full-blooded mow on George Bailey at short leg! He went down on one knee and creamed it straight at the fielder's left hand, although the fleshy part (which is also the tastiest) took most of the impact;
20.2;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run tossed up on the stumps and Carberry leans out to defend;
20.1;1;Lyon to Cook, 1 run tossed up, worked behind square on the leg side for a single;

19.5;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run banged in short and outside off, ducks it;
19.4;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run big appeal, Carberry struck on the pads by a rapid yorker... but there was an inside edge and Aleem Dar knew it;
19.3;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run slightly short and again far enough outside off for Carberry to ignore;
19.2;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run well outside off, the batsman goes back to leaving;
19.1;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run ooh, careful now, perhaps his slow scoring rate is beginning to nag, Carberry flailing wildly at an attempted hook and missing;
18.6;4;Watson to Cook, FOUR runs just a little width again and Cook slashes the ball through backward point for four more - that's fifty for Cook, who has looked about as serene as he has done since the start of the Mega Ashes back in July;
18.5;?;Watson to Cook, no run tight stuff from Watto, again Cook defends;
18.4;?;Watson to Cook, no run gets on the front foot and waves a length ball through;
18.3;4;Watson to Cook, FOUR runs bit of width and Cook demonstrates fast hands and good intent, back-cutting the ball powerfully past backward point for a retaliatory boundary;
18.2;?;Watson to Cook, no run angled across and Cook plays forward, there's a low snick that again bobbles short of Clarke in the slips;
18.1;?;Watson to Cook, no run on the stumps, comes forward and defends back to the bowler;
17.6;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run there's that slightly sketchy leave from Carberry again, tries to take the bat out of the way late and a toe end deflects along the ground to slip;
17.5;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run slung down wide of the wicket, nothing doing from Carberry;
17.4;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run length delivery in the channel outside off, Carberry happy to watch those through;
17.3;1;Johnson to Cook, 1 run not quite chin music, more like Adam's apple, nudged to backward square for another single;
17.2;?;Johnson to Cook, no run steams through outside off, short of a length and Cook allows it through;

16.1;?;Watson to Cook, no run full and floated up wide of the stumps, Cook lets it through;
15.6;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run back over the wicket for the last ball, short of a length outside off and it's left alone;
15.5;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run back to bouncer mode, this angles across Carberry as he sways out of the line;
15.4;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run pushed across full outside off, the double bluff, and he leaves it alone;
15.3;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run short over leg stump, Carberry ducks;
15.2;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run full at off stump, hint of late movement, driven firmly to mid-off;
15.1;1;Johnson to Cook, 1 run greeted with a handsome pull by Cook, that made a great sound off the bat, goes straight to deep square leg;
14.6;?;Watson to Carberry, no run defends towards point...still a battle for Carberry;
14.5;?;Watson to Carberry, no run edged! Doesn't carry to second slip. This time Carberry went for the drive, it was a healthy nick but fell in front of Clarke...Watson's lack of pace helped that not carry;
14.4;?;Watson to Carberry, no run left alone;

 Innings Start
3pm: In England, it's 4am and all's not well. There will be much to discuss after this latest horror show, calls for changes at the SCG as the #pomnishambles moves to its final stop on the tour. For now, I give you Dan Brettig's report, which includes the word "hapless" in the headline, and a link to the Ashes banter zone, which should be red hot right now, such has been England's prodigious comedy output. Gnasher and I are done for this Test - in fact, my series is over, the young blood of Alex Winter coming in for Sydney - so we bid you adieu. Thanks for the comments, as ever, they give us a second wind in the field. This has been (and still will be for 10 days) Ashes2Ashes and you've been wonderful. Ta ra
2.45pm: Right, time for the presentations... First up, England captain, Alastair Cook: "It's difficult to take, we got ourselves in the position to win it, probably shows the state of the side, when you're winning games you know how to close it out, when you're losing you don't. In the first half hour [this morning] we created three chances but we didn't take them and when you don't, in a small chase, it runs away from you. We're working as hard as we normally do. When you're a winning side and a settled side it's easy but we can't use that as an excuse. [Panesar?] We wanted to get the ball to reverse, so we bowled with the seamers, trying to rough up the ball. If it comes off it comes off, other people might have done it differently. We got ourselves in a position to win this game so we've got to dust ourselves off for Sydney. We thank our supporters, it's a privilege to wear this shirt, but we're not quite doing it justice at the minute."
It's a toss up between Rogers and Mitchell Johnson for Man of the Match but Mitch wins it for blowing England's tail away with five wickets in the first innings, not to mention a run-out and three wickets in the second: "I thought Chris did really well, so maybe he should be man of the match. Yeah, we got the ball to shape, there was reverse as well out there, so it was really enjoyable. The run-out just bounced nicely and I managed to hit. There's a lot of people who've helped me, my team-mates have been behind me, so thanks to them. I think that's the first time I've bowled on Boxing Day, in front of 91,000, so quite an experience."
Finally, victorious Australia captain, Michael Clarke, who is asked by Mark Nicholas if he envisioned this before the series: "Probably not, I certainly had faith in the guys to win the series but to be 4-0 up, it's amazing. I think it shows the confidence of the guys, to have the freedom to come out and play as we have, we weren't taking as many runs or wickets as we wanted but guys have turned it around. I think the risk of bowling first is always the same, if you win you get away with it, if you lose you cop a lot of criticism. I think if there's anything in the wicket for our bowlers I was confident that could do the job and they did. We always try to work out how we can improve session to session. [Haddin?] The old boy is doing it every single time he goes out to bat and with the gloves. He's been great for NSW and when he was out of the side, all he wanted was to get back in the Australian team. We're going to try, our goal is to win 5-0, if the crowd come and support us as they have, it gives us a second wind in the field, so there's no reason why not."
2.35pm: Shane Watson and Ryan Harris have also been collared by members of the Channel Nine team. I'm assuming the official presentations will be made soon... Now Brad Haddin is having a chat to Ian Healy, as Melburnians loll in the sunshine behind him.
Anyway, this has been a real sucker punch for England to deal with, their fans in particular after the (premature) euphoria of day two. Michael Clarke took a gamble by inserting England and then his team dragged the match around, with England 0-65 in their second innings, 116 ahead with all ten wickets standing. There was a flavour of Adelaide 2006 about the way they froze, seemingly unable to compute being in a dominant position; from the moment they lost 5 for 6 at the end of the innings yesterday evening, this result seemed likely. Two missed chances in the first six overs this morning then sealed the deal.
2.30pm: Australia are romping towards 5-0, a scoreline that some were predicting in reverse a few months ago... Oh, look Chris Rogers is being interviewed on the MCG outfield already: "Yeah, doesn't get better than this, to win a Boxing Day Test and get a hundred on the last day, stuff dreams are made of. We were behind the game, quite worried. We knew if we hung in there, knocked the tail over, we could come out and then the batsman did fantastically. The bowlers have been great all series, so all credit to them. It's amazing, to get a hundred at the MCG, it's my home now, the crowd were amazing, so I thank them very much. It doesn't get any better. We're hoping we can do it [the whitewash], we're playing so well, the goal is to create history."
51.5;2;Panesar to Watson, 2 runs on the stumps, whipped in front of square leg and that will scuttle away, Watson runs with his bat raised in the air, a big grin on his face.

34.4;?;Stokes to Rogers, no run gasps from the crowd as Rogers inside-edges on to his pads, where the ball gets stuck behind the flap, he then wonders where it has gone and as he swivels to look for it, arms outstretched, the ball pops out and just misses the stumps.
