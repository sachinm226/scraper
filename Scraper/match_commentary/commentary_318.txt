Sri Lanka have an excellent chance of levelling this series now. Australia have been bowled out for a sub-par score, even on a track and in conditions that have favoured bowlers a bit more. Haddin's done a good job but his side has been bowled out with 19 balls to spare in the first innings. A collective bowling display from the visitors. Join us at around 6.30pm for the chase. Daniel Brettig's updated report will be ready shortly.
