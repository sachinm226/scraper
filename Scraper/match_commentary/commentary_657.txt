Data
15:54 local, 05:54 GMT There's a tinge of green on the surface. The Australians are preparing to come out. The lights are on. But it looks good enough for play. Australia in a huddle. Mitchell Johnson's Test debut. The Sri Lankan openers are coming out next. After ages its Marvan Atapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya, 36 and 38 respectively. Experienced campaigners. Atapattu hasn't played a Test for some two years and will face Brett Lee. Three slips, gully, point, cover, and bat-pad.
15:48 local, 05:48 GMT And with that a frustrated Ponting declares on 551 for 4. He wanted to know that if he declared in ten minutes' time, would the batsmen get the light. The umpires couldn't answer that at the moment and so Ponting calls in his batsmen.
A huge score for the hosts at their fortress, the Gabba, thanks to hundred from Phil Jaques and the two Micheals, Hussey and Clarke, plus fifties to the captain and Andrew Symonds. Australia now have a little over an hour, light permitting, to bowl at Sri Lanka.
Go get a drink, snack or whatever you please but come back because we will resume shortly. I'll be back in a couple minutes myself.

 Innings Start
Lee finishes off the innings with a burst of wickets. Sri Lanka are still 340 runs behind Australia, and Ponting will enforce the follow on. It shouldn't be long before they come back out. A brief roll of the pitch will be done during the interval. Don't go anyway, I'll be back in a few.

 Innings Start
Clark gets two, Lee finishes with four to make it eight in the match, and the home side walk off with another win at their fortress, the Gabba. Smiles, hugs, back-slaps and hi-fives all around as the small Brisbane crowd claps Australia off the field.
Just to recap for you, Sri Lanka won the toss, elected to field, and let Australia get up to 551 for 4, with hundreds to Jaques, Hussey and Clarke. Then they struggled, bowled out for 211 and following-on, being dismissed for 300. Not a lot to speak about with the bat, bar a battling first-innings half-century from Atapattu, back in the Test XI after two years and censured for his comments about the national selectors, a couple of aggressive 40s from Silva, and Vandort's well-composed 82 in the second innings, which denied Australia on day four. Sri Lanka's bowlers had a bad time too.
Mahela Jayawardene doesn't rue bowling first, but credits the Australian batting for putting up "a decent score". He says Sri Lanka lost the match with their batting on the third day. Hopes Sangakkara is fit for the second Test. Has no issues with Atapattu's "muppet" comments and hopes matters are sorted out behind closed doors. Wants to display Sri Lanka's talent here and is hopeful of a good game in Hobart. "It's disappointing ... hurtful to lose this Test by an innings."
Ponting says it was a frustrating win, having to toil on day four and deal with the weather delays. Australia haven't played a Test for ten months but this is their 13th consecutive win. Ponting likes coming to Brisbane and is very proud of Jaques, Johnson and MacGill. Feels Australia's new era is off to a good start and credits the preparation coming into this Test.
Lee picks up the Man-of-the-Match award for his 8 for 112 in the match.
Well, folks, its been a pleasure bringing you the commentary of this Test.
