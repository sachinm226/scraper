Ram: "Not a good decision, should have informed Rohit and Pant when 20 overs left or after 400" Bharat: "My guess - Bumrah and Ishant will bowl 3 overs each and Jadeja will bowl the last one!" Andrew: "Aggressive declaration by India, given that they only need to draw the series to retain the Border-Gavaskar trophy... Tipping Australia to make 700 in two days and then skittle India for 200 on day 5!" Daniel: "Being out in the field for that long will be a good character building exercise for some of the inexperienced Australian players. Hopefully the likes of Harris & Head have learnt that keeping the opposition in the field is a good tactic to tire them out, not just trying to freely score runs." Brodie Elliott: "As an Aussie.... I am feeling extremely nervous!" 5:27pm India have declared. That should give them seven overs at Australia. The acceleration coming a little late in the day, but they seem to have calculated this. Teams who bat 170 overs and have wickets in hand usually have a good idea exactly where they want to be, and India have deemed 443 is good enough for this pitch. The players will be back on the field in a couple of minutes.

168.4;4;Starc to Pant, FOUR runs boom! Wow! Cannot hit it harder than that, surely.

125.4;W;Cummins to Pujara, OUT keeps low and that's the end of Pujara. Ah, that's awful. Pujara can't believe it. Hardly did anything wrong there. Hanging back to a short of a length delivery, barely gets up and goes through the defences to take out the stumps. As with most great stands, one partner follows the other soon after it's broken;Cheteshwar Pujara b Cummins 106 (481m 319b 10x4 0x6) SR: 33.22;

 Innings Start
No-11 Hazlewood
66.5;W;Bumrah to Hazlewood, OUT Make it six wickets for Bumrah. After shaking up Hazlewood with a brace of short balls, Bumrah slips in the full inswinger. Hazlewood backs away outside leg, Bumrah chases the moving batsman. Hazlewood gets a thick inside edge that disturbs the off stump;Josh Hazlewood b Bumrah 0 (4m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
66.4;?;Bumrah to Hazlewood, no run Hazlewood steps outside leg again, this is shorter and faster, thudding past him to the keeper;
66.3;?;Bumrah to Hazlewood, no run banged in short and outside off, Hazlewood backs away and fends it off to the cordon;
66.2;W;Bumrah to Lyon, OUT Bumrah claims a five-wicket haul! He follows the bouncer with a full rocket - 146.1ks - catches Lyon in the crease. He's beaten for pace, shuffling across and playing around his front pad in front of middle and leg. Lyon doesn't review, probably umpire's call. Yup, the tracker returns umpire's call on leg stump;Nathan Lyon lbw b Bumrah 0 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

64.4;?;Bumrah to Lyon, no run short on leg, ducks under it;
64.3;W;Bumrah to Paine, OUT Bumrah returns and finds the outside edge of Paine. Is that a clean catch from Pant to his right? Paine walks off. Replays suggest it's a clean catch. Pant throws himself to his right and gets his gloves underneath the ball. Nicely done. Good length, angling in towards off, and straightening away. Paine hangs back in the crease, dangles his bat out in the channel, and snicks it behind;Tim Paine c ?Pant b Bumrah 22 (115m 85b 1x4 0x6) SR: 25.88;
64.2;1;Bumrah to Starc, 1 run full inswinger, Starc jams his bat down and squeezes an inside edge square through the leg side;

62.2;?;Shami to Starc, no run big appeal for lbw. Turned down. And a big discussion between captain and keeper before they decide against the review. Inswinger, around the wicket. Hits him middle stump, probably going down;

61.1;?;Jadeja to Paine, no run full on off stump, driven back to the bowler;
60.6;W;Shami to Cummins, OUT top of off! Superb, superb over from Shami. Every ball he's looked like barging through the defences, and now he does. Dips in from just outside off, at a good length. Cummins hangs the bat inside the line, expecting a little more movement perhaps. Or he's just been done by a subtle change in line. Whatever it is, it's top class from Shami. India have the breakthrough;Pat Cummins b Mohammed Shami 17 (70m 48b 2x4 0x6) SR: 35.41;

32.6;W;Bumrah to Marsh, OUT oh he's got him with a stunning ball! Unbelievable control on the slower ball from Bumrah. They won't bother reviewing this lbw, he's been struck on the full, right in front of middle stump. World class from Bumrah. Quick-arm whippy action, Marsh has been dealing with those yorkers solidly so far, but he's early on this because he's rolled his fingers over it and got it to dip. Can't play that, it's just too good. Marsh can't believe it. He was looking good and seemed to have taken them to some sort of safety, only to be outdone by a moment of genius. He's dejected, but there's really no way to adjust when you're hurrying down to deal with a yorker and it ends up drifting in slowly. The perfect deception.;Shaun Marsh lbw b Bumrah 19 (81m 61b 1x4 0x6) SR: 31.14;

23.5;?;Jadeja to Head, no run full outside off, defended into the off side;
23.4;4;Jadeja to Head, FOUR runs past the keeper and given runs. Which is strange. Length ball turns in sharply from outside off, beats the outside edge and lifts over middle stump.

Monga from MCG: Does this wicket have a lot to do with the bLow on the head yesterday? Yesterday he took a blow when trying to avoid one. India stayed away from the hook even though they kept getting hit, but Harris goes for it with a man behind just for this. In the whole innings, India played just two two hook shots just because of the inconsistent bounce. Australia don't seem to have learnt from watching them bat
