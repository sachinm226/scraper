Welcome one and all to Cricinfo's coverage of this ODI between Ireland and Australia at the Clontarf CC in Dublin. The ground is near a Castle which was built in 1837 and is now a popular hotel. We'll have news of the teams and the toss shortly. The weather is overcast and Australia have won the toss and elected to bat.
 Innings Start
It was nearly a memorable win for Ireland - had they kept their cool in the middle order they would have got there with plenty of overs to spare. Man of the Match goes to James Hopes for his 5/14 off 9 overs - well deserved. Stay tuned for plenty of live coverage on Cricinfo over the coming days with the 2nd Test between West Indies and South Africa, plus the Asia Cup matches and the England Australia series which starts next week. Nighty, night from Clontarf CC in beautiful Dublin
