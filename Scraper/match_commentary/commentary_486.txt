The team lists are below. I'm desperate for a cup of coffee. We have around 15 minutes left for the start. If you can, grab a cup for me too.
It was quite outrageous for Chris Gayle to declare a 4-1 win with his team already under-strength. It will be something if they actually pull it off, but I doubt if Gayle actually saw Australia steamroll Pakistan.
Here's a comment from a 'West Indies supporter': Stop using the term under-strength team in reference to the WI. Our line up is equal to any team in the world. Once the guys are focus we will defeat Aust. 4-1. If we are focued on the task at hand we will defeat them. "
Alex: "I am a believer in positive attitude- i am confident the captain- gayle can motivate his team...if the players do not believe in themselves--who will...so, i truly believe windies has past the curve to recoupe winning days, months,years..GO WINDIES!"
Gopinath: "I wonder why Gayle is going with only three main bowers , Australia has such a good batting line up.May be that's the reason he opted to field because he relies on his batting he can chase 300 plus , but cant defend 300 plus.."
1.55pm: Good morning wherever you are and welcome to the coverage of the first ODI between Australia and West Indies at the MCG. The toss is about five minutes away.
2pm: Toss: West Indies have won the toss and Australia have been asked to bat first. The teams will be up shortly.

Two changes from the Perth ODI against Pakistan - Voges and Clint McKay make way for Watson and Bollinger. Clarke also returns. Clarke and Watson played the T20 against Pakistan.
West Indies: 1 Chris Gayle (capt), 2 Runako Morton, 3 Travis Dowlin, 4 Lendl Simmons, 5 Narsingh Deonarine, 6 Kieron Pollard, 7 Dwayne Smith, 8 Denesh Ramdin (wk), 9 Nikita Miller, 10 Ravi Rampaul, 11 Kemar Roach.
 Innings Start
Well, that was clinical from Australia, the bowling looked particularly good, especially with the new ball. The absence of the likes of Lee, Bracken and Siddle is hardly being felt, West Indies being rolled over for 143. Kieron Pollard showed us a glimpse of his all-round skills, and West Indies' spinners did a decent job but there was little else to hearten the visitors.
That's it from us at Cricinfo for today, thanks for all the mails, join us again on Tuesday to see how the second ODI in Adelaide turns out.

1.5;2;Harris to Morton, 2 runs length ball outside off, Morton jabs at it and guides it past slip and towards third man;
1.4;?;Harris to Morton, no run back of a length and outside off, Morton gets nicely forward and defends, that ball was 144kmh;
1.3;?;Harris to Morton, no run shaping into the batsman, length delivery, 148kmh, punched towards mid-on;
1.2;?;Harris to Morton, no run much more solid this time, shows the full face of the bat as he defends back towards the bowler;
1.1;?;Harris to Morton, no run Morton plays his third unconvincing shot, he's slow on his stroke and inside-edges the ball onto his boot;
0.6;4;Bollinger to Gayle, FOUR runs again Bollinger digs it in, another flat bat swipe from Gayle, bottom-edges it just wide of a diving Haddin to the fine leg boundary;
0.5;2;Bollinger to Gayle, 2 runs this time the short ball is on legstump, Gayle lifts his front leg as he helps the ball just over Shaun Marsh at square leg, the sun was in Marsh's eyes which might have saved Gayle;
0.4;?;Bollinger to Gayle, no run short ball, Gayle takes a big swish at it, eyeing the midwicket boundary, but doesn't connect;
0.3;1;Bollinger to Morton, 1 run Morton again defends unconvincingly, another inside edge, the ball rolls towards the off side, Gayle was haring through for the single and was nearly at the striker's end when Morton responds;
0.2;?;Bollinger to Morton, no run nearly a wicket there, Morton gets an inside edge and the ball bounces just in front of the stumps and sails over;
0.1;1;Bollinger to Gayle, 1 run shortish and into the ribs, Gayle swats that down to fine leg, great timing, nearly through to the fielder in the deep, lands a few yards short of him though;
0.1;1w;Bollinger to Gayle, 1 wide starts with a 134kmh bouncer, too high for the umpire's liking;
