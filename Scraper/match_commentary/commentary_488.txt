So Southee and Vettori combine to skittle out Australia for 231 after losing the toss. Australia will look back at the innings with a lot of regret because some of their main batters threw it away - Watson, Ponting, Clarke and to a lesser extent, Katich. Having said that, the bowlers were consistent and kept the pressure on and didn't let any big partnerships develop. The catching was fine and fielding sharp. Good stuff from the home side.
Li Rui writes from China: "Love the balance 2 spinners gives NZ, but fringe guys like Patel or Arnel could enhance their worth with some batting work a la Vettori or Franklin. Great to see Southee playing: like Hilfenhaus, give him some experience and he'll be a handful in the right conditions."

 Innings Start
3.30pm Australia will be elated with what has happened today, and New Zealand will be kicking themselves. Despite three dropped catches, and a Ross Taylor blinder - the fastest century by a New Zealander - they lead Australia's 231 by just 33 runs. They have taken early tea, join us in 20 minutes

63.2;?;Harris to Martin, no run angling into pads, fails to get bat on ball;
63.1;1;Harris to Southee, 1 run Southee gets an inside edge onto pad and he is looking for two but Harris is quick to run towards midwicket and keep them down to one;
62.6;W;Johnson to Arnel, OUT Johnson finally gets his way, it pitches around off, Arnell hangs his bat to this one, and the angle takes the edge, end of an important little partnership;Brent Arnel c ?Haddin b Johnson 7 (20m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.88;
62.5;?;Johnson to Arnel, no run this is better from Johnson, short and into the ribs, hits him in the glove but that hand is off the bat, and it doesn't carry anyway;
62.4;2;Johnson to Arnel, 2 runs this is an even better shot from Arnell than the boundary in the last over, gets the front close to the line, and push-drives through covers;
62.3;1;Johnson to Southee, 1 run short outside off, and he bunts into covers and runs;
62.2;?;Johnson to Southee, no run slower ball, 133ks, is beaten outside off, the edge wouldn't have carried if he had managed one here;
62.1;6;Johnson to Southee, SIX runs whoa, Southee proving those defensive fields right! 15 rows back over long leg, clears the front leg, Johnson sends in a bouncer and he swings and connects;
61.6;4;Bollinger to Arnel, FOUR runs flayed through covers, full and wide and he lets it rip and finds the gap this time, clean strike;
61.5;?;Bollinger to Arnel, no run this is a better short delivery, aimed at ribs, but at 137ks, not that quick, he gets behind it well;

60.5;4;Johnson to Southee, FOUR runs long-on has come to a three-fourths position after that earlier miss, and Southee has driven this length ball powerfully enough to beat him;
60.4;?;Johnson to Southee, no run angled across him, and he is beaten as he looks to push it to cover;
60.3;2;Johnson to Southee, 2 runs and Southee looks to clear them, that takes some thinking, short ball and he toe-ends the pull, which lands short of all leg-side fielders;

60.1;1;Johnson to Southee, 1 run full outside off, and Southee again takes the easy single;

58.2;?;Johnson to Southee, no run Southee is going for it, pulls and misses;
58.1;4;Johnson to Southee, FOUR runs whipped away off the pads, and more clumsy fielding from Bollinger at fine leg, he comes around, bends slowly, pulls it in, and then kicks it over - he didn't intend to do so, mind you;
57.6;W;Bollinger to Taylor, OUT review, Taylor goes for the boundary with the field up, goes for the pull shot, the ball is too full, Aussies appeal for a bottom edge, Asad Rauf doesn't move. Hot spot shows a faint tickle as the ball passes the bat, and Rauf overturns his decision;Ross Taylor c ?Haddin b Bollinger 138 (180m 104b 19x4 4x6) SR: 132.69;
57.5;1;Bollinger to Southee, 1 run pitched up on the pads, Southee plays the shot too early, and the leading edge falls wide of the widish mid-off;

57.1;?;Bollinger to Taylor, no run angled across him, and Taylor leaves it be;
56.6;W;Johnson to Patel, OUT and that's the problem with tailenders when they get confident, they play shots they shouldn't, as Patel goes chasing this wide delivery without moving his feet and Ponting takes a nice catch to his right at second slip;Jeetan Patel c Ponting b Johnson 7 (32m 25b 1x4 0x6) SR: 28;
56.5;?;Johnson to Patel, no run full and across him, and hit powerfully to point, Patel getting confident here;
56.4;1;Johnson to Taylor, 1 run short, outside off, and places it wide of point;
56.3;2;Johnson to Taylor, 2 runs low full toss, he has hit it hard, and more importantly placed it between deep point and sweeper cover, North makes a diving save;
56.2;?;Johnson to Taylor, no run full ball outside off, defended;
56.1;4;Johnson to Taylor, FOUR runs exploits the strong off-side field and the round-the-wicket angle as he clips this one from outside off the fine-leg boundary;
55.6;?;Bollinger to Patel, no run full delivery, driven to the widish mid-off in place;
55.5;4;Bollinger to Patel, FOUR runs Patel gets into action here, short and wide all right, but he gets on top of the bounce and caresses it past gully;

54.3;?;Johnson to Patel, no run short, into the thigh pad, beats him for pace;
54.2;?;Johnson to Patel, no run bouncer outside off, easy to duck under it;
54.1;?;Johnson to Patel, no run short outside off, pushed to gully;
53.6;6;Hauritz to Taylor, SIX runs bye bye ball, this was a one-day wide outside off had he not played it, and he had slog-swept it over cow corner, gluttony from Taylor;
53.5;6;Hauritz to Taylor, SIX runs Taylor is on fire here, and this ground is too small, Hauritz - brave man - flights it again, and gets it in Taylor's arc, and watches it sail over long-on;
53.4;6;Hauritz to Taylor, SIX runs what a strike, slog-swept from way outside off, and Watson has no chance of catching this, they have lost the ball behind midwicket, big six;
53.3;1;Hauritz to Patel, 1 run worked around the corner for one;
53.2;1;Hauritz to Taylor, 1 run Watson is brilliant at deep midwicket, and gets a generous applause too... slog-swept, Watson takes the catch at the edge of the boundary, to his right, and it is very difficult to keep his balance as both feet are in the air when he catches it, but before falling over he throws the ball back in play;
53.2;5nb;Hauritz to Taylor, (no ball) FOUR runs half-volley wide outside off, and Taylor smacks it over mid-off, clean, one bounce into the fence, and he has over-stepped too;

52.1;?;Johnson to Taylor, no run crisp cover-drive, straight to extra cover;

51.5;?;Hauritz to Patel, no run comes forward to defend;
51.4;?;Hauritz to Patel, no run wide outside off, leaves it alone;
51.3;?;Hauritz to Patel, no run looks to work this from in front of the stumps, gets an inside edge onto the pad, but somehow it doesn't make it as far as forward short leg;

51.1;?;Hauritz to Taylor, no run cuts a fullish delivery, North makes a nice diving save at backward point;

50.5;?;Johnson to Patel, no run outside leg, Patel is beaten for pace, the ball thuds into the pads;
50.4;?;Johnson to Patel, no run quick bouncer that doesn't rise much, 151ks, and Jeetan does well to get under it, it has gone only rib high after pitching in Johnson's half;
50.3;W;Johnson to McCullum, OUT another soft dismissal, poor cricket by McCullum, straight delivery, going with the angle, McCullum drives hard, gets an edge, and Ponting takes it easily at second slip;Brendon McCullum c Ponting b Johnson 5 (31m 26b 1x4 0x6) SR: 19.23;
50.2;?;Johnson to McCullum, no run good bumper, 148ks, over the stumps, McCullum has to be quick to get under this as this one doesn't rise too high;
50.1;1;Johnson to Taylor, 1 run wide of off, pushed away to deep point;
49.6;?;Hauritz to McCullum, no run goes back and across, looking to turn it to leg, but Hauritz is too wide of off;

49.3;?;Hauritz to McCullum, no run moves back and across to defend one that is not too short;
49.2;4;Hauritz to McCullum, FOUR runs too full, too straight, McCullum moves across and sweeps it very fine, his first boundary;
49.1;?;Hauritz to McCullum, no run Hauritz continues to get some drift, McCullum gets close to it, though, and defends;

48.5;?;Johnson to Taylor, no run fuller delivery, driven to mid-off;
48.4;?;Johnson to Taylor, no run back of a length, defended to short cover;
48.3;4;Johnson to Taylor, FOUR runs that's the fastest Test century by a New Zealander! short and wide, and cuts it, not bothering about keeping it down, and it nearly flies all the way for six to third man boundary, from where the NZ women's hockey team is watching. Takes off his helmet, arms aloft, but he knows his job is not over;
48.2;?;Johnson to Taylor, no run pitched up, angling across him, pushed to cover-point;
48.1;?;Johnson to Taylor, no run short and sharp, 144ks, defended outside off;

45.2;?;Hauritz to McCullum, no run gets a stride in and pats it back to the bowler;
45.1;?;Hauritz to McCullum, no run turning into pads, defended to on;
44.6;?;Harris to Taylor, no run dropped again, by Watson, would you believe it? third life to Taylor, he drives at a full delivery outside off, gets a regulation edge and Watson drops one to his left, perfectly catchable height and not too far him either. Went with hard hands, I suppose as it went in and out, sort of grabbed at it;
44.5;4;Harris to Taylor, FOUR runs and he has created width here by leaning back slightly and through his quick hands. It was short enough, and he made room and cut it wide of gully, in the air;
44.4;?;Harris to Taylor, no run slower ball, 132ks, cutting into him, Taylor stays on the crease and defends;
44.3;?;Harris to Taylor, no run back of a length, plays this one with soft hands, towards silly mid-on;
44.2;?;Harris to Taylor, no run nice on-drive, length ball and he doesn't have to move forward to hit this one, but the mid-on is straight enough;

34.4;4;Bollinger to Taylor, FOUR runs and a superb shot again! short, not too wide, but he leans back slightly to make room, and doesn't bother about keeping the cut shot down, three fours in a row now;
34.3;4;Bollinger to Taylor, FOUR runs and he frustrates Ponting some more, slightly wider than the previous delivery and he throws his arms at it, and it takes the outside half of the bat and flies over point;

33.3;4;Hauritz to Taylor, FOUR runs poor bit of cricket from Taylor and Johnson! Taylor has waited just two deliveries before looking for the slog-sweep, and he has dragged it straight down the throat of Johnson at mid-on, whose hands have suddenly become porous and lets it through;

31.6;6;Watson to Taylor, SIX runs shot! Taylor special! Roscoe is putting up a show here! This is slightly back of a length, mind you, and he pulls it off the front foot, not bothering to keep it down, and brings up his fifty! What quick hands;

30.5;1;Bollinger to Watling, 1 run gets a bit big on him, gets on top of it, and pushes it between the two points, a hesitant single ensues, and had Hussey hit Taylor was a goner;
30.4;?;Bollinger to Watling, no run driven on the up, two bounces to mid-off;
30.3;2;Bollinger to Watling, 2 runs nice off-drive, it's a wide half-volley, but goes to the right of mid-off as opposed to left, that bat turned in his hands actually, gets a couple;

29.4;?;Watson to Taylor, no run full, moves across, must have interested Watson with a possible lbw but flicks it nicely, short midwicket deflects it to mid-on;
29.3;?;Watson to Taylor, no run squared up while defending it, an exaggerated back-and-across movement really;
29.2;?;Watson to Taylor, no run a ripper of a legcutter, beauty, there was no way he could have left it alone. It angled in, pitched around off, and then left him. real lucky to not have nicked it;

28.2;?;Bollinger to Watling, no run mix-up, mix-up, all thanks to a lovely dive from Clarke at cover-point, and Taylor has to go back from half way down and just about makes it;
28.1;4;Bollinger to Watling, FOUR runs thick edge, but soft hands mean it stays down, and to hurt Aussies more, it finds the gap between third slip and gully;
27.6;3;Watson to Watling, 3 runs straying on the pads, too full, and helped away easily even though he has got too far across and a bit inside the line;

 Innings Start
Australia have won the series two-nil. They win this test in Hamilton by 176 runs. New Zealand were always in trouble after having only posted a 33 run lead in the first innings undoing the great work by their bowlers on day one. Australia's second innings total swung the game in their favour. Simon Katich's hundred was the highlight but they had superb contributions all the way through the order. And Mitchell Johnson has cleaned up New Zealand in the fourth innings with 6 wickets to finish with 10 for the match.
So Australia win the series 2-0 after a dominant 10-wicket win in Wellington. New Zealand's inexperience was exposed by a very settled and confident Australian outfit. New Zealand don't play another test until they tour the subcontinent at the end of the year. Australia travel to England in July to play the shambolic Pakistan in two-tests before gearing up for the Ashes in November.
Man of the Match - Mitchell Johnson "I've enjoyed the tour. It's been great. To finish it off like we have today, it's been a great summer for the boys. It's always nice to contribute and be a part of this side"
There was no man of the series named at the presentation ceremony. Both captians thanked the crowd, sponsors, and their opponents.
That is it as far as cricinfo's live commentary coverage of the Trans-Tasman trophy is concerned. Don't forget to read Peter English's bulletin and Brydon Coverdale's coverage from Hamilton of the press conferences and the fall-out from this match.
