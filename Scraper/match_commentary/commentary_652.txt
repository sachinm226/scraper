Data
India won the toss but combusted on a difficult pitch. Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson bowled well to nail early wickets from which India never recovered. Sachin Tendulkar and Irfan Pathan added 49 but that stand was snapped at a crucial time. Then the last two men put on 41 to get India up to 148 but theres no hiding the fact India didnt bat out even 40 overs. Australia need 149 to ensure they cant lose the series. Stay with us for their chase shortly.

Johnson pitches it back of a length, Uthappa gets a stride forward from his crease and plays, but misses, and the ball raps him on the pads as it angles across off stump, and even before Johnson and Gilchrist finish appealing umpire Sahiba's finger shoots up ... an iffy call, as it looked like the ball was going outside the line of impact. And the height is an issue.;Robin Uthappa lbw b Johnson 5 (17m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 83.33;
6.6;4;Lee to Tendulkar, FOUR runs sweet! Lee just overpitches a touch and with the pitch not assisting any real quick bowling Tendulkar can just lean into a textbook-perfect drive through extra cover .. all timing and the placement was perfect ... Tendulkar stands and admires the shot;

Johnson bowls another short delivery, it sits up and Yuvraj stands leaden-footed as he goes for an airy shot outside off stump, theres the thinnest of under-edges which Gilchrist holds very low above the ground! An especially good take because Gilchrist was moving to his left initially but then had to adjust as the ball deviated to his right, plucking it one-handed very low. India jolted by three quick strikes;Yuvraj Singh c ?Gilchrist b Johnson 1 (16m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;

8.30 am local Hello and a very warm welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the fifth ODI between India and Australia at Vadodara.
News from the middle is that India have won the toss and they will bat. Thats two consecutive wins with the coin for Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and he had no hesitation to put his batsmen in. He did that at Chandigarh and India won a game. It remains to be seen what happens here at the IPCL ground.
I'm Jamie Alter, and along with George Binoy later in the morning will be your commentator for the day.
A crucial game, needless to day. If Australia win, there's no way they can lose the series. India need to prevent them doing that and make it 2-2 heading over to Nagpur.
Both sides have fielded unchanged sides.
There's less grass on this pitch than on the one in Chandigarh, and it looks a a batting paradise. That equates to runs, a good amount of them, and a tough day for the bowlers. A very flat pitch. (No hitting the high notes here!)
Incidentally, Sachin Tendulkar becomes the second player after Sri Lanka's Sanath Jayasuriya to feature in 400 ODIs. You can read a bit of what he had to say about "just another match" here.
And you can also read Anand Vasu's preview of this match.
We're not far away from the start. Do stay with us.
Let me quickly remind you about Slogout, the new online cricket game from Cricinfo. (Its one of my favorite past-times.) Play now!
8.50 am local Tendulkar received a trophy for completing 400 ODIs. There's a good crowd turned out.

8.59 am local All ready for the start? I am, and so are the players. India's openers are out in the middle, having a chat with Ricky Ponting as a swarm of dragonflies buzz around them. And there's Rahul Dravid with the pads on sitting on the players' balcony.
Brett Lee has the new ball and will bowl to Sourav Ganguly, with two slips waiting. The umpires call play and off Lee goes!
 Innings Start
A nine-wicket win for the visitors, as comprehensive as they come. The pace bowlers, lead by Brett Lee and five-wicket hero Mitchell Johnson, suffocated the trigger-happy top order and with only two partnerships to speak of, one worth 41 from the last two batsmen, India limped to a total of 148. They failed to even bat out 40 overs. Only four men reached double figures.
Australia then cantered to a nine-wicket win. Adam Gilchrist had a great day, pocketing six catches, being part of a run out, and then getting into some form with an unbeaten 79 from 77 deliveries.
India were under the gun from the first over of the match when some classically indecisive running between Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar gave Australia the initiative, and Rahul Dravid's first-ball dismissal hurt them hard. It was a tricky pitch initially with the ball staying low and stopping on the batsmen, but India just couldnt cope with Australia's attack.
A win at Nagpur will secure a series victory for Australia. Johnson is the Man of the Match for his sterling effort of a career-best 5 for 26. The best bowling for an Australian pace bowler in India.
Thats all we have for you today, but do join us for the next match on October 14. I thank you for tuning in to Cricinfo again and hope you've enjoyed our coverage. This is Jamie Alter, your commentator, signing off. Cheers.
