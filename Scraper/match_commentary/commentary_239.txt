"I'm going to take a flyer and say they're not going to go through," says Graeme Smith about West Indies' chances this World Cup, on our latest show of Contenders
----------------
Australia were 4 for 60, they end on 8 for 278. Smith was in serious touch again before he walked past one from Moeen. Maxwell looked as good, and made more than twice. Marsh looked good for many more before he was run out, and Faulkner could soon become a synonym for finishing. Australia recovering twice there, they were 7 for 224 as well.
Woakes having a pretty poor outing today. even as Moeen got through ten tight overs of offspin again. England have Johnson and Starc to face in the chase

Jay: "Haddin running marsh out and then giving his wicket away has probably cost Australia this match. Vital section of the game and momentum has swung back towards England. Very poor cricket."
 Innings Start
The Australians get their hands on the series trophy, and that is all from us for the moment. Good bye
Bailey: "Great to see Maxwell and Marsh rein in their natural games a bit and get us through. James can be a bit dramatic so I hope he is okay. We want to have as many guys in form as possible."
Morgan: "We could have kept them to a bit less. We had the best of the batting surface. Did not help ourselves with the shots we played. We keep grafting and learning as we go along, have made huge strides in the weeks we have been here. To have a place in the final we have played some good cricket."
Maxwell: "I have screwed it a few times before, it was nice to get through to that 40th over. I am just going to try and get past that three-figure mark. I was made aware of that."
Starc: "Have been working hard with Craig McDermott to improve every day. We bowled well as a unit through the series. Important to use the new ball and swing, I am not going to drop my pace trying to get it to swing."
Starc is the Man of the Series
Maxwell is the Man of the Match.
Australia take the triangular series with an emphatic, crushing win in the final. They haven't been beaten in the tournament, and have now won 11 of their previous 12 ODIs. Everything firing for them, barring George Bailey's bat. James Faulkner did go off the field feeling his side, after bowling only 2.3 overs, and Australia will hope he is not too bad.
Australia were 4 for 60, England 4 for 46. The difference: Glenn Maxwell, mainly... and er, Marsh, and Johnson, and Faulkner
