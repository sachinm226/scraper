Pollock to open (the bowling. Obviously. He hasn't defected to Australia). Blustery out there which could help him. Let's face it; South Africa need all the assistance they can get
Sad news has just come in from Cricinfo's obituary expert, Martin, who tells us Arthur Milton has died.
PT from Calgary needs a pub, though. "Australians in Calgary (and there's a lot of us) are lost!"
For those in Florida Churchill's Pub off 2nd Ave in Miami will show the World Cup...or at least it ought to, suggests Frank, who watched the Ashes from there.
Welcome back all. It is I, Will, here for another 10 over stint - which ought to be just enough time for Australia to knock off these 150 runs. Well nearly, anyway. I'm just finishing off my Ploughmans (cheddar, for the cheese freaks among you) and we're about five minutes away from starting. Damn smoking police. Anyway, hope our pub crawl information proved useful. If you do make it to one of those mentioned, we expect to receive full reports and photos please. It's the very least you can do.
1.25pm That's the public service broadcast over. Hope it helps. We are still not aware of anywhere in Miami and there have been loads of requests from there, so shout if you can help.
The match will resume fairly shortly and Will Luke will guide you through the opening bursts of the Australian innings in his own inimitable way. He is a bit angry at the moment as "No Smoking" strikers have just been plastered over the whole office, and as the only smoker, he's feeling a bit got at.
1.00pm Various readers have answered questions as to where the final will be shown in the USA. NY/NJ -Cafe Spice in Jersey City has been showing all World Cup matches, and Galaxy Cinema, Raleigh, NC is showing all the games, and Eight Mile Creek, an Aussie bar/restaurant on Mulberry St ... and also Ship of Fools on 2nd Ave at 82nd ... Boston - Tommy Doyle's in Harvard Square, upstairs. The Dosti bar and restaurant in Chicago area on Roselle Road has four big plasma TVs and they all show cricket matches live through out the year ... The Curry Pot, Corner of RT-21 and Washington ... San Francisco's Bay Area, Naaz at Fremont was supposed to show all matches. Just check with them. Annapoorna in San Mateo is another bet since they have Dish network. Joe Alfredo's at Oshawa (Toronto) is showing all games, as is The Holiday Inn Select (Airport) ... The West Indian Market on New Hampshire Avenue in Silver Spring, Maryland outside Washington DC and also Solly's on the corner of U and 11th ... in Los Angeles and Long Beach, the Springbok Bar and Grills ... in Dallas, you can watch live match at Masala Wok restaurant ... Montreal Champs Bar, on Boulevarde Saint Laurent ... Tudor Arms pub in Pickering, Ontario .... Ottawa, the rather fab Sri Lankan restaurant Ceylonta (on Somerset St) ... Nashville, the Vanderbilt Cricket Club is showing it at the Student Life Center ... Kansas City, the Kababesh Grill on 119th and 69Hwy ... we are also told that Minerva restaurants in Atlanta, Virginia and Maryland are showing the game ... Houston Darbar Restaurent (Indian buffet) Scarsadale Blvd, I-45 South Houston ... Philadelphia Royal India Restaurant in Malvern ... South Riding, Virginia Rajdhani Mandhir ...
A quick note - these suggestions are from readers and we in no way endorse them or vouch for the accuracy of the information.
Lubna Kabir reckons you don't need a bar for some places in the States - instead, Indian restaurants frequented by Indian, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Pakistani taxi drivers should do it - in Boston, DC and Philly for sure.
"Came out all right," says Tait, ambushed as he leaves the pitch by Greg Blewett, with understatement. "Yeah's, good." And what about Australia's batting to come? "You can't get too comfy. A decent target to chase."
That's South Africa's lowest score in the World Cup and Australia bounce off the field. On TV they are still pretending this game is well and truly alive, but the reality is that it will take something remarkable to prevent Australia reaching the final now.

42.2;1;Bracken to Kemp, 1 run Kemp sweeps, Bracken appeals thinking it missed the bat, but Bucknor disagrees;
42.1;1;Bracken to Langeveldt, 1 run Langeveldt drops into the leg side and runs. McGrath teapots that the No. 11 was allowed to get off strike first ball;

26.3;?;Tait to Pollock, no run right up there and that's poked into the covers. A bit of shuffling from Hogg in his sunhat as he takes his time to throw down the stumps. It looked in, and replays quickly confirmed it was;
26.2;?;Tait to Pollock, no run oh, Pollock was lucky to survive there, this one nipping back in off the seam and Pollock doing his valiant best to give Gilchrist another catching opportunity - but failed to get hold of it;
26.1;W;Tait to Hall, OUT and Tait strikes again! Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover, but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs's as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake;Andrew Hall c ?Gilchrist b Tait 3 (14m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 37.5;

40.4;?;Tait to Kemp, no run full, Langeveldt winds up and drives the ball to Hogg at mid-off;
40.3;?;Tait to Kemp, no run faster and a bit shorter, Langeveldt sways out of the way. It probably would have missed him anyway;
40.2;?;Tait to Kemp, no run slower ball - if you can describe 81mph as slower - and Langeveldt into line to block;
40.1;W;Tait to Nel, OUT short and wide, slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head;Andre Nel c Clarke b Tait 8 (45m 41b 1x4 0x6) SR: 19.51;
25.6;1;Hogg to Hall, 1 run turning away towards off again, this shot isn't so neat, an ugly chop down, yet again into the covers;
25.5;1;Hogg to Kemp, 1 run some room outside off, the batsman waits and cuts that away into the covers with a mere tuck of a cut;

25.2;?;Hogg to Hall, no run right up there, defended and if Gilchrist is to be believed that was a "Nice one, Georgie";
25.1;?;Hogg to Hall, no run tosses that one up, it dips naughtily at the last minute and the batsman rolls out a tame forward drive;
24.6;?;Tait to Kemp, no run another bouncer, straight, and that's well avoided;
24.5;?;Tait to Kemp, no run bouncer down the channel and Kemp leaves that one alone;
24.4;?;Tait to Kemp, no run better yorker this time, obviously the length was right as before, but this time it was on the toes and that's just defended forward;
24.3;?;Tait to Kemp, no run left alone outside off this time;
24.2;1;Tait to Hall, 1 run gets his yorker line all wrong, and that's worked off the toes out to Mr Hussey-Cricket on the deep square boundary and he does a slide and relay with McGrath;
24.1;?;Tait to Hall, no run awkward bounce to deal with that one, but Hall stays cool as ever defending down off the back foot;
39.6;1;Watson to Nel, 1 run bouncer, and another single up ... and down to third man;
39.5;1;Watson to Kemp, 1 run driven forward and there's another single;
39.4;1lb;Watson to Nel, 1 leg bye on leg, Nel tries to get bat on it, the umpire rules pad, and they shuffle a quick single;
39.3;1;Watson to Kemp, 1 run low full toss, driven out to straight midwicket where Ponting does well to dive and take the pace off the ball with a left-hand grasp. It's tidied up further out;
39.2;1lb;Watson to Nel, 1 leg bye speared in on leg, dinked into short cover, and there's a shy and a miss at the non-striker's end;
39.1;1;Watson to Kemp, 1 run up there and driven forward, straight, without much power;
38.6;?;Tait to Nel, no run driven forward and that rounds off another stifling over;

38.3;?;Tait to Nel, no run on leg, slower delivery, and that's prodded into mid-on;
38.2;?;Tait to Nel, no run up there again, a yorker on off stick, and that's bumped into the ground;
38.1;1;Tait to Kemp, 1 run on leg and that's driven out to McGrath at mid-on;
37.6;?;Watson to Nel, no run in the blockhole, but Nel doesn't block, rather he drives back to the bowler on the bounce, who snaps at it, gets his right hand on it and parries the ball into the ground;
37.5;?;Watson to Nel, no run lowish full toss - thigh height - and Nel deals well with the approaching weapon, defending that down without much fuss;
37.4;?;Watson to Nel, no run dinked into the leg side;

36.3;?;Tait to Nel, no run too quick for Nel who, like a spotty boy in a disco, aims a desperate - and futile - lunge at that one;
36.2;1;Tait to Kemp, 1 run changed his angle of approach ever so slightly, that's right up there on the money but poked forward for a quick single; good running;
36.2;1w;Tait to Kemp, 1 wide Tait flies into bowl, that lovely rhythm ending in a muscly delivery as ever - but all that effort goes to waste as this one is wide down off;
36.1;?;Tait to Kemp, no run on a length outside off and that nips back in, defended down;
35.6;?;Hogg to Nel, no run outside off, veering down, and that's tucked to point off the back foot;
35.5;?;Hogg to Nel, no run defended forward;
35.4;?;Hogg to Nel, no run oh, attempted flipper, and that's a big call from the Aussies, a better one from the umpires; that was sliding down off;
35.3;?;Hogg to Nel, no run outside off and that's cut down - the ball just died a touch on him, this pitch is pretty slow;
35.2;?;Hogg to Nel, no run comes forward, a deliberate yet clunky stride, and that's defended into the covers;
35.1;?;Hogg to Nel, no run right up there, awkward to deal with, and Nel pokes that one down;
34.6;?;Watson to Kemp, no run opens the face but can only run that one to gully;
34.5;1;Watson to Nel, 1 run nibbles in at the righthander, poked into the covers and they run a quick single;
34.4;4;Watson to Nel, FOUR runs on off, a touch short, and that's pulled round with a delightful pirouette behind square;
34.3;1;Watson to Kemp, 1 run width again, but only a mere hint; it's still enough to be cut down off the back foot fine down to third man;
34.2;4;Watson to Kemp, FOUR runs outside off, just a touch of width and that's a very good shot indeed, that one cut away off the back foot with a mere flick of the wrists;

33.6;?;Hogg to Nel, no run defended forward;

32.6;?;McGrath to Nel, no run right up there and, like a great exclusive, that's well dug out;
32.5;1;McGrath to Kemp, 1 run a hint of room which is enough to be guided behind point and leave Nel exposed;

32.3;?;McGrath to Kemp, no run cuts in on a good length, and just outside off, and the batsman clamps down on that, desperately keeping the ball out;

32.1;?;McGrath to Kemp, no run defended on the front foot;

31.5;?;Hogg to Nel, no run defends on the front foot;
31.4;?;Hogg to Nel, no run outside off and that's swished at on the front knee, horrid shot, almost playing that beside himself;

31.2;1lb;Hogg to Kemp, 1 leg bye on leg and that's tucked without much power off the thighs and into square leg;
31.1;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run stroked tamely, like patting a dog, off the back foot into the leg0side off the back foot;
30.6;2;McGrath to Nel, 2 runs sent high over midwicket, it lands safe and McGrath's hands fly to his hip as if there should be fielders everywhere;
30.5;?;McGrath to Nel, no run outside off, short, and Nel gamely has a slash at that one off the back foot, looking to send it to Row Z over covers. It doesn't even make blade of grass A off the wicket, as he misses it completely;
30.4;?;McGrath to Nel, no run;
30.3;?;McGrath to Nel, no run left alone outside off;
30.2;?;McGrath to Nel, no run poor Nel's a bit at sea here and there's more poking and missing;
30.1;1;McGrath to Kemp, 1 run a touch of width, very unMcGrathian, and that's worked away to the off-side sweeper;
29.6;?;Hogg to Nel, no run Hogg gets his revenge, Nel's got no idea what to do that with that and settles for poking a bat at it and it fizzes past his edge. Nel smiles, his tongue popping out, too;
29.5;?;Hogg to Nel, no run ooh, Nel pops up a catch into the vacant short-leg area. He's such a tease;
29.4;W;Hogg to Pollock, OUT awkward shot, checking his off-drive and that's chipped back to the bowler whose clasping fingers accept that fly-trap-style;Shaun Pollock c & b Hogg 5 (15m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.46;
29.3;?;Hogg to Pollock, no run on off and that's defended down off the back foot;
29.2;4;Hogg to Pollock, FOUR runs touch of room and Pollock waits for that, and cuts it away off the back foot through cover. Lovely shot, bringing up the hundred en route too, note you;
29.1;?;Hogg to Pollock, no run on off and Pollock gets his body over that one, defending it forward;
28.6;?;Tait to Kemp, no run slightly slower ball, up there, and that's defended down;
28.6;1w;Tait to Kemp, 1 wide down leg and that's accurately called wide;
28.5;?;Tait to Kemp, no run defended on the front foot;
28.4;?;Tait to Kemp, no run outside off and the batsman stands there like he's on the piste and about to fence at it - in the end, he stops with his bat suspended in the "Bat up!" position of coaching days of yore;
28.3;4;Tait to Kemp, FOUR runs on leg and that's tucked tidily round off the hips, very fine, through fine leg. Awful ball, got the treatment;
28.2;?;Tait to Kemp, no run left alone outside off this time;
28.1;?;Tait to Kemp, no run outside off and that's swished at off the back foot. Little foot movement, his turn to borrow the team glue;
23.6;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run comes forward and defends that one on the front foot. Not much fuss about that shot;
23.5;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run defended this time;
23.5;1w;Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide another wide down off. By George! Hogg can't believe that one - not sure why, it was very wide;
23.5;1w;Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide wide down off, Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut, but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it;
23.4;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run defended again, Kemp not looking at all comfortable;
23.3;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run pitches on middle, moves to off and Kemp's not sure how to play that - he tries to sweep, doesn't really get hold of the ball;
23.2;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run up there again, on middle, and that's defended once more, on the front foot again;
23.1;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run right up there, that's defended down and they choose to "Wait!";
22.6;?;Tait to Hall, no run good pace, right up there and scattering a cloud of dust as Hall edges that low, on the front foot, and unconvincingly down towards the slip region;
22.5;W;Tait to Gibbs, OUT got him this time! A very, very thin edge - much thinner than the one which wasn't given earlier, also to Tait - looking for the short-pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body;Herschelle Gibbs c ?Gilchrist b Tait 39 (77m 49b 6x4 0x6) SR: 79.59;
22.4;?;Tait to Gibbs, no run pushes him back up there to defend into the covers;
22.3;4;Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, way too much width and Gibbs just opens his shoulders and swings hard, and that one flies up off the base of the bat behind point, not quite where he intended it, but it fair raced away;
22.2;?;Tait to Gibbs, no run bouncer, straight and high. Tait follows through with a serious look on his face - he means more business here all right;
22.1;?;Tait to Gibbs, no run grunts that one in at the righthander, up there outside off, and that's driven into the covers with a bark of a "Wait!";
21.6;1;Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg and that turns towards leg even more, the batsman just poking that into short square;
21.6;1w;Hogg to Gibbs, 1 wide outside leg, chased round, and that's just to say wide;
21.5;1;Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on middle, doesn't read that one, and a tentative prod from Kemp sends an outside edge backward of point;
21.4;1;Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run another ball on leg, another sweep, this one dinked as gentle as the others;
21.3;?;Hogg to Gibbs, no run the one that went the other way - the ball, not his tongue - and that slavers outside off and is left alone easily;
21.2;1;Hogg to Kemp, 1 run swept that round behind square;
21.1;1;Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg, the batsman comes forward and sweeps that round on the front foot behind square;
20.6;?;Watson to Kemp, no run defended off the back foot into the covers;
20.5;6;Watson to Kemp, SIX runs short and Kemp's on that one so quickly, fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet - top work, that was close to him, and although he didn't get hold of it properlyit sailed away. And that's the fifty partnership;
20.4;?;Watson to Kemp, no run left alone this time;
20.3;?;Watson to Kemp, no run beautiful delivery that one, nipping back in at the righthander and threatening to kiss the outside edge;

20.1;?;Watson to Kemp, no run on leg and that's skewed in front of square to the man there;
19.6;?;Hogg to Gibbs, no run beaten! Terrific ball, the wrong'un which he plays at and misses, Hogg's tongue slavers around uncontrollably;
19.5;1;Hogg to Kemp, 1 run on leg stump - flatter and quicker and defended;
19.4;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run and he plays and misses outside off - the arm ball there;
19.3;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run full and straight, blocked out;
19.2;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run ooh, this one holds up on him - just outside off, spinning back into him and jumping up a touch, it's blocked out;
19.1;1;Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run on leg stump, picked off for a single;
18.6;?;Watson to Kemp, no run another good one just outside off. Watson bowling with excellent control so far and it's blocked out;
18.5;?;Watson to Kemp, no run swinging into him, it's defended on the front foot;
18.4;2;Watson to Kemp, 2 runs Kemp late-cuts this with oodles of time, and class, behind point and wide of third man who sprints to his right to field;
18.3;?;Watson to Kemp, no run ah, now then - that's more like it from Watson. An excellent bouncer which takes the batsman by surprise, as he attempts to pull before deciding to leave it well alone;
18.2;?;Watson to Kemp, no run excellent ball on off stump and he comes forward to defend this out to cover;
18.1;?;Watson to Kemp, no run defended on the front foot;
17.6;1;Hogg to Kemp, 1 run a full bunger from Hogg, punched through cover - rather takes Kemp by surprise, hence not trying to hit it into the USA;
17.5;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run "awwwww" cries Gilchrist, or Hogg - not sure who - as this quicker ball is blocked out on middle;
17.4;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run blocked out on the front foot;
17.3;1;Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run flicked through midwicket;
17.2;1;Hogg to Kemp, 1 run very well played again, straighter this time and he plants his foot down the pitch and ladles it around the corner;

16.6;1;Watson to Kemp, 1 run on middle-and-off, Kemp lunges forward like a monster and defends;

16.4;?;Watson to Gibbs, no run pushed back to the bowler and Gibbs gives him a stare. And why not?;
16.3;?;Watson to Gibbs, no run good idea from Watson, who increasingly resembles the incredible hulk, bouncing the batsman...but he's pretty settled now, ducking underneath it easily;
16.2;?;Watson to Gibbs, no run better; Gibbs is solid, defending it on the front foot;
16.1;4;Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs poor delivery, short and straight, Gibbs pulling it behind square;
15.6;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run and again he's beaten;
15.5;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run what a ball from the tongue-master, a wrong'un which Kemp complete misreads, coming forward, trying to defend, but missing it by a country mile;
15.4;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run that's more like it from Kemp, hammering it on the front foot and timing it very well but straight to cover;
15.3;?;Hogg to Kemp, no run well bowled, on middle stump and Kemp comes forward - massively - defending it on the front foot;
15.2;1;Hogg to Gibbs, 1 run again on leg stump - quick and flat - turned around the corner;

14.5;1;Watson to Gibbs, 1 run a Watson slower-ball which is nicely nudged off the front foot down to fine leg;
14.4;?;Watson to Gibbs, no run just a little wider this time from Watson and Gibbs is back-and-across, pushing it out to cover;
14.3;?;Watson to Gibbs, no run much better from Watson - that's the length and it's pumped back to the bowler;
14.2;?;Watson to Gibbs, no run and Gibbs drives with vast amounts of class here, but straight to cover;
14.1;4;Watson to Gibbs, FOUR runs what a magnificent shot from Gibbs, a flick behind square which beats the man at deep square leg;
13.6;?;Bracken to Kemp, no run this time he decides against using his rib cage, preferring the willow. He's forward, he's defending and he's roaring a loud "no";
13.5;?;Bracken to Kemp, no run gets into a bit of a tangle, Kemp, here. A shorter delivery which rises up on him and he defends, using his chest;
13.4;1;Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run ah, delightful shot, coming forward on the front foot and just working it - smudging it - through midwicket;
13.3;?;Bracken to Gibbs, no run defended on the front foot;
13.2;1;Bracken to Kemp, 1 run ooh close! A lovely delivery angling across a very nervous Justin Kemp who, even more nervously, pushes forward without conviction and edges it past the second slip;
13.1;1;Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run and he starts lazily, drifting it down the leg side and Gibbs plucks it with ease to leg;
12.6;?;Tait to Kemp, no run cracking ball, at high pace, swinging into the right hander who digs it out at the very last moment. A yorker, in fact;
12.5;?;Tait to Kemp, no run on off stump this time, much better, and it's firmly defended;
12.5;5w;Tait to Kemp, 5 wide oh dear, Tait's replaced his sniper rifle with the greater-spotted potato gun. This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn't have a chance;
12.4;1;Tait to Gibbs, 1 run oh hello, a Tait slower ball. That's new - or at least, I've not seen it much before. Gibbs reads it, though, and on the front foot neatly guides it down to third man with surprising deftness;
12.3;?;Tait to Gibbs, no run ah, very good comeback from Tait just pitching it up a smidgen more; Gibbs, looking a little terrified in fact, is back in his crease and defending it without great conviction;
12.2;4;Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs outside off, Gibbs plants his foot and slashes it over the slips - not far off at all;
12.1;1lb;Tait to Kemp, 1 leg bye Another prehistoric grunt from Tait as he flings this down - but it's a little too straight and worked off his pads;
11.6;?;McGrath to Gibbs, no run Gibbs again leaves it alone outside off;
11.5;?;McGrath to Gibbs, no run ever so slightly wider from McGrath - the teaser; the tempter - but Gibbs won't be teased or tempted and leaves it alone like a big winner;
11.4;?;McGrath to Gibbs, no run and McGrath is in once again, chugging up to the crease and again lands it on a sixpenny and Gibbs is forced to block it out on the front foot;
11.3;?;McGrath to Gibbs, no run right in the channel there, absolutely perfect line just outside off stump and he comes forward, rather tentatively, defending it back to McGrath;
11.2;?;McGrath to Gibbs, no run classic McGrath, cutting this back into him and it's defended solidly;
11.1;1;McGrath to Kemp, 1 run Short and quick from McGrath; Kemp gets into an almighty mess, hopping and skipping like a nervous rabbit but they scamper through for a single;
10.6;?;Tait to Gibbs, no run very well bowled from Tait, who has so far been far from the scattergun. In fact, he's been sniper-like: a 93.4mph (150ish kph) inswinger which Gibbs is very late on, nudging it to leg;
10.5;?;Tait to Gibbs, no run shorter this time from Tait, and he grunts in doing so, forcing Gibbs back into his crease and he defends off the back foot;
10.4;?;Tait to Gibbs, no run ooh well bowled, Tait, cutting this back into Gibbs who is back into his crease - rather late on it - defending off the back foot;
10.3;4;Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs fabulous shot. The most textbook of cover drives, creaming it on the front foot through extra cover;
10.2;4;Tait to Gibbs, FOUR runs and he crashes this on the front foot but it's just wide of the lone slip - and I reiterate, there's just one slip in there;
10.1;?;Tait to Gibbs, no run and another! But Bucknor doesn't raise his finger. A fierce inswinger as Gibbs goes right back, inside edges it to Gilchrist who tumbles to his left but...Bucknor refuses to raise his finger;
9.6;?;McGrath to Kemp, no run oh my goodness ... Kemp leaves and the ball passes knee-shakingly close to his off stump. Good judgment ... but a great over from McGrath.;
9.5;W;McGrath to Boucher, OUT McGrath on a hat-trick ... much better ball, a stock McGrath delivery, Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip;Mark Boucher c Hayden b McGrath 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
9.4;W;McGrath to Prince, OUT And that might be it ... about the worst ball McGrath has bowled, wide and angled away from the left-hander, but Prince slashes, gets a thin edge, and Gilchrist does the rest;Ashwell Prince c ?Gilchrist b McGrath 0 (4m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
9.3;1;McGrath to Gibbs, 1 run McGrath drifts to leg - seriously - and Gibbs turns the ball just in front of square;
9.2;?;McGrath to Gibbs, no run Gibbs thrusts his pad down the pitch, covering any movement, and then opts to leave;
9.1;?;McGrath to Gibbs, no run McGrath seems almost a spinner after watching Tait ... good line, good length and defended;
8.6;?;Tait to Prince, no run right back and drops the ball at his feet;
8.5;W;Tait to de Villiers, OUT full, de Villiers drives with no foot movement, and a thick kick carries straight to Gilchrist. A fourth delivery over 90mph, a good mixture of length, and now South Africa are up against it;AB de Villiers c ?Gilchrist b Tait 15 (39m 34b 3x4 0x6) SR: 44.11;
8.4;?;Tait to de Villiers, no run short - another 90mph+ delivery - and de Villiers sways back just in case;
8.3;?;Tait to de Villiers, no run slower ball - 91.9mph - and de Villiers is almost early on the attempted pull. It did keep low outside off ...;
8.2;?;Tait to de Villiers, no run fired in at almost 93mph and de Villiers blocks off the back foot;
8.1;4;Tait to de Villiers, FOUR runs Tait opens with a bouncer at 88mph, and it's almost as if de Villiers has been sent advanced notice, he's on it so fast and hammers that over midwicket;
7.6;1;McGrath to de Villiers, 1 run de Villiers leaps out of his crease to meet the ball and square drives to the sweeper;
7.5;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run stock McGrath delivery, niggly and just outside off;
7.4;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run Glichrist takes that as de Villiers ushers it by;
7.3;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run pushed into the off side, pounced on like a fly in a Venus thingytrap;
7.2;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run slightly closer to the off stump but again the batsman not lured into anything;
7.1;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run McGrath starts his fourth over with a loosener outside off;
6.6;1;Bracken to de Villiers, 1 run driven firmly to the left of mid-off, and that placement allows for the easy single;
6.5;?;Bracken to de Villiers, no run de Villiers happy to leave one a foot outside the off;
6.4;1;Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run Gibbs shapes to flick to leg, gets a thick edge via pad, and the ball plops into the on side;
6.3;?;Bracken to Gibbs, no run left alone;
6.2;1;Bracken to de Villiers, 1 run pushed to mid-on, Watson picks up and throws at the bowler's end, de Villiers was out had the ball hit. At 18 for 2, that was just daft;
6.1;1;Bracken to Gibbs, 1 run wide and a slashed drive races to deep backward point;
5.6;4;McGrath to de Villiers, FOUR runs McGrath drops short, de Villiers on it in a flash and smashes that past a diving short midwicket. That was really clobbered;
5.5;1;McGrath to Gibbs, 1 run half-volley outside off, driven to Hogg at mid-off and they scurry through for a quick single;
5.4;?;McGrath to Gibbs, no run 84mph from McGrath. Either the old man is fired up or, as has happened a few times, the speed gun is up the creek. Anyhow, outside off and Gibbs watches and leaves;
5.3;W;McGrath to Kallis, OUT Kallis again gives himself room and advances to meet the ball, but McGrath fires in a yorker which clatters into the off stump;Jacques Kallis b McGrath 5 (12m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
5.2;4;McGrath to Kallis, FOUR runs Kallis dances down the track, McGrath sees him step to leg, follows him, but Kallis still punches that past extra cover;
5.1;?;McGrath to Kallis, no run Kallis not remotely tempted as the ball passes by and Gilchrist takes by his feet;
4.6;?;Bracken to de Villiers, no run another good over ends with a leave from de Villiers;
4.5;?;Bracken to de Villiers, no run de Villiers back, into line, and blocks into the off;
4.4;?;Bracken to de Villiers, no run a grunt from Bracken, and then a delivery wide off off stump which de Villiers leaves;
4.3;1;Bracken to Kallis, 1 run a rather limp drive between cover fielders, muted cheers and a solitary horn welcome the run to the man in the deep;
4.2;?;Bracken to Kallis, no run a strangled appeal as the ball hits Kallis high on the pad ... he had taken two big steps down the pitch;
4.1;?;Bracken to Kallis, no run punched off the back foot into the covers, and all with one hand as the bottom one slips off the handle as he plays the stroke;
3.6;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run on target, de Villiers into line and plays into the leg side;
3.5;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run pushed defensive shot, a thick inside edge and the ball dribbles into the leg side;
3.4;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run quicker - 83mph - and de Villiers drawn forward and then leaves with a theatrical flourish;
3.3;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run fractionally too wide, and McGrath looks to the heavens as he knows that's not quite the right line;
3.2;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run McGrath continues with his nagging line fractionally outside off - 79mph - and de Villiers not tempted to nibble ... yet;
3.1;?;McGrath to de Villiers, no run wide and left;
2.6;?;Bracken to Kallis, no run 82mph, and Kallis plays a slightly hurried defensive jab;
2.5;?;Bracken to Kallis, no run wider, and Kallis able to watch that pass;
2.4;?;Bracken to Kallis, no run Kallis spars and misses one outside off, much oohing and aahing among players, crowd and Cricinfo staff. 79mph for speed freaks.;
2.3;W;Bracken to Smith, OUT Smith again walks down the pitch to meet the ball, shapes to hit over the top and a sniff of swing takes the ball past the bat and into the off stump;Graeme Smith b Bracken 2 (10m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40;
2.2;?;Bracken to Smith, no run this time Smith stays anchored to the crease and pushes into the covers;
2.1;?;Bracken to Smith, no run Smith takes a stroll down the pitch before Bracken is even in his delivery stride, prods and misses;

It's more than a breeze blowing across the ground ... flags are horizontal
 Innings Start
That's all from Jenny Thompson, Will Luke and Martin Williamson. Many thanks for staying with us through a one-sided match and we will be back, along with Sriram Veera and Jamie Alter, for Saturday's final. It's almost all over ...
Presentations "We tried to be nice and positive," admits Smith. "It's a fantastic feeling," grins Ponting. The Man-of-the-Match award went to Glenn McGrath.
Australia win by seven wickets The South Africans acknowledge the support they have received and then head off to lick their wounds, the Australians amble onto the outfield and start a lap of honour.
A clinical performance from the defending champions and the dominated this game from the off. The last few hours have been pretty poor for neutrals, dreadful for South Africans, but that's not Australia's fault. They have done the business and will meet Sri Lanka on Saturday in a re-match of the 1996 final.

24.5;1;Pollock to Clarke, 1 run Clarke stands tall and smacks the ball off the back foot through extra cover;
24.4;W;Pollock to Hayden, OUT Hayden hits that one the up and dead straight, but he gets under it, Smith runs round a few yards from long-on and holds a steepler, but his knee buckles as he took the catch.;Matthew Hayden c Smith b Pollock 41 (115m 60b 4x4 0x6) SR: 68.33;

9.3;4;Kallis to Hayden, FOUR runs absolutely magnificent shot. The power...just breathless. Perfectly reasonable ball; Hayden swings through the line like a monster, and even though it rattles off the non-striker's stumps, no one can stop that going for four. Ominous power;

9.1;1;Kallis to Hayden, 1 run swinging into Hayden who works it through midwicket;

8.4;3;Nel to Hayden, 3 runs on leg stump, Hayden leans on it and clips it through midwicket. But the man at deep midwicket makes a fumble, allowing them through for two. Hall is not pleased, and the stump mic picks up every word;
8.3;?;Nel to Hayden, no run tighter line and a fuller length which Hayden back-cuts to point;
8.2;?;Nel to Hayden, no run just a touch wide, giving Hayden the room to free his arms and he strokes it to cover but Hall does magnificently to prevent the single. Or the two, three or indeed four;
8.1;?;Nel to Hayden, no run defended on the front foot;
7.6;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run worked to leg but no single on offer;
7.5;1;Kallis to Hayden, 1 run pushed to mid-off this time and he sets off for a single;
7.4;4;Kallis to Hayden, FOUR runs grief, that is some shot from Hayden. No great foot movement, flicked on the up through mid-on for four. Extraordinary shot in fact;
7.3;?;Kallis to Hayden, no run hammered! My word, he very nearly killed short extra cover. Andrew Hall the fielder there;
7.2;?;Kallis to Hayden, no run crunched on the front foot to cover;
7.1;?;Kallis to Hayden, no run ooh and a play-and-a-miss outside off - fuller this time from Kallis and Hayden tries to late cut, but the ball kept a touch low;
7.1;1w;Kallis to Hayden, 1 wide good bounce from Kallis but, oh dear, it's very wide of the off stump and rightly wided by the not-so-wide umpire;
6.6;?;Nel to Ponting, no run driven to mid-off;
6.5;1;Nel to Hayden, 1 run but it's too straight, Nel not able to adjust his line and Hayden clips a single to leg;
6.4;1;Nel to Ponting, 1 run ooh that's better from Nel, a tighter line which forces Ponting to defend...though it's padded away and they pick up a single;
6.3;4;Nel to Ponting, FOUR runs terrible ball, a massive wide which Ponting just leans into, stroking it through cover, bisecting mid-off and cover, and it races for four. Absolutely no chance of stopping that;
6.2;1;Nel to Hayden, 1 run banged in short, but it's down the leg side and Hayden works it down to fine-leg. Nel falls over in his follow-through, as he so often does;
6.1;?;Nel to Hayden, no run and it's defended off the back foot;
5.6;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run a textbook cover drive, but straight to mid-off;
5.5;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run driven to extra cover;
5.4;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run good length, just drawing Ponting forward - at good pace, too - and Ponting cracks it on the front foot, opening the face of the bat, to Gibbs at point;
5.3;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run another big stride down the pitch from Ponting, creaming it to cover. He looks in absurd touch;
5.2;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run too straight from Kallis, on Ponting's middle stump and he flicks his wrists to midwicket, setting off for a single before Hayden sends him back;
5.1;?;Kallis to Ponting, no run a touch too wide but a good length, Ponting defends off the back foot back to Kallis;
4.6;4;Pollock to Hayden, FOUR runs oh he's definitely had enough now, Hayden. A stroke of brute, ugly power, heaving it through midwicket, flat, for four;
4.5;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run good length just outside off and Hayden is resolute in defence;
4.4;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run a squirted, smudged yet purposeful inside edge to mid-on;
4.3;1;Pollock to Ponting, 1 run that's a terrific line from Pollock, on off stump and Ponting pushes it just past the bowler - immediately Ponting sets off for a run, and gets it, much to Pollock's disgust;
4.2;3;Pollock to Hayden, 3 runs oh but he's off the mark now. Hayden's had enough of this block-prod-block malarkey, picking up this half volley and dispatching it over midwicket for four. Not pretty, but very Hayden-esque;
4.1;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run cut to point; Hayden still can't get off the mark;
3.6;4;Langeveldt to Ponting, FOUR runs exquisitely driven straight back past the bowler for four. No more need be said;
3.5;?;Langeveldt to Ponting, no run "nah mate," cries Ponting as he creams this straight to cover;
3.4;?;Langeveldt to Ponting, no run ah, good comeback from Langeveldt, the former prison officer, forcing Ponting to defend on the front foot. That's the length;
3.3;4;Langeveldt to Ponting, FOUR runs shot, Ponting, pulling this shorter delivery quite beautifully through midwicket - in front of square, too;
3.2;?;Langeveldt to Ponting, no run good line, here, Ponting pushing it off the back foot;
3.2;1nb;Langeveldt to Ponting, (no ball) cracked off the back foot to cover;
3.1;4;Langeveldt to Ponting, FOUR runs and he's dropped. Ponting pulls, with immense power, and Prince at short midwicket dives to his right to attempt to pull off one of the tournament's most brilliant catches...but can only get a fingertip to it. Such was the force if Ponting's stroke that it still went for four;
2.6;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run and he finishes the over well, dead-eye straight and Hayden works it to leg but can't get a single;
2.5;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run well bowled. Angling across Hayden who immediately decides to leave it alone, shouldering arms. Six of those please, Pollock;
2.4;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run just short of a length, Hayden cuts it to cover but again can't break the gap;
2.3;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run swinging into Hayden, a much better length this time and it's pushed to a short extra cover;
2.2;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run far too wide from Pollock who is very fortunate not to be clattered for at least four; Hayden cracked it powerfully off the back foot but straight to point;
2.1;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run Hayden is forward, taking a giant stride down the pitch, working it powerfully to mid-off;
1.6;4;Langeveldt to Ponting, FOUR runs my word, that is a thing of majesty from Ponting. On his middle-and-leg stump, he walks into the most perfectly timed on-drive;
1.5;?;Langeveldt to Ponting, no run a touch too short again but the line was straight, forcing Ponting to defend which he did with the straightest of bats;
1.4;?;Langeveldt to Ponting, no run ah, there's the length; Ponting comes forward, almost walking into this forward defensive;
1.3;?;Langeveldt to Ponting, no run again very wide and much too short from Langeveldt, allowing Ponting to crack it off the back foot into the covers;
1.2;?;Langeveldt to Ponting, no run and that'll be another wide this time outside the off stump. But no, Aleem Dar thinks about it but decides it's just within the limitations;
1.2;1w;Langeveldt to Ponting, 1 wide well he got a bit too excited there, Langeveldt. Short, wobbling down Ponting's leg side who attempted to pull before realising there was no need;
1.1;W;Langeveldt to Gilchrist, OUT oh and he's bowled him! A terrific ball, swinging very late into Gilchrist who was rather trapped on the crease - trying to work it to leg - and it squeezed through the gate, knocking out his middle stump;Adam Gilchrist b Langeveldt 1 (4m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
0.6;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run Pollock roars for no apparent reason, probably just felt like it, and Hayden defends this off the back foot;
0.5;?;Pollock to Hayden, no run short and wide, Hayden's eyes light up and he cracks it straight to short extra cover;
0.4;1;Pollock to Gilchrist, 1 run Pollocks drifts this one down the leg side and Gilchrist nobbles it off his pads for a bye;
0.3;?;Pollock to Gilchrist, no run a well-timed defensive push back to the bowler;
0.2;?;Pollock to Gilchrist, no run just angling back into Gilchrist this time who rocks back, defends it to leg and tells Hayden to "wait there". Hayden does just that;
0.1;?;Pollock to Gilchrist, no run on off stump, a good length and it's defended;

Apparently, according to Botham, South Africa have "no second chance" here. Well I never.
