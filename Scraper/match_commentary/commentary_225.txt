Data
4.25pm Pakistan dismissed Hazlewood and Handscomb in successive balls soon after tea, but Lyon and Bird frustrated them a 49-run last-wicket stand in 66 balls. They hauled Australia past 400. Bird's wings were clipped for batting failures, and he was omitted for the SA series. He probably proved a point with his 19 not out today; he made more runs than Khawaja, Maddinson, and Wade put together. He now has to do the job with the ball
130.1;W;Yasir Shah to Lyon, OUT Yasir finally breaks the last-wicket stand. He finishes with only two wickets. Could have had four or even five. Australia have been dismissed for 429. Tossed up higher, Lyon flicks, but can't keep it down. Shafiq pouches another catch, this one simpler than the ones at slips. Taken at midwicket;Nathan Lyon c Asad Shafiq b Yasir Shah 29 (55m 24b 6x4 0x6) SR: 120.83;

126.6;?;Yasir Shah to Lyon, no run an appeal for lbw after Lyon misses the sweep and is hit on the pad, the umpire says not out and Pakistan review.

Back of a length and outside off, kicks up and away from the left-hander off the pitch. The Gabba track has quickened up on the second day. He fends at it feebly, sticking his bat out on the back foot, and feeds an edge to the keeper.

98.1;1;Yasir Shah to Smith, 1 run Dropped by Amir. Third reprieve for Smith in this Test. That should have been taken, fairly easy chance. Smith takes on the man in the deep and gets away. Yasir gives this plenty of air, tossed-up legbreak, Smith runs down the track and aimed a lofted hit. He is beaten in flight and ends up slicing the ball in the air. Amir runs back and to his left from long-off, attempts the catch with both hands. The ball, though, moves further away from him. Amir gets into an awkward side-on position. It bobbles out of his hands, hits his shoulder, goes down as the fielder looks back over his shoulder. Amir throws his head back in despair;

To add insult to the injury, the ball trickles away to the boundary. The physio and the team doctor are out to tend to him. He is now being carried off the field by a golf cart. Then the physio and a team-mate help him towards the dressing room. The knee has swelled up, it seems like. Amir had earlier attempted a silly dive at mid-on in the 17th over.

60.4;?;Azhar Ali to Handscomb, no run;
60.3;3;Azhar Ali to Smith, 3 runs short and width outside off, cut on the back foot through backward point. Azam chases the ball, just about cuts it off with a slide by the edge of the boundary. He nearly touched the ball while his foot was in contact with the ad board;

58.3;?;Azhar Ali to Smith, no run dropped. Not off Amir, though, if that offers any consolation. Biting legbreak, pitches outside off, and turns away. Smith goes back and edges it. He is squared up.

58.2;?;Azhar Ali to Smith, no run length ball on off, defended on the back foot;
58.1;?;Azhar Ali to Smith, no run pitched up and outside off, driven to cover;

That is dinner on the first day. Renshaw showed excellent judgement on and outside off before he nicked Wahab behind for 71. Renshaw's was the only wicket to fall in this session. Pakistan could have had another had Sarfraz hung onto a thin edge behind the stumps in the last over before dinner. Smith has passed fifty, Handscomb is still edgy. Amir gave him a proper workout with a string of full balls. Handscomb seems like an lbw candidate. Yasir, meanwhile, wheeled away without any reward in the post-tea session. Pakistan slowed the hosts down, but Australia will be the happier of the two teams now. Be back for the last session of the day to see if the scene turns. Will the pink ball misbehave under lights?
Tim Jones: "Handscomb reminds me of a right-handed Gary Ballance. He's clearly talented, but with that technique, surely full, swinging deliveries are the way to go against him."
vinodh: "There it is! Dropped catches & PAK .. the affair continues..."
niksau: "Virat was dropped in the last match against England on 60 and went on to make 235! Giving Smith a chance is a mistake of the same order. This could prove very costly for Pak."
Caleb: "Simply not good enough that dropped catch! Teams continually give Smith and Warner chances, when will they learn. Also I called for Azhar Ali into the attack earlier and he is proven that he should be bowling more!"
 Innings Start
Australia have not enforced the follow-on. Warner and Renshaw scamper off.
Australia have secured a 287-run lead. They may look at 200 runs today and put Pakistan back in, under lights later in the day.
54.6;W;Bird to Sarfaraz, OUT direct hit and Pakistan will get the run in the end. "Pahunch gaya? (did you reach)" asks Sarfraz. The third umpire is called for. Full and wide outside off, driven to Warner at mid-off who effects the direct hit. Rahat's bat is in the air, but by the time the bail leaves the groove, Rahat's bat is down on the turf. Actually, it looks like the light turned on with Rahat's bat still in the air. Different angles, one more apparent than the other. Yes, given. Poor running from Rahat. Tried to slide his bat back in, but the bat bounced just before the crease and bobbled up. Just in the air, almost had it down and only a bit of daylight visible, but enough evidence to rule him out.;Rahat Ali run out (Warner) 4 (20m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80;
54.5;4;Bird to Sarfaraz, FOUR runs short and wide from Bird. Sarfraz scythes it through backward point for four. Too much width from Bird;

54.3;?;Bird to Sarfaraz, no run swept again, this time on the ground to deep fine leg;
54.2;4;Bird to Sarfaraz, FOUR runs dropped by Maddinson at deep square leg. By their standards, that should have been taken. Sarfraz gets low and nails his slog sweep. Maddinson backtracks and gets to his right, but can;t hold onto the overhead chance. Didn't get there as quickly as he could.;
54.1;?;Bird to Sarfaraz, no run 131 kph, good length outside off, chopped to third man. Doesn't want the run;
53.6;1;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 1 run nudged through square leg for a run. Unbelievable tactics from Smith. Not sure why he won't cover that area off. Sarfraz would have wanted nothing more, especially with Rahat at the other end;
53.5;2;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 2 runs Sarfraz gets to fifty. Short on off, worked through square leg. The fielder trots after it, allows the second to be completed. Real fighting knock from Sarfraz;
53.4;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run blocked out into the leg side;
53.3;2;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 2 runs swept away to the other side of Warner at backward square leg. Even Warner can't prevent two. Not many can;

50.5;?;Bird to Rahat Ali, no run good length on middle, blocked out;
50.4;W;Bird to Amir, OUT big appeal. No says the umpire. Steven Smith reviews. Bird has no idea. But there is a huge blotch on the inside edge. Bird was getting some movement in the over, this one nips back in from a good length. Amir is cut in half, and the ball snicks the inside edge. Just a faint edge, but very discernible. Amir cannot believe the decision. Hit the bat and the elbow on its way to the keeper, that's what Amir would have felt. Definitely out. RTS confirms the edge with a spike when ball passes bat. Good review from Australia;Mohammad Amir c ?Wade b Bird 21 (69m 69b 2x4 0x6) SR: 30.43;
50.3;?;Bird to Amir, no run yea, just a bit of movement for Bird. Good length on middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler;

49.4;?;Lyon to Amir, no run blocked into the off side, nice pace this from Lyon;
49.3;?;Lyon to Amir, no run a bit of an appeal, but that's sliding down. Flat on the pads, Amir is beaten on the inside edge;

46.5;2;Starc to Amir, 2 runs nice drive. Full and wide outside off, caressed to extra cover for a couple more;

46.3;?;Starc to Amir, no run back of a length outside off, guided to gully from the crease. A nice stop by the fielder, diving away to his right. Keeps Amir on strike;

41.6;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run Wade fluffs a stumping chance. Sarfraz races down the track and is nowhere close to the pitch of this tossed-up offbreak. It turns, dips, and bounces over the stumps, Wade messes up, probably undone by the bounce. The ball bobbles out of the gloves;

13.6;1lb;Wahab Riaz to Smith, 1 leg bye good finish to the over after that first ball. Full delivery on off, Smith had shuffled across, was struck on the pad and Misbah chooses to review.

Renshaw sees an opportunity to clip through the leg side but he is squared up by just enough lateral movement.

2.2;W;Amir to Warner, OUT Warner goes. Shortish delivery outside off, Warner looks to belt that through midwicket but is beaten by some pace and some bounce. All he can do is bunt his pull to mid-on. Came more off the splice. Not too many times Warner is hustled for pace. Not much lateral movement, but not an easy pitch to execute that stroke;David Warner c Wahab Riaz b Mohammad Amir 12 (10m 8b 2x4 0x6) SR: 150;
2.1;?;Amir to Warner, no run 139 kph, just enough movement to keep Warner in check. Good length around off, Warner is squared up slightly and skews a block to cover;

0.2;4;Amir to Warner, 4 runs four more. This time, they run it. Short and wide, slashed through point. Yasir chases it down but the dimensions are so long that they can easily complete four;

2.05pm Warner and Renshaw will open. Amir has the new pink ball.
 Innings Start
2.40pm A great end to an unbelievably good Test match. These two teams resume battle with the traditional Boxing Day Test at the G. We will be there then to bring you that. Until then.
2.18pm End of the best Test match of the year. What a game we've had. Superb fighting effort from Pakistan. They're obviously disconsolate, but needn't be. They almost pulled off the most improbable heist in Test history. They came into the fifth day needing 108 to win. Shafiq and Yasir Shah got that total down to about 41 without losing their heads under pressure. But a stunning delivery fro Starc set the game up for Australia, removing the centurion Shafiq with what was probably the ball of the Test. Australia, then, take a 1-0 lead. Not sure how many times a team takes an extra half hour to wrap up the Test, and then nearly loses it. But that's the way it all goes.
Time for the presentation.
Asad Shafiq is the Man of the Match: "I was hitting the ball well in the nets. A matter of time before I had a good innings. (the tail) showed a lot of courage and funk. We almost chased 490, because of our tail. There was energy (in the morning), thinking we had to go for a match. I was not expecting that from Starc, he bowled a couple of really good spells.
Misbah-ul-Haq: "I'm happy because, after the first innings, the way we got all out, it was looking difficult for us to come back. Wonderful. Special knocks from tail-enders also. Amir showed resilience. That was a superb knock from Shafiq. I'm happy and proud the way we played in the fourth innings. I always believe in this team, that's why we've been performing well in the last six years. All individuals can give you something special. We knew Yasir can chip in and he can help Shafiq. Even when Shafiq got out there was hope. After what we showed in the last couple of days, everyone believes, the team more than anyone else
Steven Smith: "Lost all my fingernails. some game of cricket, wasn't it. Asad played an unbelievable innings. Was hardwork. Lot of credit to the way they played. Our quicks kept coming back, that wicket showed the class of Starcy. You've always got hope, one wicket away. They didn't give us a sniff until the end. Wouldn't have enforced the follow-on, to give our bowlers a rest. We've seen in day-night Tests, wickets fall under lights with the new ball. I'm sure the ratings would have been amazing as well. Nice to hit 'em, not sure what Yasir was doing there.:
Peter Handscomb: "Was pretty tight there toward the end. No such thing as an easy win. They really fought hard. Plenty of chat. We knew we were one wicket away from sealing it. Was all about the processes. Shafiq stuck to his guns, nearly got their team over the line."
Mitchell Starc: "They played really well to score that total on the backend of the game. We knew if we got one, we'd eventually get the other. Hard toiling for us. A bit stiff and sore for the night. Long night, didn't get to bed till 1.30 - 2 o'clock. The ball went soft rather quickly, a bit of hard work towards the end. They've gusted it out and credit to them.
144.6;W;Starc to Yasir Shah, OUT that's the end of the Test match. A lackadaisical way to end the game. The umpire gives him out on the field. A yorker on off and middle, Yasir outside-edges his flick to Smith at second slip. He is so disappointed with his shot that he continues to look at his partner in search of an impossible run. Smith, though, is quick on it and effects a direct hit at the striker's end. Yasir was just a few metres away from his crease, but failed to get his bat down in time. Australia celebrate in a huddle. Jubilant scenes.;Yasir Shah run out (Smith) 33 (108m 66b 4x4 0x6) SR: 50;
144.5;?;Starc to Yasir Shah, no run clears his front leg and looks to mow the ball over midwicket. The line was far too wide outside off to play that shot;
144.4;1;Starc to Rahat Ali, 1 run 146 kph, Starc won't be too happy with that. Strays on the pads and clipped to square leg;
144.3;?;Starc to Rahat Ali, no run 145 kph, bouncer to start on leg. Rahat watches it and avoids the ball with a duck.;
144.2;W;Starc to Shafiq, OUT snorter from Starc. And Australia strike. Is that the delivery that changes this Test match? The front foot is fine. Australia are pumped. Goes wide of the crease from around the wicket and directs his bouncer at Shafiq's badge. The key to that delivery was the length. It wasn't pitched too short. More a back of a length, but he was aided by the bounce in this pitch. Shafiq felt he can play instead of duck. It takes the glove and shoulder of the bat and lobs to Warner at gully who backtracks, takes a two-handed overhead catch and throws the ball miles in the air. Sensational delivery to end an even better innings. Fantastic stuff from Shafiq.;Asad Shafiq c Warner b Starc 137 (336m 207b 13x4 1x6) SR: 66.18;
144.1;1;Starc to Yasir Shah, 1 run 149 kph, a yorker on off. Yasir jams his bat down and gets one to cover.;
143.6;4;Hazlewood to Shafiq, FOUR runs through gully and Pakistan get four closer. Short and wide, poor ball. The field was brought up too. Shafiq lays into his cut and gets this behind point for four;
143.5;?;Hazlewood to Shafiq, no run just past the bat. 132 kph. Full delivery on a sixth-stump channel, the ball holds its line and beats the bat. Just natural variation;
143.4;?;Hazlewood to Shafiq, no run shortish and wide outside off, 138 kph. No stroke;
143.3;1;Hazlewood to Yasir Shah, 1 run good delivery. Full and straight, a low full toss. Worked away to square leg for one;
143.2;1;Hazlewood to Shafiq, 1 run full on middle and leg, nudged away to mid-on. in the air and just wide of Renshaw at midwicket. Pressure increasing;
143.1;?;Hazlewood to Shafiq, no run that looks closer than the previous one. Huge appeal. No, says umpire Illingworth. Australia don't review. only question is height. Yes, it's missing the stumps. Fullish on off, nips back in and strikes Shafiq in front of middle.;
142.6;?;Starc to Yasir Shah, no run byes? Short delivery down leg, bounces well in front of Wade and he parries his collection to fine leg. They don't take the run;
142.5;?;Starc to Yasir Shah, no run 150 kph, full and straight, defended back. Starc finding his rhythm now;
142.4;?;Starc to Yasir Shah, no run back of a length outside off, 141 kph. Got on top of the bounce and played it down;
142.3;?;Starc to Yasir Shah, no run 146 kph, full delivery outside off, sixth-stump line. Moves away too. Yasir misses his drive by a distance;
142.2;?;Starc to Yasir Shah, no run grazes the pad. 147 kph, Yasir misses his flick and Wade doesn't collect cleanly. There is a bit of bat too, would have been out had Wade caught that;

141.6;1;Hazlewood to Yasir Shah, 1 run a full toss on middle, worked to square leg for one. Some inward shape;
141.5;?;Hazlewood to Yasir Shah, no run given! Yasir reviews. All this needs to do is clip the stumps. That does not look out. Back of a length delivery outside off, nips back in. Yasir offers no stroke and is struck outside the line, redundant because he left the ball. Two greens on HawkEye, the most significant one being the impact on stumps, which showed the ball bouncing over the stumps. Umpire Illingworth got that wrong;
141.4;1;Hazlewood to Shafiq, 1 run dabbed down to third man. One more;
141.3;3;Hazlewood to Yasir Shah, 3 runs dropped? Definite chance. Full and wide outside off, Yasir slices the ball off the outside half the bat. Lyon jumps and to his left, and hardly gets a hand on it. His hands were just not in the right place. I've seen tougher taken with more ease. Should have been taken at this level;
141.2;?;Hazlewood to Yasir Shah, no run on the pads, nudged to square leg;
141.1;?;Hazlewood to Yasir Shah, no run full and well outside off, Yasir lets it go;

135.4;4;Bird to Yasir Shah, FOUR runs edged but there is no fielder at second slip. This is excellent bowling from Bird. bowls it full just outside off, Yasir gets a thick outside edge and it flies through third slip.;

125.4;?;Hazlewood to Yasir Shah, no run 139 kph, driven to mid-on;

125.2;1;Hazlewood to Shafiq, 1 run 132 kph, full outside off, skewed to deep point off the outside half. They take the run off the second ball;
125.1;?;Hazlewood to Shafiq, no run 136 kph, full and tailing back in, clipped to a midwicket;

122.4;4;Bird to Yasir Shah, FOUR runs Yasir now starts brightly. Gets a full delivery on middle, Yasir whips that through midwicket with elegant ease;
122.3;W;Bird to Wahab Riaz, OUT and taken. The tentativeness of the final over has caused Wahab's dismissal. A good length delivery outside off, Wahab comes forward but is then pushed back by the shorter length. He offers a loose waft at the ball, a thick outside edge flies low to Smith's left at second slip. He dives and hangs on this time.

120.2;1;Lyon to Shafiq, 1 run worked to midwicket;

119.2;?;Hazlewood to Shafiq, no run a fuller ball close to off stump, Shafiq stays on his crease and defends a touch awkwardly, that was a slower cutter from Hazlewood;
119.1;?;Hazlewood to Shafiq, no run a length ball outside off, Shafiq stays back and punches it into the covers;

118.5;?;Lyon to Wahab Riaz, no run strides forward and defends one watchfully this time;
118.4;6;Lyon to Wahab Riaz, SIX runs whoa! How's that for a slog sweep! Down on one knee, a big wind up and a smashing swing of the bat, lofting the ball miles towards deep midwicket, clearing the boundary with ease;

117.6;?;Hazlewood to Wahab Riaz, no run shoulders arms to a good length ball outside off stump;
117.5;?;Hazlewood to Wahab Riaz, no run is that lbw? Is that caught and bowled? The umpire - Richard Illingworth - says no to both, and Australia review. Wahab came forward and played across the line to a good length ball that angled in to him. The ball lobbed off the pad towards the bowler and Hazlewood ran forward and dived to catch it. No inside edge or glove, so the catch is not out. Ball tracking shows the ball would have missed leg stump. No luck for Australia on the lbw either.;
