Data
What an amusing end to a very destructive Australia innings. Before those five wickets in six balls Australia ran rampant, first Watson and then David Hussey powering the ball around mercilessly. It would take something quite special for Pakistan to climb this mountain.
I can't get over how odd that final over was, excellent bowling suicidal running. But when you lose five wickets in an over it should spell disaster, but in this case it barely matters at all. It will make a good quiz question at some point I'm sure.
Australia have had a torrid outing at the last two World Twenty20 tournaments but have made a very strong opening statement here. Now they unleash their battery of pace bowlers, how will Pakistan respond?
19.6;W;Amir to Tait, OUT gone this time! Bowled him! How utterly extraordinary and bizarre. Decent length and line, Tait gives himself room and it cannons off his pads on to off stump. So we have a five-wicket maiden, yet Australia are completely on top.;Shaun Tait b Mohammad Amir 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
19.5;?;Amir to Tait, no run ooh, this time they reject the bye, Tait plays and misses haplessly at a good ball outside off, but stands his ground imperiously;
19.4;W;Amir to Nannes, OUT well, what have we here!? Is it four in four!? Another yorker, another swish, another attempted bye, and yes, another run out.

19.2;W;Amir to Johnson, OUT Aamer strikes! Lovely yorker and Johnson can't get his bat down in time, it crashes into middle stump, lovely bowling;Mitchell Johnson b Mohammad Amir 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
19.1;W;Amir to Haddin, OUT gone! No mistake from Sami at short third man, it was full and outside off, Haddin throws his hands at it, gets an edge and neatly taken.

Hello and welcome to what should be a thrilling Australia v Pakistan encounter in St Lucia. Pakistan may have been royally hammered by Australia recently, but they are the champions of this format and Australia are, well, as far as their record goes, pretty rubbish, but are sure to improve this time round.
I am Sahil Dutta and I'll be bring you all the action from this game, so let's try and get on.
While we wait for the toss I can reel off the few bits I've prepared for today - namely some good links. We have, as ever, our 'lively' Facebook page. Do check it out, and when you do, I desperately implore all of you to play nice, and try talk about the cricket.
For those of you who pretend to have better things to do over the next few hours you can stay updated with our Twitter wicket alerts.
If you find the wealth of stats and my ranting a touch nauseating, you could always jump ship and click here to listen live on our Cricket Radio. Sadly, due to rights issues this service is not available to readers in India, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Er, so, I guess you're stuck with me.
Anyway, enough tattle, we have news from the middle. Australia have won the toss and will bat first. The teams line-up like this:
Australia 1 Shane Watson, 2 David Warner, 3 Michael Clarke (capt), 4 Cameron White, 5 David Hussey 6 Michael Hussey, 7 Brad Haddin (wk), 8 Steven Smith, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Dirk Nannes, 11 Shaun Tait.
Pakistan 1 Salman Butt, 2 Kamran Akmal (wk), 3 Shahid Afridi (capt), 4 Abdul Razzaq, 5 Misbah-ul-Haq, 6 Mohammad Hafeez, 7 Umar Akmal, 8 Fawad Alam, 9 Mohammad Sami, 10 Mohammad Aamer, 11 Saeed Ajmal.
Still no Mohammad Asif, which is a shame, he's always fun to watch, but I'm sure the Pakistan selectors have clear, logical and coherent reasons for everything they do. In David Warner Australia have possibly the most charmless batsman to ever open an innings in international cricket, but his muscular smiting is mighty effective and should provide a fascinating contest against Mohammad Aamer.
Interestingly, after seeing India's spinners profit so much more than South Africa's barrage of fast-medium bowlers, Australia are only playing the Steven Smith. I guess the testosterone-team of Tait, Johnson and Nannes are slightly swifter than Albie Morkel. We shall see.
For now, the players are out there and the fun is about to begin. Warner will face the first ball from Mohammad Aamer.
 Innings Start
Australia came into this tournament with a very poor record but they have outplayed the defending champions in every aspect of the game today. Led by an excellent innings from Shane Watson, supported by the destructive Davids - Warner and Hussey, they made too many for a Pakistan team out of sorts.
Ravi Shastri leads the presentation ceremony and Shahid Afridi said that he thought the spinners could do well early on but Warner and Watson were too strong today and thinks 192 was a very very good total.
Michael Clarke is very chirpy. Predictably he thinks 'all the boys did well' and backs his fast bowlers to do very well in the tournament.
Shane Watson takes the man-of-the-match award for his 81 that really took the game away from Pakistan. He says 175 would have been par today and pays tribute to David Hussey's fifty.
Right, that is all from me. I hope you have enjoyed the action. The fun, of course, doesn't stop and tomorrow Sri Lanka face a combative Zimbabwe side and need to win to progress in the tournament, and England play their first game, against the hosts, West Indies. So I do hope you'll join us, and, while you wait, you can always share your rants and revelations on our Facebook page.

14.5;W;Nannes to Abdul Razzaq, OUT Nannes gets another, and Razzaq departs. That may be it for Pakistan. Full and straight, Razzaq tries to thrash it over long off but doesn't get nearly enough of it and Warner catches it on the boundary;Abdul Razzaq c Warner b Nannes 1 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
14.4;1;Nannes to Misbah, 1 run full again from Nannes, Misbah chips it down to long on, one bounce, for another single;
14.3;1;Nannes to Abdul Razzaq, 1 run Razzaq needs to do something special but at the moment all he can do is push this into covers for one;
14.2;1;Nannes to Misbah, 1 run gets a run this time, full and squeezed into the covers for one;
14.1;?;Nannes to Misbah, no run Misbah steadily works this away calmly, Pakistan need more but maybe he's timing his innings well;
13.6;W;Tait to Afridi, OUT all over now! Full and Afridi attempted to thrash it away but it came off the pads and cannoned on to the stumps, very ambitious shot that didn't come off;Shahid Afridi b Tait 33 (21m 24b 3x4 1x6) SR: 137.5;
13.5;2;Tait to Afridi, 2 runs full toss here from Tait, it looked quite high, Afridi ended up clubbing it down to long on for a couple, Afridi thought it was a no-ball, but the umpire disagreed;
13.4;?;Tait to Afridi, no run good bouncer here, very sharp, Afridi threw everything at a pull shot but it was through him in a flash;

13.2;1;Tait to Afridi, 1 run slower ball from Tait, Afridi hoiks madly at it, swinging himself off his feet, but doesn't time it and collects one to midwicket;
13.1;1;Tait to Misbah, 1 run Misbah is once again content to work the powerhouse Tait down to third man for a single, to set up a manic looking Afridi v Tait clash;
12.6;2;Johnson to Afridi, 2 runs good end to an excellent over from Johnson, full and straight Afridi drives down to long off and collect a lung-busting couple;
12.5;?;Johnson to Afridi, no run good from Johnson, slower ball that Afridi didn't spot at all, ends up fencing at it outside off stump and misses;

12.3;2;Johnson to Misbah, 2 runs not great fielding this from Tait, Misbah worked a leg-side ball down to short fine leg where Tait tumbled and fumbled and allowed a couple;
12.2;1;Johnson to Afridi, 1 run this was much more in Afridi's hitting arc, on a length and outside off, but he could only drive it down to the deep cover fielder;
12.1;?;Johnson to Afridi, no run Johnson is back, replacing Smith after that expensive last over, Afridi is already in more trouble, swishing wildly and missing outside off;
11.6;1lb;Watson to Afridi, 1 leg bye Afridi down on one knee again, this is well outside off stump though, so the leg-side scoop is harder to pull off, as it is, it comes off the boot into the off side where Haddin fields;
11.5;1;Watson to Misbah, 1 run Misbah rotates the strike calmly here, driving towards deep cover to get his captain back on strike;
11.4;1;Watson to Afridi, 1 run well he's swinging hard at it, but not really timing this length ball, gets it down to mid on for one;

9.6;1;Johnson to Afridi, 1 run gets more bat on this, but not much more, leading edge loops down to mid off;
9.5;?;Johnson to Afridi, no run well, if Afridi did connect with this it would have ended up well out the ground, as it was, he swished manically at thin air as a full ball passed through to Haddin;
9.4;2;Johnson to Afridi, 2 runs looked like a slower ball from Johnson, it was short, Afridi hung back and tried to mow it away through midwicket, couldn't time it at all and collects a couple;
9.4;1nb;Johnson to Afridi, (no ball) no ball from Johnson, outside off, which Afridi plays and misses at, but excitingly this means it's a free hit;
9.3;1;Johnson to Misbah, 1 run fuller this time outside off stump, Misbah drives carefully, but it comes off the edge anyway and goes down to third man;
9.2;1;Johnson to Afridi, 1 run good ball on a good length, Afridi gets back and defends into the off side, collects a single;
9.1;?;Johnson to Afridi, no run Johnson back to Afridi, and he's so excited that he falls over as he delivers, it's still a good ball and beats an attempted defensive shot from Afridi;
8.6;2;Smith to Misbah, 2 runs better connection this time, swiped away towards cow corner for a couple;
8.5;?;Smith to Misbah, no run fullish delivery Misbah can't get much of it and another dot;
8.4;1;Smith to Afridi, 1 run Afridi sweeps his first ball, timing it well enough but straight to the fielder on the midwicket boundary;
8.3;1;Smith to Misbah, 1 run short ball to Misbah, pulls it away for a single to deep midwicket;
8.2;W;Smith to Umar Akmal, OUT oh dear, all over for Umar, this time giving himself room and swiping at it horridly outside off stump, ends up slicing it to Hussey at deep point who juggles before securing the catch;Umar Akmal c Hussey b Smith 18 (21m 14b 0x4 1x6) SR: 128.57;
8.2;1w;Smith to Umar Akmal, 1 wide another attempted dab shot, to what would have been a full toss, so Umar ends up getting nothing from a loose ball;
8.1;2;Smith to Umar Akmal, 2 runs Umar greets him with a delicate sweep, bit of a nothing shot, dabbed away to short fine leg for a couple;

6.6;1;Hussey to Misbah, 1 run this time he stands up and pushes it down the ground for a single;

5.4;1;Watson to Umar Akmal, 1 run this time it's just a single, worked away into space;
5.3;6;Watson to Umar Akmal, SIX runs on a length and Umar has brilliantly smashed this, timed perfectly over the midwicket boundary where a policeman sticks out a hand and takes it easily in the stands, top shot;

4.4;1w;Johnson to Misbah, 1 wide bonus run here for Pakistan, and they will need plenty more, shoved down the leg side;
4.3;1;Johnson to Umar Akmal, 1 run good ball this, outside off and Umar opens the face, guiding it away for a bristling single down to third man;
4.2;W;Johnson to Hafeez, OUT well that's the end for Hafeez. Short and pulled firmly, actually timing it very well, but straight to Hussey at deep square, pretty tame end really, and things are in danger of unravelling here;Mohammad Hafeez c Hussey b Johnson 12 (19m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 85.71;
4.1;1;Johnson to Umar Akmal, 1 run Mitchell Johnson is the new man, and he's pretty swift too, arrowed in on to middle and worked away for a single;

Similar to the last ball, Butt trying to give himself room, Tait follows him with a bouncer, the attempted pull this time gets high on the bat and loops gently to Hussey at mid on, Pakistan in real trouble;Salman Butt c Hussey b Tait 15 (18m 10b 3x4 0x6) SR: 150;

2.6;?;Nannes to Hafeez, no run good ball to finish a damaging over, Hafeez works it from middle to midwicket;
2.6;2w;Nannes to Salman Butt, 2 wide looks like Butt may have briefly rattled Nannes here, who shoves this well down the leg side for a wide, Haddin can't collect so they run an extra;

1.5;?;Tait to Hafeez, no run touch shorter this, and Hafeez just flinches at it outside off, nothing shot, and it zips through to Haddin;
1.4;?;Tait to Hafeez, no run strange shot this from Hafeez, attempting a drive on the up from this back of a length delivery outside off stump, can only find fresh air;

0.1;W;Nannes to Kamran, OUT well, you get a sense this could fizzle out too quickly, Pakistan need almost 10 an over, this is full outside off, Akmal clears his front leg and slices it away off the outside edge down to Steve Smith on the third man boundary, who snaffles it easily enough;Kamran Akmal c Smith b Nannes 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
0.1;1w;Nannes to Kamran, 1 wide starts with a wide, swinging down the leg side, Akmal misses his leg-side flick and Pakistan are off;
