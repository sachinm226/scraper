Australia lose their last five wickets for 33 but they have a very good total after being put in. It was set up yesterday by Marnus Labuschagne and Steven Smith then taken on today by Travis Head and Tim Paine. "It's pretty cool," Head tells Fox Cricket. "Nice to go on with my start." New Zealand will have, I think, 21 overs to face tonight. That will be very tough. Alex will be with you for the start of the innings

It balloon up off the arm guard and popped high to Head at leg gully. The question is did it touch the glove before hitting the arm guard. Very tough to tell. It may have hit the sweatband of the glove which counts as part of the glove. The third umpire is taking his time. Not enough evidence! The third umpire stays with Erasmus' decision!;
36.2;?;Starc to Santner, no run 144kph, back of a length wide of off, he leaves;
36.1;W;Starc to de Grandhomme, OUT caught in the gully! That was inevitable.
