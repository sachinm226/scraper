1735hrs AO is frustrated with Channel 9. He writes: "Can you believe channel 9 in Melbourne cut to the news 2 balls from the finish with Gul on a hatrick!!!" Anyway Channel 9's loss is Cricinfo's gain.
So in an innings where for the first 45 overs no team had the clear upper hand - Australia never ran away nor got bogged down - Pakistan wilted in the last five overs, the batting Powerplay. As a result, they are chasing an imposing 287. Join us for the chase, in about half an hour.
49.6;1;Umar Gul to Haddin, 1 run Haddin looks for a scoop over fine leg, Gul is fast and wide of off, and Haddin just makes a limp connection and gets a single;

49.4;W;Umar Gul to Clarke, OUT he is on a hat-trick, would you believe it? Last over he bowled three back-to-back no-balls, and here he has both the settled batsmen in two deliveries.

Pakistan have their counter-injury too: Mohammad Aamer is out with the groin injury, but thankfully Mohammad Asif has recovered from his hand trouble. They have also got Fawad Alam in for Shoaib Malik. We begin in 20 minutes
1320hrs It's Australia Day, and it's becoming a bit of an Australia Day tradition for Australia to be playing an ODI in Adelaide. They will want to prevent a repeat of last year's happenings. More importantly, Pakistan will want to prevent a repeat of the first two matches, and keep the series alive by winning this match. More than 17,000 at the Adelaide Oval saw a one-sided Big Bash final three days ago, they'll want something different too. Hello and welcome to the Cricinfo's live coverage of the third ODI. I am Sidharth Monga, I'll be calling the game, and Sanjay Murari will keep the scores. We'll bring you the toss news soon
 Innings Start

Thanks for joining us, okay bye
