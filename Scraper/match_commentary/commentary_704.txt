Data
Australia have set India yet another 300-plus target. They've scored 317 for 8 thanks to a century from Symonds. He scored an unbeaten 107 off only 88 balls. The Indian new ball bowlers started poorly, conceding over six an over yet again, and Sreesanth compounded the problems by dropping Symonds when he was on 2. Dravid too reprieved Gilchrist and even though the spinners pulled things back a fraction in the middle overs, Symonds was able to accelerate tremendously towards the end.
Kanishkaa will be back at 1.15pm local time for the Indian chase.

Toss and teams: Ricky Ponting has called correctly and Australia will bat first. Matthew Hayden will sit out because of the hip injury he sustained and Brad Haddin replaces him.
For India, Sreesanth replaces RP Singh. Mahendra Singh Dhoni reckons the pitch will assist spin from the first ball .... well... and that it would get slower and lower as the day progresses. Indian supporters would hope all his predictions are wrong as it seems like Australia have everything to gain by choosing to bat and make best use of this surface.
Pitch: Nagpur has often produced belters and this is no different. It's flat, devoid of grass and all we can see is runs, runs, and more runs. It's not surprising that Ponting chose to bat. India opened the bowling at Vadodara with Harbhajan Singh so it will be interesting to see if Dhoni repeats that here.

Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the sixth ODI between India and Australia in Nagpur. This is Kanishkaa Balachandran starting off with the commentary. George Binoy will join you later.
This match is like a virtual final for India as they have to win here and the next one to prevent Australia from running away with the series trophy. Australia, meanwhile, don't have to change anything. They're going along just fine and the psychological damage they inflicted in Vadodara may just be enough to clinch the series here. We'll bring you the toss and pitch shortly. You may read the preview of this match by Anand Vasu.
 Innings Start
The Australians celebrate in a huddle on the field while Zaheer and Harbhajan wait to shake hands. Symonds is the center of most celebrations and justifiably so for he's had an outstanding match. He scored 107 off 88 balls to lead Australia to 317 for 8 and then bowled 10 overs for 39 runs while Tendulkar and Ganguly were in the middle of a solid partnership.
Australia have an unattainable 4-1 lead with a dead rubber to play in Mumbai. India were in with a strong chance after a superb start to the run-chase. It was the period between overs 35 and 42 where they scored only 22 runs in seven overs that the chase lost direction and momentum and that's all that Australia needed to close out the game.
Andrew Symonds is the Man of the Match, they haven't announced it yet but I'm taking the liberty of jumping the gun. Ricky Ponting is incredibly pleased with the victory because India isn't an "easy place to play cricket". He says that Andrew Symonds is playing "unbelievable cricket" at the moment and credits Brad Hogg for his spell of 4 for 49 too.
That's all we've got for you today, thank you for your attention. On behalf of Kanishkaa as well, this is George Binoy signing off. Cheers.

We're all set to resume now for India's reply. It's kind of like default mode in this series - India constantly having to plan for a 300+ chase. A big score is due from Rahul Dravid
and he's in a venue where he's rarely put a foot wrong as a batsman. Remember, India have to win here to make the final ODI in Mumbai just a little interesting.
Lee has the new ball. Ganguly to take strike. Two slips in place. ON ON
