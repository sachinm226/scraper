Data
6.37pm What a stunning opening salvo to the Ashes. Australia were dead and buried at 122 for 8 ... but Smith found resolute support from Peter Siddle and Nathan Lyon, to climb back onto the offensive with an outstanding 144 from 219 balls. Australia's 284 is worth nearer 450 given their back story. And there will be about ten six minutes for their day to get even better against England's ropey top order ... don't go away!
Arch: "Gadzooks! Somebody fetch Jack Leach!!" Too right, this situation is made for him. Wonder if anyone else will have the honour of nightwatching?



80.4;W;Broad to Smith, OUT bowled him! Broad has his five-for, richly deserved, but it's all about Smith... he was aiming for quick runs, trusting his eye, but this time, the late tail into the toes was too good for the honk across the line. Smith was sprinting off the pitch as soon as his timbers were rattled. He wants to get England out there pronto!;Steven Smith b Broad 144 (336m 219b 16x4 2x6) SR: 65.75;
80.3;?;Broad to Smith, no run decent yorker, comes out as a full toss, but swings in late towards the toes as Smith presses down the ground;
80.2;?;Broad to Smith, no run fuller length, wide outside off, Broad goes for the one-day wide yorker. Smith can't lay bat on it;
80.1;6;Broad to Smith, SIX runs swung lustily over cow corner! That is contemptuous! And I wonder if it might provoke Broad to call for the new nut ... nope, not yet ...;
79.6;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run slower ball, very full. Poked to point;
79.5;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run back of a length, curling away from the stumps as Lyon curtain-rails inside the line;
79.4;4;Woakes to Lyon, FOUR runs pounded through long-off! There are the benefits of getting right behind the line. Every now and again you'll be in the perfect position for a Kodak-moment drive!;
79.3;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run tight to off stump, back of a length, solid on the back foot;
79.2;1;Woakes to Smith, 1 run angled down to third man, that was an easy two, but Smith slipped when turning ... another opening for England;
79.1;?;Woakes to Smith, no run slower ball, and Smith is almost castled! A massive wind-up, but the ball hops obediently over the middle stump, like a Shetland Pony at a horse show;
78.6;?;Broad to Lyon, no run leaning forward, pushed to cover off the front foot;
78.5;?;Broad to Lyon, no run resolute in defence once more;
78.4;1;Broad to Smith, 1 run retreating to the leg side once again, can't get this one away;

78.2;?;Broad to Smith, no run retreating to the leg side, Broad chases him with the short one as he defends;
78.1;?;Broad to Smith, no run defended on the back foot, firmly into line;
49.6;?;Stokes to Siddle, no run it was certainly fuller, and it was a jaffa! Zips past the outside edge as Siddle presses forward uncertainly from the crease;
49.5;?;Stokes to Siddle, no run another bouncer, another duck. Siddle being set up for the yorker?;
49.4;?;Stokes to Siddle, no run bouncer. Siddle ducks easily enough;
49.3;?;Stokes to Siddle, no run inswinger, well directed, but eased to cover with a solid full face;
49.2;?;Stokes to Siddle, no run outswinger on a full length, three slips and a gully lurk as Siddle pokes to point;
49.1;1;Stokes to Smith, 1 run cracked hard into the covers, and surprisingly Smith takes the single. A chance for England now ...;
48.6;2;Woakes to Siddle, 2 runs elegantly done, leaning into a compact drive and picking the gap in the covers. Placement over power, which is prudent in the circumstances;
48.5;1;Woakes to Smith, 1 run a firm prod around the corner, meeting the full length with a closed face and urgently looking for the second. It's not on, so one ball for Siddle;
48.4;?;Woakes to Smith, no run inside-edged defence, down into the crease;
48.3;?;Woakes to Smith, no run tickled up to mid-on;
48.2;?;Woakes to Smith, no run keeps a fraction low on an off-stump line, but Smith is watchful and stabs to midwicket;
48.1;2;Woakes to Smith, 2 runs on the back foot, picks the gap in the covers with a firm drive and two is the immediate call;
77.6;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run pushed onto the back foot to defend in front of off stump;

77.4;?;Woakes to Smith, no run banged in short, through to the keeper as Smith ducks;
77.3;?;Woakes to Smith, no run inswinger, Smith gives himself room with a stride to leg and drives into the off side;
77.2;?;Woakes to Smith, no run rolls the fingers, a slower ball outside off, pressed into the covers;
77.1;?;Woakes to Smith, no run compact punch into the off side, chasing the wide line, but finding the middle of the bat, inevitably. He's seeing it like Jupiter now;
76.6;4;Broad to Lyon, FOUR runs in the air, but Broad can't reach it! Launches himself in the followthrough, but it's just too wide of him, to his left. And rattles through the vacant long off;
76.5;?;Broad to Lyon, no run tapped to point, tighter line, but very solid in defence;
76.4;?;Broad to Lyon, no run outside off, too wide to lay bat on that one;
76.3;1;Broad to Smith, 1 run opens the face on the back foot, dabbed down to third man;
76.2;?;Broad to Smith, no run leaning back for a smack to the off side;
76.1;4;Broad to Smith, FOUR runs pongoed into the crowd at square leg! Moeen doesn't move as he loses sight of it, a filthy hack off the legs, pure hand-eye coordination, one bounce;
47.6;?;Stokes to Siddle, no run there's the inswinger again, he's had good control of that ball in his second spell. But Siddle is alert to the danger;
47.5;1;Stokes to Smith, 1 run fractionally shorter, pulled off the back foot, not timed to midwicket;

46.6;?;Woakes to Siddle, no run right up to the toes, tucked to mid-on;
46.5;1;Woakes to Smith, 1 run back of a length, fenced to backward point and a monstrous volley of boos is evidence that this must be Steve Smith's fifty. What a key knock this is;
46.4;1lb;Woakes to Siddle, 1 leg bye sliding off the pads;
46.3;?;Woakes to Siddle, no run hammers the pad once again, on a leg-stump line, and Joel Wilson says not out;
46.2;?;Woakes to Siddle, no run full length, bending in, poked to the cordon to elicit another massive cheer from the crowd! And curiously, the umpires are taking a look! The soft signal is not out ... they reckon it's a bump-ball ... and it is. Crack on!;
46.1;?;Woakes to Siddle, no run he's got a point you know! first ball, full and straight, thumps the pad... and up goes the finger! But Siddle < b=""> with full justification. A massive inside edge!<>;
45.6;?;Stokes to Smith, no run big inswinger, well played by Smith, watching it like a hawk from the hand and stabbing it into the covers;
45.5;2;Stokes to Smith, 2 runs firmly crunched into the covers, all along the ground to the cover sweeper, and Smith moves along to 49;
45.4;?;Stokes to Smith, no run outside off, through to the keeper from back of a length;
45.3;?;Stokes to Smith, no run through to the keeper again;
45.2;?;Stokes to Smith, no run edged and gone? No! Bemusement all round ... there was a definite noise, was it pad? Ah, bat hit pad. Well played Aleem Dar! That's one back ...;
45.1;4;Stokes to Smith, FOUR runs walks across his stumps, and fences a leg glance inchesout of Bairstow's sprawling reach! Leg slip would have gobbled that!;

44.5;?;Ali to Siddle, no run firm in defence, walking forward to block into the covers;
44.4;?;Ali to Siddle, no run tighter line, harassing the off stump as Siddle blocks to leg;
44.3;?;Ali to Siddle, no run tossed up outside off, threatens to spin as Siddle jabs his bat and pad at the ball;
44.2;1;Ali to Smith, 1 run on the back foot, waiting for the ball to arrive, and pressing the single to deep cover;
44.1;?;Ali to Smith, no run bottom-handed thump to the off side;
43.6;W;Stokes to Cummins, OUT celebrappeal from Stokes! And little wonder! Outswinger, outswinger, outswinger, inswinger! Cummins is done like an Isle of Man Kipper, complete with comfy ice-pillow, as he raises his bat high to be thumped plumb on the knee-roll. Golly, Australia have been as abject as some of the umpiring today! Smith excepted of course ... what can he scrape together now ...?;Pat Cummins lbw b Stokes 5 (16m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50;

42.4;?;Ali to Smith, no run tucked to the leg side;

42.2;?;Ali to Cummins, no run tight and probing on off stump, defended back down the pitch;
42.1;3;Ali to Smith, 3 runs round the wicket, lots of air, and a gentle punch, meeting the full toss with an open face to drill into the covers. Root gathers in the deep, and gestures to the crowd to get rowdier! They aren't letting the side down with their volume as it is...;
41.6;?;Broad to Cummins, no run tailing in towards the off stump, very subtle variation on a theme of straight and straighter. Cummins is wise to it and defends;
41.5;?;Broad to Cummins, no run firm drive, into the covers;

40.1;?;Ali to Smith, no run stretching forward, a lot on the ex-skipper now;
39.6;W;Broad to Pattinson, OUT booming inswinger, obliterating the front pad! Dar gives it straight away, although it may well have been doing too much again... No thought of a review from Pattinson, however, perhaps under orders not to waste it with Smith entrenched. Broad has his fourth and Edgbaston lets rip with another throaty roar! EDIT: That was missing leg!;James Pattinson lbw b Broad 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
39.5;?;Broad to Pattinson, no run round the wicket, pitched up at 85mph as Pattinson steps across and leaves;
39.4;W;Broad to Paine, OUT short ball, Paine pulls - straight to deep square leg! Catching practice for Burns, and Paine is in a world of... well, pain!

35.1;?;Broad to Smith, no run length ball, nipping away as Smith stays back and lets this go;
34.6;W;Woakes to Wade, OUT swinging in, Wade now wears it on the pads... Joel Wilson thinks long and hard before keeping his hands where they are, but now England choose to review, the angle certainly looked good but height is the question. But no! Clattering into the top of middle and off, Wade's comeback is a brief one! And another on-field decision is overturned;Matthew Wade lbw b Woakes 1 (13m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;

33.6;?;Broad to Smith, no run touch shorter, this shapes away outside off, left alone;
33.5;?;Broad to Smith, no run Smith pads up to a nip-backer, and Dar's finger goes up! Smith looks aghast and reviews and it quickly becomes apparent that this was a bad decision, the ball missing the stumps by an inch or so.

33.3;?;Broad to Smith, no run hits a good length on off Smith is well across to block this time;

33.1;?;Broad to Smith, no run fullish and defended softly coming forwards;
32.6;?;Woakes to Wade, no run oooh, bit of nip, clips the outside edge - but short of slip! Stokes was low as it skimmed off the turf and into his calf, nearly two in the over for Woakes;
32.5;?;Woakes to Wade, no run short of a good length, Wade hangs back and defends;
32.4;W;Woakes to Head, OUT straightening on the stumps, Head trapped in front - given! But after a chat with his partner, Head reviews. Was it high? That's about the only thing that could save him... He was stuck in the crease, thumped on the knee roll, and he's not a tall man - smashing middle and off! reckons Hawk-Eye and Head's gotta roll;Travis Head lbw b Woakes 35 (73m 61b 5x4 0x6) SR: 57.37;

31.5;?;Broad to Head, no run good length but again a touch wide, no stroke;
31.4;?;Broad to Head, no run round the wicket, 86mph/138kph and coming back in the channel, not enough to make him play;

23.5;?;Stokes to Head, no run left alone outside off and through to the keeper;

23.3;1;Stokes to Smith, 1 run nudged off the pads to the leg side;
23.2;2;Stokes to Smith, 2 runs short, and pulled with intent behind square. No oomph, but lots of concentration;

22.1;?;Ali to Smith, no run round the wicket, a flogged drive from Smith, but no timing as it dribbles to mid-off;

21.5;?;Stokes to Head, no run better from Stokes, nip off the seam, back into the pads, but clearly going over as the ball deflects into the cordon;
21.4;?;Stokes to Head, no run still three slips for Stokes, as Head clips this one firmly to midwicket;

21.2;3;Stokes to Smith, 3 runs better line from Stokes, but Smith's angles are so acute, deflecting from middle and off, using the angle into the stumps to work the ball fine through backward square. Broad intercepts with a tumble;
21.1;?;Stokes to Smith, no run fired down the leg side, Stokes' radar remains on the blink;
20.6;?;Ali to Head, no run tossed into the toes, clipped hard to mid-on as Head uses his feet once more to take the attack back to the bowler;
20.5;4;Ali to Head, FOUR runs keeps low and snags a fat edge! That's better from Moeen, and the up-and-down gives Head something to think about as the ball skitters to the third man rope;
20.4;4;Ali to Head, FOUR runs too short, Head rocks back with glee, and slashes hard through point. Just a touch of turn but it was academic on that length;
20.3;?;Ali to Head, no run advancing to the pitch, can't get the stroke away;

20.1;?;Ali to Head, no run good areas outside off;

19.3;?;Stokes to Head, no run back outside the left-hander's off stump, no stroke offered this time;
19.2;4;Stokes to Head, FOUR runs too short, and Head seizes on that one, cashing in on the width and crashing a firm pull in front of square;
19.1;?;Stokes to Head, no run through to the keeper, back of a length;
18.6;4lb;Woakes to Smith, 4 leg byes loose from Woakes, hopping onto a leg-stump line, and that's meat and drink for Smith who himself hops inside the line to help it so fine through fine leg;
18.5;3;Woakes to Head, 3 runs flicked with aplomb off the pads as Woakes strays too tight this time. Moeen skitters round to cut off the boundary with a slide;
18.4;2;Woakes to Head, 2 runs tempted by this one, a wider line on a very full length, and a scuffed toe-ended slap to mid-off to get him off the mark in Ashes cricket;

18.2;?;Woakes to Head, no run shoulders arms once more as Woakes ploughs a fourth-line furrow;
18.1;?;Woakes to Head, no run shaping away from the left-hander, and ignored;

17.5;?;Stokes to Smith, no run through to the keeper, fuller length but Smith won't be tempted there;
17.4;?;Stokes to Smith, no run curling away on a wide line, can't reach that one, but this is a Test match, so no wide;
17.3;?;Stokes to Smith, no run sizzling through to the keeper again, back of a length;
17.2;?;Stokes to Smith, no run diligently left alone this time with scarcely a flinch in his stance. Well ... not quite so much of a flinch as usual. It is Smith after all...;
17.1;?;Stokes to Smith, no run that's the length from Stokes, outside off, and bending away this time as Smith chastises himself for having a flirt as the ball zings by;

16.1;?;Woakes to Smith, no run fired through to the keeper;
15.6;?;Stokes to Head, no run that one went the other way! A massive honking leg-side hooper, Bairstow does brilliantly to intercept with one hand at full stretch;
15.5;?;Stokes to Head, no run speared past the leg stump, aiming to swing it away from the left-hander, but not finding the shape from round the wicket;
15.4;?;Stokes to Head, no run round the wicket to mix up the line, and Stokes scrambles his own methods with a wild leg-side fling;

14.4;?;Woakes to Head, no run shoulders arms as Woakes lifts off the deck through to the keeper;
14.3;?;Woakes to Head, no run very full again, tucked to the leg side with a half-cocked prop forward;
14.2;W;Woakes to Khawaja, OUT massive appeal but Khawaja is going nowhere! England are convinced, the umpire is unmoved, England review! There was utter unanimity in the cordon, low-fives from the moment Root signalled for the second opinion, and with good reason! There's the thinnest of tickles, and Khawaja has to walk! Wow. This is getting raucous!;Usman Khawaja c ?Bairstow b Woakes 13 (55m 23b 2x4 0x6) SR: 56.52;

13.4;1;Stokes to Khawaja, 1 run leg-sided once more, flipped round the corner to backward square. Stokes is hooping it but not on the right line to the leftie;
13.3;?;Stokes to Khawaja, no run big appeal from Stokes... but that pitched just outside leg before clattering the pad on a very full outswinging length;
13.2;4;Stokes to Khawaja, FOUR runs slightly leg-sided, swinging back into the pads and tucked square with a measured clip.;

12.1;?;Woakes to Khawaja, no run touch short outside off, Khawaja is into line and lets this one go;

"I find it odd that the English are taking such offence to Paine`s comment on Edgbaston. If I asked anyone to name 5 intimidating grounds in the world, hardly would anyone say Edgbaston. An Aussie Captain (who plays on Gabba, MCG ) least likely so." Okay, that's fair enough, Karthik. But can you name a full 15?
 Innings Start
3.30pm "Woakes and Broad warming up in the middle. No sign of Anderson yet." Melinda Farrell has her binos trained on the outfield... "Looks like Sam Curran is warming up, possibly as sub fielder," Where did he spring from? I thought he was being given a beasting by Tom Banton at Taunton!
3.17pm That will be tea, seeing as the ten-minute turnaround makes a restart a bit pointless. England will settle for their handy lead of 90 ... but they got there in a runabout fashion today, thanks largely to Woakes' unbeaten 37 and a doughty bout of tailend durability from Broad. Nathan Lyon finishes with three wickets, and we can expect him to be right in the thick of things if Australia can give themselves enough runs to defend. This is getting tasty! Back in 15
Donnylad: "The best way to rest Anderson's leg might have been for Stokes, Bairstow and Ali to have worked extra hard to stay in for longer?" Indeed. Not a lot of clues in his body language as he left the field. He tends to look pretty downcast after his dismissals... but who knows, have we seen the last of Anderson in an Ashes contest? Let's hope not.
sheshank: "I bet Starc is sitting at home laughing" I imagine he's sitting in the dressing room scowling...
Jazz: "Sorry, but since when did the umpires start deciding teams don't have to face a tricky 15 minutes before the scheduled break?? Seems quite convenient for Australia." I think it's more about being fair to the paying public... why have 30 minutes of dead action out of 45?



135.5;W;Lyon to Anderson, OUT honked up in the air! A simple catch for Cummins, running in at mid-on to gather the slog sweep, and Australia's long stint in the field is done...;James Anderson c Cummins b Lyon 3 (27m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 15.78;
135.4;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run turn and bounce! Anderson is drawn into the drive, and Lyon's overspin dips on his attempted drive;
135.3;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run flicked off the toes, the man on the sweep is way back. But no single...;
135.2;1;Lyon to Woakes, 1 run ramped over the shoulder once more, Woakes wants the second, but Anderson's mobility makes them settle for one;

134.6;?;Cummins to Anderson, no run head over the ball, pushed into the off side;
134.5;?;Cummins to Anderson, no run tucked off the legs, good contact to backward square, but with one ball to go, Anderson stays put;
134.4;2;Cummins to Anderson, 2 runs finds the gap at backward point, a soft-handed stab outside off, and hoovered up on the boundary's edge;
134.3;?;Cummins to Anderson, no run attacking the stumps, well watched from Anderson, picking the line from round the wicket, and digging out the full ball;
134.2;?;Cummins to Anderson, no run edged, drops short of second slip... looks for a moment as though it would elude the fielder but he drops a hand on it to prevent the run;
134.1;?;Cummins to Anderson, no run a nibble outside off, flat-footed from Anderson;
133.6;?;Pattinson to Woakes, no run short, a wild pull! Some intent at last. Okay, so it was a complete air-shot, but worth a roll of the dice;
133.5;?;Pattinson to Woakes, no run open-faced, attempted glide, digging out the yorker, but can't find the gap;
133.4;?;Pattinson to Woakes, no run fenced down into the cordon with an angled blade as Pattinson targets the top of off;
133.3;4;Pattinson to Woakes, FOUR runs width and slashed! There we go, that's the plan. Get 'em in edged boundaries. Just the one slip, so slash hard enough and you'll get away with it;
133.2;?;Pattinson to Woakes, no run defended back down the track with solid intent;
133.1;?;Pattinson to Woakes, no run elegant drive! Pierces the gap in the covers, and it takes a fine sliding stop from Bancroft to haul back the boundary. There could have been two there if Woakes had been proactive;
132.6;1;Lyon to Woakes, 1 run ramped over the keeper's head! A bit of a tangle of a shot, but he just about gets enough bat on it to jog the single and keep the strike;
132.5;?;Lyon to Woakes, no run fully forward, as Woakes tries to advance but Lyon adjusts his length to demand the defensive push;
132.4;1;Lyon to Anderson, 1 run pumped with intent to deep midwicket, a well-connected slog-sweep, and Anderson is off the mark;

131.5;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run patted to a deep-set mid-on, and still no single! Curious ...;
131.4;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run a firm drill out to deep cover, will they take that single, nope, not yet.;

130.5;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run fired in flat, poked back down the track;
130.4;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run reverse sweep! The 360-degree Burnley Lara unfurls a new trick for an old dog. Doesn't nail it, but good intent...;

130.2;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run probing line from round the wicket, short leg in residence;
130.1;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run tucked off the legs, picked up square;
129.6;W;Cummins to Broad, OUT the short ball does the trick! Broad wasn't comfortable with the angle into the body, a limp flick off the hip as Cummins peppers the ribs again, and it loops tantalisingly down to fine leg. The stand is broken, in the one way that Broad really doesn't fancy any more;Stuart Broad c Pattinson b Cummins 29 (108m 67b 2x4 0x6) SR: 43.28;
129.5;?;Cummins to Broad, no run on the back foot, fenced in front of short leg;
129.4;?;Cummins to Broad, no run short again, Broad isn't so keen to keep his eye on this, as it hops over his shoulder. Sluggish, in spite of Cummins' best efforts;
129.3;?;Cummins to Broad, no run short and sharp, round the wicket, Broad has to hustle as the ball gets big around his lughole;
129.2;?;Cummins to Broad, no run down the leg side;

124.6;?;Smith to Broad, no run past the bat, Paine whips off the bails... but it was a half-hearted appeal, don't think Broad's boot ever left the ground;

110.3;?;Lyon to Woakes, no run clipped off the legs but that's brilliant from Bancroft, tracking the shot as Woakes advanced, and gathering it off the face before shying at the stumps. A direct hit would have been out!;
110.2;?;Lyon to Woakes, no run big turn, wriggles through to slip! But it's come off the thigh, reckons Joel Wilson, and the Aussies reluctantly agree;
110.1;1;Lyon to Broad, 1 run slog-sweep, excellent intent, clawing the ball from outside off. Excellent contact but straight to the sweeper;
109.6;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run right back onto the stumps to defend;
109.5;1;Cummins to Broad, 1 run pressed into the gap once more, on the back foot to point, good manipulation of the field from the big unit;
109.4;?;Cummins to Broad, no run angled bat, squirted to gully;
109.3;?;Cummins to Broad, no run hopping into line on the back foot, poked down into the crease, keeping Bancroft interested under the lid;
109.2;2;Cummins to Broad, 2 runs jabbed down through third man, back of a length, attacking the edge, but he's equal to it this time;
109.1;1;Cummins to Woakes, 1 run nurdled to the leg side, another valuable run to the cause, as an inflatable Donald Trump gets the beers in in the Hollies Stand;
108.6;?;Lyon to Broad, no run a hurried stab on a very full, floaty length, squirted out through backward point;
108.5;1;Lyon to Woakes, 1 run inside-edge into the leg-side but out of Bancroft's reach at short leg! The turn comes into play once more for Lyon...;

108.3;?;Lyon to Woakes, no run big turn down the leg side;
108.2;?;Lyon to Woakes, no run on the back foot, defended into the off-side;
108.1;3;Lyon to Broad, 3 runs a well-executed sweep, hauling the ball from outside off with those long levers, good team-work on the boundary's edge to cut off the four;

107.5;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run back of a length, wafted into the covers with feet still planted in the crease;
107.4;1;Cummins to Broad, 1 run back of a length, fenced off the hip, clean through the now-vacant leg gully!;
107.3;1;Cummins to Woakes, 1 run a curious flappy paddle-pull, hopping to meet the short ball, then slapping down as he ducked, as if waving a napkin at a hornet. Effective enougjh!;
107.2;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run hopping back and across to defend on a middle-and-leg line;
107.1;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run fenced off the back foot, tight line to off stump, and pushed to point;

106.4;1;Lyon to Woakes, 1 run flicked in front of square with a roll of the wrists, an appreciative round of applause from a rather anxious crowd;

106.2;?;Lyon to Woakes, no run turn from back of a length, pushed into the covers;
106.1;?;Lyon to Woakes, no run kneeling out of the crease, pushed to the off side;
105.6;?;Siddle to Broad, no run two slips and a gully as Broad leans forward to defend;
105.5;W;Siddle to Bairstow, OUT slashed to first slip and England are in tatters! Back of a length, a loose half-cocked waft, not a cut, not a drive, not really a shot at all... A simple waist-high catch to Warner's right and this Test has gathered pace somewhat!;Jonny Bairstow c Warner b Siddle 8 (47m 35b 1x4 0x6) SR: 22.85;
105.4;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run fully forward, defended back to the bowler;

105.1;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run angled into the stumps, poked to the off side;
104.6;W;Lyon to Ali, OUT left alone and Lyon plucks out the off stump! That's a terrible misjudgement from Moeen, playing for turn from round the wicket, getting the straight-oner, and a satisfying 'kerplunk' of uprooted stump tells Australia the rest. They are right back in this Test now!;Moeen Ali b Lyon 0 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
104.5;?;Lyon to Ali, no run propping out of the crease once more, and defended, head over the ball;
104.4;?;Lyon to Ali, no run 'urrggh Garry!' is the cry from behind the stumps as Moeen smothers a length ball on off;
104.3;?;Lyon to Ali, no run leg-sided once more, Moeen leans forward to defend;
104.2;4lb;Lyon to Ali, 4 leg byes misdirected first up, sliding into the pads, on the full, tickled very fine, and Siddle trips over his own limbs at fine leg. A bonus for Mo, who does like to get going in his innings;
104.1;W;Lyon to Burns, OUT finds the edge with the quicker ball! That was superb from Lyon, round the wicket, such a tight line to the left-hander, on a full length, and speedy rip off the deck, straightening into Burns' defensive poke, for Paine to do the rest. Excruciatingly tight to the front line, but he's okay. The end of a monster from Burns... but England haven't got the lead they'd have hoped for just yet!;Rory Burns c ?Paine b Lyon 133 (473m 312b 17x4 0x6) SR: 42.62;
103.6;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run thrashed off the back foot, into the covers. Not quite finding his timing today...;
103.5;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run stoutly onto the front foot to block;

102.4;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run shapes to cut but Lyon fires that one in faster and flatter outside off;

101.6;?;Siddle to Burns, no run pitched up, 84mph/136kph and blocked on the bounce to short extra cover;
101.5;?;Siddle to Burns, no run full again, closer to the stumps and he plays this straight towards mid-off;
101.4;4;Siddle to Burns, FOUR runs full, wide and arrowed through cover point! Sweetly struck coming across, took Siddle's bait in reaching for a wide one, but that was middled;
101.3;?;Siddle to Burns, no run touch short on the stumps, tucked down into the leg side;
101.2;?;Siddle to Burns, no run full, 84mph/135kph and tempting the drive, Burns has a whoosh and this one and fails to connect. Plus ca change;

100.3;?;Lyon to Burns, no run tossed up fuller and prodded away;

99.6;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run good carry outside off as Bairstow again thinks about having a flirt;

98.5;?;Pattinson to Bairstow, no run shorter and whipped leg side, again in the air but bouncing in front of midwicket;
98.4;?;Pattinson to Bairstow, no run excellent line, snicks the outside edge... but lands well short of second slip! Think Bairstow angled the bat a touch, but that was nowhere near carrying;
98.3;?;Pattinson to Bairstow, no run comes across on off stump and defends, off the outer half of the bat;
98.2;4;Pattinson to Bairstow, FOUR runs pitched up and cracked through midwicket, uppish but firmly dispatched to the rope;
98.1;?;Pattinson to Bairstow, no run short ball, well-directed and it's deflected through to Paine... half-hearted appeal but Bairstow doesn't look bothered, think that came off the shoulder;

97.2;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run hits a length, 85mph/137kph outside off, Bairstow gets a little front on as he defends;
97.1;W;Cummins to Stokes, OUT short and wide, Stokes cuts... oh, he's nicked it! Stands and shakes his head, the Australians celebrates as one; bit of tepid dismissal, to a ball Stokes will feel should have disappeared through backward point. But that's the breakthrough, and Australia still (just) in front!;Ben Stokes c ?Paine b Cummins 50 (138m 96b 8x4 0x6) SR: 52.08;

96.4;1;Pattinson to Stokes, 1 run full, 88mph/141kph outside off, Stokes bunts it back fine of mid-off and sets off, takes him to a half-century - acknowledged with a raise of the bat and a round of applause from the stands;

93.1;?;Cummins to Burns, no run length ball on the line of fourth stump, defended square;
92.6;?;Pattinson to Stokes, no run very full from around the wicket, Stokes chops down and there's a noise, Paine goes up for the catch behind... but Joel Wilson is unmoved, Pattinson doesn't look too sure, and there's no review. Think Stokes' bat hit the ground;

84.4;2;Pattinson to Burns, 2 runs on the back foot, clipped to midwicket and they gallop back for the second. Stokes nearly took out the umpire and the stumps as he took evasive action from the shy;
84.3;?;Pattinson to Burns, no run back of a length, blocked back down the track;
84.2;?;Pattinson to Burns, no run that's not a wide! Much better length, curling past the off bail from just back of a length;

83.6;1;Cummins to Stokes, 1 run cracked off the back foot to the covers;

83.3;?;Cummins to Stokes, no run utter snorter! Zinging past the outside edge, though Stokes rather helped the situation by sauntering down the pitch to meet the shorter length. Talk about yorking yourself, he jaffa-ed himself there!;

82.3;?;Pattinson to Burns, no run big curling outswinger, Burns plays the initial line and stays out of harm's way;
82.2;?;Pattinson to Burns, no run thumps the pad, and Australia are excited about this! Looked to the naked eye to be pitching outside leg, but it was very full... they opt for the review, with about a split-second to spare. But nope, Joel Wilson got that one spot on... a bit of a gamble there!;

81.1;?;Cummins to Burns, no run still a hint of swing at 83mph, as Burns drives off an inside edge... but he's seen enough. Here comes the new ball;
80.6;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run skids on, and that would have been plumb! A desperate under-edge into the knee-roll saves Stokes!;

80.1;?;Lyon to Burns, no run down on one knee, slapped to the leg side;
79.6;?;Head to Stokes, no run outside leg stump, clipped to square leg. That over went by the the sort of indecent haste usually reserved for Ravindra Jadeja. And now it's new ball time...;
79.5;?;Head to Stokes, no run "bowled heady..."... full length and blocked;
79.4;?;Head to Stokes, no run "yes, Travie..." right up to the toes with a leg-side yorker;

78.3;?;Lyon to Burns, no run better line, more respectful block;
78.2;2;Lyon to Burns, 2 runs spanged over the leg side! Burns treats Lyon with the same disdain that he'd been reserving for Head, and gets away with it, a down-on-one-knee slog-slap to deep midwicket;
78.1;?;Lyon to Burns, no run Garry's back, rejoice. leg-sided from over the wicket, cramped for room;
77.6;2;Head to Stokes, 2 runs pummelled into the covers once more ... as a herd of Flintstones gallop around the Hollies Stand. Yes folks, it's that time of the match;
77.5;?;Head to Stokes, no run short, slow, something resembling turn, Stokes is flat-footed as he attempts a yawning slap;
77.4;1;Head to Burns, 1 run more respectable length, chopped to the off side;
77.3;4;Head to Burns, FOUR runs hits the middle of the pitch like a sack of concrete falling off a lorry, and a toe-ended wallop through deep cover;
77.2;?;Head to Burns, no run flicked off the toes out to the leg side;
77.1;?;Head to Burns, no run toddle, toddle, plop ... nothing wrong with that, a speared dart towards the base of off;
76.6;4;Lyon to Stokes, FOUR runs pre-meditated sweep, and expertly executed, a hint of top-edge but into acres of space behind square, and that trickles all the way to the rope;
76.5;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run defended on the back foot;
76.4;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run shorter, a hint of width, flogged to cover with intent but no timing;
76.3;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run firmly forward, and none-shall-pass defiance;
76.2;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run more pace and bounce, Stokes squares up to block to the off side;
76.1;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run that scuttled from back of a length! Round the wicket, turned and straightened, and zeroed in on Stokes' back pad...;
