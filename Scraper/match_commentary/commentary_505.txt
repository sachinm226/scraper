Data
Brilliant stuff from England who fought back superbly after Watson and Paine added 75. The spinners, led by Swann, were outstanding backed up by Michael Yardy while James Anderson did the late damage. Australia are a side low on confidence and will need a huge effort to save the series with just 212 to defend. Join us in around half an hour at 2.30pm for England's run chase, that's if you can pull yourself away from the other England game today which kicks off shortly. ESPNsoccernet will have full coverage
45.6;W;Anderson to Bollinger, OUT all over! Dead-eye yorker from Anderson as Bollinger backs away to try and go through the off side and the ball strikes bottom of middle. That is that.;Doug Bollinger b Anderson 3 (6m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
45.5;1;Anderson to Tait, 1 run good yorker, dug out towards the keeper and they scamper a single;
45.4;W;Anderson to Smith, OUT another goes! Anderson gets his second as Smith goes for a sweep and is taken on the heel of his back foot which looked in line with leg stump;Steven Smith lbw b Anderson 20 (30m 21b 1x4 0x6) SR: 95.23;
45.3;?;Anderson to Smith, no run brilliant yorker, Smith tried to give himself room but was followed by Anderson;
45.2;3;Anderson to Bollinger, 3 runs he goes over the covers and clears the in field, Luke Wright chases hard and a better throw could have had Bollinger in trouble as he came back for three;
45.1;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run low full toss which is drilled down to long-on...England won't mind that;
44.6;?;Broad to Bollinger, no run short on leg stump, takes Bollinger on the back side as he doesn't play a shot;
44.5;W;Broad to Harris, OUT and that's why it's all short, because it works, as Harris splices an attempted pull and lobs a simple catch Strauss at midwicket who has been in the action today;Ryan Harris c Strauss b Broad 1 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
44.4;1;Broad to Smith, 1 run connects well with this pull but it goes straight to deep midwicket;
44.3;1;Broad to Harris, 1 run back of a length, pulled out to deep square who is quickly in from the boundary;

44.1;2;Broad to Smith, 2 runs short and pulled away through midwicket;
43.6;W;Anderson to Hopes, OUT gone! Anderson strikes with a slower ball which was back of a length and makes Hopes play the pull far too early, resulting in an under edge onto off stump...now it's down to the bowlers;James Hopes b Anderson 7 (13m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 63.63;
43.5;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run stays full and pushed down the pitch, but Anderson fumbles the stop in his follow through and is very annoyed as it gives away a single;
43.4;1;Anderson to Hopes, 1 run another good yorker, this time he manages to work it down to long-on;
43.3;?;Anderson to Hopes, no run excellent yorker, not much Hopes can do except dig it out;
43.2;2;Anderson to Hopes, 2 runs back of a length, worked through deep midwicket and good running makes it into a couple...Australia's 200 is up;

42.5;1;PD Collingwood to Smith, 1 run nice lap wide of short fine-leg;
42.4;?;PD Collingwood to Smith, no run more 'turn' for Collingwood as this beats Smith's flick and takes the pad into the off side;

42.2;1;PD Collingwood to Smith, 1 run dropped into the off side and well run;
42.1;4;PD Collingwood to Smith, FOUR runs there's some aggression as this is heaved from off stump through the leg side and both midwicket and mid-on are inside the circle;
41.6;?;Yardy to Hopes, no run excellent work in his follow through as Yardy dives full stretch to stop a well-timed drive;
41.5;1;Yardy to Smith, 1 run touch too straight and helped into the big leg-side spaces again;

40.4;2;PD Collingwood to Smith, 2 runs worked off the stumps down towards fine leg;
40.3;1;PD Collingwood to Hopes, 1 run opens his account straight away as he punches down to long-on;
40.2;W;PD Collingwood to Hussey, OUT gone and another one departs...Collingwood strikes with an off cutter that scoots through on off stump and beats Hussey's push. That had been coming.;Michael Hussey b Collingwood 21 (25m 21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 100;
40.1;1;PD Collingwood to Smith, 1 run worked off middle into the leg side;
39.6;4;Yardy to Hussey, FOUR runs valiant work from Pietersen on the deep point boundary, but his foot is touching the rope.;
39.5;4;Yardy to Hussey, FOUR runs that's a very tidy stroke, reverse sweep, and picks the gap expertly. Valuable runs;
39.4;1;Yardy to Smith, 1 run;
39.3;1;Yardy to Hussey, 1 run deflected backward of point for another single;
39.2;1;Yardy to Smith, 1 run round the wicket, and looped into the blockhole. Defended to cover;

38.6;?;Swann to Smith, no run tossed up outside off, mistimed drive, and no run there. A superb spell comes to an end;
38.5;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run forward, and defended into the gap at cover for a single;
38.4;W;Swann to Clarke, OUT oh dear, that was out from the moment he went through with the stroke. Done in the flight, and Clarke's uppish drive picks out the sub, Ian Bell, at long-off.;Michael Clarke c sub (IR Bell) b Swann 33 (73m 54b 0x4 0x6) SR: 61.11;
38.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run tossed up, and clipped to midwicket. No liberties on offer at the moment;
38.2;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run chopped out to deep point;
38.1;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run finds the gap for another single;
37.6;?;PD Collingwood to Hussey, no run pre-meditated sweep, but he makes a hash of that. Loud appeal for lbw, but that struck him outside the line again. Still, uncomfortable times for the batsmen;
37.5;1;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run a hint of width, and panned out to point. Australia are content to trade in ones for the moment;
37.4;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run speared into the blockhole, squeezed out to point for another quick single;
37.3;1;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run tossed up, Clarke mets it on the half-volley with some urgent footwork, and clipped to wide mid-on;
37.2;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run outside off, punched into the covers;
37.1;1;PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 run round the wicket, and that was worth an appeal as it was definitely pad first. Just outside the line though;
36.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run good finish to the over. England have got a bit of a stranglehold at present, but as Hussey briefly demonstrated, the shackles can yet be broken;
36.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run forward and defended, back to the bowler;
36.4;1;Swann to Hussey, 1 run forward and blocked to cover;
36.3;4;Swann to Hussey, FOUR runs that's a cracking stroke, a murderous mown slog-sweep, reminiscent of his blows in that epic T20 semi-final;
36.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run pushed right back into the crease, sharp pace;
36.1;?;Swann to Hussey, no run speared down the leg-side, raps the pad;

35.1;1;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run outside off, and slapped to backward point;

34.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run poked uneasily to slip, all along the ground;
34.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run this one turns, straightening on middle stump. Wily work;
34.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run another squeakingly close delivery, outside off, and snaking past the stump as Kieswetter whips off the bails for good measure;
34.2;?;Swann to Hussey, no run round the wicket, and Hussey is in all sorts of trouble, playing for the spin but nearly chopping the straight one onto his timbers;
34.1;W;Swann to White, OUT swept, and snaffled at square leg! A full-blooded stroke, but Strauss scoops the ball low to his left, and that's a key wicket!;Cameron White c Strauss b Swann 12 (23m 23b 2x4 0x6) SR: 52.17;
33.6;1;PD Collingwood to White, 1 run that's a very tidy start, defended back down the pitch;
33.5;?;PD Collingwood to White, no run punched back up the pitch, it ends up clipping the non-striker's stumps, but no danger;
33.4;1;PD Collingwood to Clarke, 1 run looped up, driven calmly to mid-on;
33.3;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run solidly forward, head over the ball, and defended;
33.2;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run tidy line and length, no liberties on offer as yet;
33.1;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run fearsome start! Well, not really, but it's a good stump-to-stump delivery, and Clarke all but chops on;
32.6;?;Swann to White, no run sharp delivery to finish - flatter, faster and tweaking significantly. Defended;
32.5;?;Swann to White, no run big stride forward, blocked with a full face;
32.4;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run quick footwork, and another thumped cut;
32.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run drawn forward, and pushed to mid-on;

31.5;?;Bresnan to White, no run tucked up on leg stump, clipped to midwicket;
31.4;1;Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run stroked out to extra cover.;
31.3;2;Bresnan to Clarke, 2 runs more confident this time, a firm pull to deep midwicket;
31.2;2;Bresnan to Clarke, 2 runs flighty stuff from Clarke. Another swish, and a spiralling top-edge lands safe at backward square;
31.1;?;Bresnan to Clarke, no run back of a length, and that's flat-batted into the covers, and just short of mid-off. Ugly stroke;
30.6;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run rocks back, and plays against the spin to backward point. Tidy bowling;
30.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run solidly forward;
30.4;1;Swann to White, 1 run a nudged single into the leg-side;
30.3;?;Swann to White, no run fully forward and watchfully blocked;

30.1;?;Swann to Clarke, no run tossed up high, and clipped straight to midwicket;
29.6;?;Bresnan to White, no run beaten this time as he tries to drive off the back foot so a good comeback from Bresnan after that early boundary;
29.5;?;Bresnan to White, no run tries to work into the off side but just ends up popping it back towards the bowler;
29.4;?;Bresnan to White, no run driven hard off the back foot but straight back to Bresnan who fields well;
29.3;?;Bresnan to White, no run tucked out to midwicket;
29.2;?;Bresnan to White, no run so close! Bresnan finds the outside edge this time but the ball doesn't quite carry to Kieswetter, much better line and White was trying to fiddle it to third man;
29.1;4;Bresnan to White, FOUR runs and he starts with a short wide ball which is spanked through the off side...not a great start for Bresnan;

27.6;?;Yardy to White, no run fired in quicker, defended to silly point;
27.5;4;Yardy to White, FOUR runs nicely onto the back foot, driven through the off side and the timing is so good that he beats three fielders into the boundary...that was very elegant from a batsman known for brute force;

27.3;?;Yardy to White, no run outside off, defended square on the off side;
27.2;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run worked down to long-on with a whirl of the bat;
27.1;?;Yardy to Clarke, no run down the pitch and defended to midwicket;
26.6;W;Swann to Watson, OUT gone! Swann makes another breakthrough and Watson again can't convert...he tries to turn this into the leg side, it all looks quite innocuous, but some extra bounce meant he just lobs a simple catch to square leg;Shane Watson c Strauss b Swann 61 (107m 76b 5x4 2x6) SR: 80.26;
26.5;2;Swann to Watson, 2 runs quicker this time and too straight, flicked out to deep square and he hurries back for a second;

26.3;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run uses his feet, worked away through midwicket;

25.2;1;Yardy to Clarke, 1 run steps back and cuts through the off side...Clarke is very good and using the crease against spinners;

24.6;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run flicked in the air through midwicket but just wide of the fielder inside the circle;
24.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run more turn for Swann, beats Clarke's defensive push and into the pads;
24.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run down the pitch, Swann responds by dragging the length back and Clarke defends to the covers;
24.3;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run full outside off, heaved through the leg side but doesn't find the gap and picks out deep midwicket;
24.2;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run uses his feet, almost yorks himself and just digs it out down to long-on;
24.1;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run whipped along the ground through midwicket and the deep man is quick to keep them to one;
23.6;?;Yardy to Clarke, no run pushed gently into the leg side;
23.5;1;Yardy to Watson, 1 run latches onto the pull this time, but hits it quite straight and one bounce to long-on;
23.4;?;Yardy to Watson, no run misses out on a pull and is taken on the body;
23.3;?;Yardy to Watson, no run quicker ball and does Watson who has to jab down to avoid being bowled;
23.2;?;Yardy to Watson, no run onto the front foot and defends;
23.1;?;Yardy to Watson, no run good fielding back the non-striker's stumps...that was drilled straight by Watson and crashed into the timbers. Saved four, and also saved umpire Ian Gould from having to get out of the firing line;
22.6;?;Broad to Clarke, no run back of a length, forced into the off side;
22.5;1;Broad to Watson, 1 run nice drive, beats Broad as he dives across but mid-off is up and keeps them to a single;
22.4;?;Broad to Watson, no run good line from Broad, on off stump and Watson is all defence back to the bowler;
22.3;?;Broad to Watson, no run back in his crease, dropped into the off side and backward point is quickly in;

21.6;?;Yardy to Clarke, no run very full, dug out and fielded by the bowler in his follow through;
21.5;2;Yardy to Clarke, 2 runs works this off the stumps and he's placed it well between deep square and midwicket so it allows two;

21.3;?;Yardy to Watson, no run defended down by off stump;

21.1;1w;Yardy to Watson, 1 wide fired way down the leg side;
20.6;?;Broad to Clarke, no run well bowled, but Clarke is easily behind it on his tip-toes and defends by his feet;
20.5;?;Broad to Clarke, no run he's not too comfortable with that one, goes for a pull and it takes his arm then into the body;
20.4;?;Broad to Clarke, no run back of a length, Clarke hops back and defends into the off side;
20.4;1w;Broad to Clarke, 1 wide there we go, the expected bouncer, but it's too short and going down the leg side;
20.3;1;Broad to Watson, 1 run punched down the ground to long-on and there's another fifty for Watson, this time from 54 balls. Now, can he convert one?;
20.2;4;Broad to Watson, FOUR runs handsome...floated up outside off stump, a slower ball and it's driven dismissively through cover. He loves that shot.;
20.1;1;Broad to Clarke, 1 run ooh, well bowled, went for a double bluff and pitched it up...Clarke's footwork not there and he gets a thick inside edge out to deep square;

18.2;W;Swann to Ponting, 1 wide, OUT gone! Huge wicket for England and great work from Kieswetter as this one spins sharply down the leg side, beating Ponting as he comes down the pitch and the wicketkeeper brings the ball back from very wide with the Aussie captain stranded well out of his crease;Ricky Ponting st ?Kieswetter b Swann 3 (17m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 18.75;
18.1;?;Swann to Ponting, no run worked from outside off into the leg side;
17.6;6;Yardy to Watson, SIX runs that goes all the way, too short and Watson had all the time in the world to wait on the back foot and pull it over deep midwicket...a good way for Australia to go to drinks;
17.5;?;Yardy to Watson, no run defended out to midwicket;

16.4;?;Swann to Ponting, no run nicely bowled on off stump, Ponting comes forward and pushes to the leg side;
16.3;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run straighter and Watson goes back to whip this through midwicket;
16.2;4;Swann to Watson, FOUR runs same shot and more reward this time, a little too wide from Swann and it gives Watson the room to tab it fine through third man;
16.1;2;Swann to Watson, 2 runs nicely done, waited for it and opened the face through short third man who makes a good chase and keeps them to two;
15.6;?;Yardy to Ponting, no run outside off, leans forward in defence and pushed into the covers;

15.1;?;Yardy to Watson, no run outside off, chopped down to short third man;
14.6;?;Broad to Ponting, no run full and straight, that's a tidy maiden of the Wag variety, or should I say, Fuf?;

14.4;?;Broad to Ponting, no run drilled into the covers, but can't pierce the field;

13.4;?;Yardy to Ponting, no run wide of the crease again, and played watchfully;
13.3;W;Yardy to Paine, OUT that is absolutely plumb! Paine steps back for a flick through midwicket, but is beaten by the angle from wide of the crease and nailed right in front of middle. That's the breakthrough, and not before time from England's point of view;Tim Paine lbw b Yardy 44 (57m 48b 9x4 0x6) SR: 91.66;

12.3;?;Broad to Paine, no run fuller length, and defended to cover. That's a better length for this wicket;
12.2;4;Broad to Paine, FOUR runs too short, and that's spanked on the up through backward point. Australia are cooking now, and England need to think on their feet, as they did to good effect at Cardiff;
12.1;?;Broad to Paine, no run that one went like an offbreak, and nearly nipped out the off stump. Good delivery;
11.6;4;Wright to Watson, FOUR runs strays onto the pads, and a tidy over is suddenly transformed into an expensive one. Fourteen off the over as that shot fizzes through the gap at wide mid-on;
11.5;6;Wright to Watson, SIX runs slower ball, and that was picked straight from the hand. Watson drops to one knee and mows it over midwicket. Top tonking;
11.4;?;Wright to Watson, no run full stride, and pushed up to cover;
11.3;2;Wright to Watson, 2 runs a desperate gallop as Swann's shy comes in from fine leg. But he's safely home;

9.6;?;Broad to Paine, no run a firm-footed plant, and chipped into the leg-side;
9.5;?;Broad to Paine, no run open-faced steer to point.;
9.4;4;Broad to Paine, FOUR runs down the leg-side again, another four, much finer this time. Poor work from Broad;
9.3;4;Broad to Paine, FOUR runs short and leg-sided, it would have been wide if it had been left alone, but instead it was helped on its way by Paine, who is now flying;
9.2;1;Broad to Watson, 1 run chipped to mid-on, and a scampered single as the shy comes in. Home safe;
9.1;?;Broad to Watson, no run full and straight, punched back down the pitch;
8.6;?;Anderson to Paine, no run outside off, a hint of wobble through the air, defended to point. Another fine over from Anderson, who's been the pick of the attack this morning;
8.5;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run targeting the base of middle stump, but whipped wristily to midwicket for a quick single;
8.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run a hint of width, but carved only as far as point;
8.3;?;Anderson to Watson, no run driven back to the bowler, full and straight from Anderson;
8.2;?;Anderson to Watson, no run punched drive, tidied up by mid-on;
8.1;?;Anderson to Watson, no run tight from Anderson, defended into the gully;
7.6;4;Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs short, and swung away over fine leg. A hint of a top-edge, but they all count. An expensive over, but Paine is up and running, so too are Australia;
7.5;4;Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs down the track, lofted drive, good contact, and mid-on can't get close to that. A third four in five balls;
7.4;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run better this time, tighter line, and respectfully defended;
7.3;4;Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs that's a pie from Bresnan, short and wide, and Paine slams it gleefully through point. A costly over so far;
7.2;2;Bresnan to Paine, 2 runs back of a length, swished through point;
7.1;4;Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs that's a better stroke, as Bresnan serves up another rare half-volley. Good stride, full face, and there's no catching that;
6.6;?;Anderson to Watson, no run a good finish to the over, a big offcutter, and it nearly worms its way through Watson's defences. Nearly, but not quite.;
6.5;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run another single to third man. Just a touch too wide from Anderson, but Australia can't capitalise;
6.4;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run third man is in business again as Watson flashes another single through the cordon;
6.3;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run flashed down to third man, just a single;
6.2;?;Anderson to Paine, no run big inside-edge as Anderson nips one off the seam from a good length. Half an appeal;
6.1;?;Anderson to Paine, no run blocked. Tight bowling from Anderson, no width at all;
5.6;1;Bresnan to Paine, 1 run that's wild, and ugly. A smear over the covers, and he just clears Anderson running back. Bresnan is not impressed, and informs the batsman as such;
5.5;4;Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs that's a good release of pressure. Not a bad delivery, but played firmly on the up, and through the covers;
5.4;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run dabbed into the covers, and another dot ball piles up to keep Paine under the cosh;
5.3;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run Paine goes right back in his crease, and Bresnan follows him with a yorker. Good canny bowling;
5.2;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run forced back into the crease by a tight delivery, back of a length;
5.2;1w;Bresnan to Paine, 1 wide banged in short, too short.;
5.1;1;Bresnan to Watson, 1 run open-faced glide down to third man. Effective use of the width;
4.6;?;Anderson to Paine, no run off-stump lifter. Defended to bring to an end a tidy over;
4.5;?;Anderson to Paine, no run that's an ugly premeditated stroke. Gave himself room and aimed a wild swing through the covers. Anderson held his line and beat the edge;
4.4;?;Anderson to Paine, no run bouncer, and a brisk one. No stroke offered on this occasion;
4.3;?;Anderson to Paine, no run poked into the gully, sharp fielding and a threat of a shy keeps Paine in his crease;
4.2;?;Anderson to Paine, no run tight line, good carry, left alone;
4.1;?;Anderson to Paine, no run drawn onto the front foot, blocked again;
3.6;4;Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs more kick off the turf, but that's misdirected, and helped calmly through backward square leg for another boundary;
3.5;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run right up in the blockhole, and lo and behold, it's blocked;
3.4;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run pushed back into the crease, and defended;
3.3;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run a swished pull, but no contact. Loose again, and loud oohs as Kieswetter gathers;
3.2;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run outside off again, and a loose nibble in response. Nearly an edge;
3.1;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run outside off, through to the keeper;
2.6;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run short, but without the same conviction, and Watson's pull is miscued to midwicket;
2.5;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run the first out-and-out short ball of the game, and it's pulled without total control to deep square. Safe enough;
2.4;?;Anderson to Paine, no run flicked off the hips to backward square;
2.3;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run dabbed down to third man, a decent line once again, but just enough width to open the face;
2.2;?;Anderson to Watson, no run that is a nut. Outside off, kicking off the turf, and just feinting past the edge. Good delivery;
2.1;?;Anderson to Watson, no run outside off, no stroke offered this time;
1.6;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run a touch of width, but no more than dabbed out to point. Another decent over;
1.5;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run another lifter on off stump, angled into the gully;
1.4;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run Bresnan responds by pulling his length back by half a yard. Blocked off the back foot;
1.3;4;Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs too full this time, an easy half-volley, and Paine punches coolly through long-off. Elegant;
1.2;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run outside off, full length again, angled into the gully;
1.2;1w;Bresnan to Paine, 1 wide a bit of a nothing delivery, slipping down leg;
1.1;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run good ball, on off stump, full length;
0.6;?;Anderson to Watson, no run better line and length, drawing a solid defensive block on off stump;
0.5;?;Anderson to Watson, no run zipping off the seam, clatters the thigh pad as Watson aims to flick through square leg;
0.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run that's a good riposte. Yorker, and well dug out;
0.3;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs that's a statement of intent. A fraction too short from Anderson, and no great venom in the delivery. Watson rocks back and clobbers that through midwicket;
0.2;?;Anderson to Watson, no run hurried on middle-and-leg stump, a bit of climb off the seam. Defended easily enough;
0.1;?;Anderson to Watson, no run good length delivery, not a lot of nip, but calmly pushed to mid-on;

10.44am Right, people. It's time to get going. James Anderson has the ball, on his home ground, Watto's on strike ...
10.30am "Fine day here, and a reasonable crowd has been filtering in all morning," reports Brydon. "How many of them will remain when the football starts is anyone's guess. Could be a very big day for the pubs of Manchester." Rest assured, though, Brydon will remain firmly in position. I know which team I fancy to win 3-0 today.
10.20am So, here we go. England have won the toss and put Australia into bat. The home side are unchanged after Michael Yardy pulled up okay from his minor leg injury. Australia have made two changes, with Tait straight into the line-up and Ryan Harris back from his groin strain. Clint McKay misses out along with the now departed Hauritz.
England 1 Andrew Strauss (capt), 2 Craig Kieswetter (wk), 3 Kevin Pietersen, 4 Paul Collingwood, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Luke Wright, 7 Tim Bresnan, 8 Michael Yardy, 9 Graeme Swann, 10 Stuart Broad, 11 James Anderson
Australia 1 Shane Watson, 2 Tim Paine (wk), 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Cameron White, 6 Mike Hussey, 7 James Hopes, 8 Steven Smith, 9 Ryan Harris, 10 Doug Bollinger, 11 Shaun Tait
10.15am This series has certainly been a role reversal from last year with England dominating both contests so far and Australia desperately needing some inspiration. The visitors have a heap of injury problems, the latest being Nathan Hauritz who has flown home and Shaun Tait has been called up.
10.00am Hello and welcome to coverage of the third one-day international from Old Trafford. I'm Andrew McGlashan and will be joined at various stages by Andrew Miller and Liam Brickhill, while we've let our resident Aussie, Brydon Coverdale, head up to Manchester and we await his report of Saturday with interest.
I've heard a rumour that there is another sporting event that could dominate the thoughts of England supporters today, but I can't imagine what that could be and surely there's nowhere else you'd rather be than following this match right here. However, if you do want to follow the football (and I suppose a few of you might) you can head over to ESPNsoccernet which will have all the action.
Those of you in Europe who want to follow the cricket, but unfortunately not the UK, there's ESPN Player which will service all your needs today and for the rest of the English summer.
 Innings Start
That just about wraps things up from us for today. Andrew Miller's bulletin will be ready shortly (he's had a bit of rewrite to do, I know that feeling) and if you want the latest from the football World Cup head over to ESPNsoccernet. Although England have wrapped up this series there are two matches to go, at The Oval on Wednesday and Lord's next Saturday. Join us for them, but from Andrew McGlashan, Andrew Miller and Liam Brickhill it's goodbye for now.
Graeme Swann gets the Man-of-the-Match award for his four wickets. Another impressive day for him. "The last 10 days have been very exciting and on the back of last year when he lost heavily it was important we performed well."
"The dressing room is buzzing and it's a great place to be although it wasn't 20 minutes ago!"
Here comes a smiling Andrew Strauss: "It was pretty horrendous at the end," he says. "We've had a couple of speed humps and today was a major one. Fair play to Tim Bresnan, he kept his head."
"Any series win against Australia is a massive achievement and personally it's a great feeling. But there are areas we can get better and we have two games to go."
Ricky Ponting: "We stuck at it, but the batting wasn't good enough again. Congratulations to England, they have deserved to win each game." He clearly isn't impressed with the batsmen "we haven't stood up" and he isn't a happy Punter. Tait and Bollinger receive praise, as well they should.
England 3 Australia 0. It's not a football score (England would never score that many) and it means the series is in the bag for Andrew Strauss which, despite today's major wobble, is a notable achievement for this evolving one-day side. Credit to Australia, they gave it will go at the end with some outstanding bowling from Doug Bollinger and Shaun Tait with late reverse swing. However, Ricky Ponting will know his team's batting let them down again and 212 wasn't enough. Stay with us for the presentation shortly
49.1;4;Hopes to Bresnan, FOUR runs he's done it...leans back and scythes an edge through the vacant third man area, past the man inside the circle. England celebrate as they secure the series but, boy, they made it tough;
48.6;1;Harris to Bresnan, 1 run and now Bresnan keeps the strike as he drives a single to mid off on the edge of the ring;
48.5;4;Harris to Bresnan, FOUR runs boundary...what a time for it as Bresnan gives himself a touch of room and launches this high over extra cover with enough force to find the rope;
48.4;?;Harris to Bresnan, no run brilliant stuff from Harris, full on off stump and Bresnan can only jab to cover;
48.3;?;Harris to Bresnan, no run low full toss which is slammed straight back to Harris...looks like Bresnan feels he has to do this himself;
48.2;?;Harris to Bresnan, no run full outside off and driven one handed into the covers...can't get any there;
48.1;2;Harris to Bresnan, 2 runs full on the stumps and heaved away through the leg side to huge cheers from the crowd;
47.6;W;Bollinger to Broad, OUT GONE...stunning stuff from Bollinger as he spears a great yorker through Broad who didn't really look like he had a clue out there today;Stuart Broad b Bollinger 0 (3m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
47.5;?;Bollinger to Broad, no run that's a cracker on off stump that lifts past Broad's outside edge...he doesn't look in any sort of form;
47.4;?;Bollinger to Broad, no run goes for the full, swinging yorker and it's turned out to midwicket;
47.3;?;Bollinger to Broad, no run goes for another flamboyant drive...there is no need for that and is so lucky not to get an outside edge;
47.2;?;Bollinger to Broad, no run play and miss first ball! Goes for a drive but it was a half-hearted effort...well bowled;
47.1;W;Bollinger to Swann, OUT GONE! What drama, Bollinger from around the wicket gets one through Swann's defence and crashes into middle stump;Graeme Swann b Bollinger 1 (10m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10;
46.6;1lb;Tait to Swann, 1 leg bye on a length, takes the thigh pad into square leg and Swann keeps the strike;
46.5;?;Tait to Swann, no run full into the pads and into the leg side;
46.4;?;Tait to Swann, no run another huge appeal from Australia, this time as Swann ducks under a bouncer but the umpire says it came off the arm guard;
46.3;?;Tait to Swann, no run targets another yorker and comes out a low full toss which is bunted straight to mid on;
46.2;?;Tait to Swann, no run late swing that beats Swann's drive again and the pace is still up there...danger time for Swann here who likes to play his shots;
46.1;?;Tait to Swann, no run down the leg side, Swann goes for a pull but doesn't make contact but it's not called wide;
45.6;?;Bollinger to Bresnan, no run flicked from middle stump down to mid on;
45.5;1lb;Bollinger to Swann, 1 leg bye huge appeal for lbw! Bollinger was convinced but I think Swann got his foot outside off stump when he was struck on the boot;
45.4;1;Bollinger to Bresnan, 1 run width outside off and driven hard down to third man;
45.3;?;Bollinger to Bresnan, no run that's a beauty, pitches outside off and beats Bresnan's nervous poke through to the keeper...a cracking delivery;
45.2;?;Bollinger to Bresnan, no run full and searching for swing, driven down to mid off;
45.1;?;Bollinger to Bresnan, no run driven straight cover;
45.1;2nb;Bollinger to Swann, (no ball) 1 run full outside off, driven square down to third man...and Ponting had too many men outside the circle so it's a no-ball, too, but no free hit;
44.6;1b;Tait to Swann, 1 bye play and miss outside off, a full ball swings past Swann's drive and Paine can't gather cleaning...Swann only realises late on there's a bye to be taken;
44.5;W;Tait to Yardy, OUT but wickets are an issue! Yardy goes as he chases a full one outside off and gets a thin edge through to Paine. Game on. He hit the ground at the same time, but certainly bat there too;Michael Yardy c ?Paine b Tait 8 (14m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 80;
44.4;1;Tait to Bresnan, 1 run another full, swinging yorker which he digs out right by his feet and they scamper a well-judged single;
44.3;?;Tait to Bresnan, no run goes full this time, swinging in towards middle stump but met with a full face to mid on;
44.2;1;Tait to Yardy, 1 run wide full toss outside and driven out to the cover sweeper;
44.1;1;Tait to Bresnan, 1 run wow, almost strikes with a fearsome short ball that leaps at Bresnan, takes the shoulder of the bat but falls just out of reach of a diving backward point;
43.6;?;Smith to Yardy, no run worked with the spin out to midwicket;
43.5;?;Smith to Yardy, no run pushed back to the bowler;
43.4;4;Smith to Yardy, FOUR runs comes a long way across his crease, exposes all the stumps but gets a little tickle down to fine leg;
43.3;W;Smith to Wright, OUT gone! Well that's a brainless shot from Wright as he tries to clear long off and ends up just giving simple catch to James Hopes. England making it hard work for themselves;Luke Wright c Hopes b Smith 0 (2m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
43.2;?;Smith to Wright, no run flicked straight to midwicket;
43.1;1;Smith to Yardy, 1 run worked from outside off with the spin down to long on;
42.6;?;Harris to Wright, no run forced off the back foot to point;
42.5;W;Harris to Strauss, OUT gone...no century for Strauss as he drives slightly flat-footed outside off and gets a thick edge low to Tim Paine;Andrew Strauss c ?Paine b Harris 87 (182m 121b 8x4 0x6) SR: 71.9;
42.4;1;Harris to Yardy, 1 run opens the face and collects a single to third man...this a chance for Yardy to get a nice not out;
42.3;?;Harris to Yardy, no run worked from off stump down to mid on;
42.2;?;Harris to Yardy, no run finds the outside edge but virtually rolls along the ground to the keeper;
42.1;1;Harris to Strauss, 1 run goes for the pull, doesn't time it out to deep square;
41.6;1;Smith to Strauss, 1 run uses his feet and clips it nicely down the ground;
41.5;1;Smith to Yardy, 1 run onto the front foot, pushed square on the off side;
41.4;W;Smith to Morgan, OUT well, out of nowhere really Morgan has given his innings away rather tame pull to midwicket...soft way to go, but it shouldn't make a difference to the result;Eoin Morgan c Ponting b Smith 27 (49m 35b 2x4 1x6) SR: 77.14;
41.3;1lb;Smith to Strauss, 1 leg bye brings out a reverse hack, not really Strauss's shot and it dribbles to short third-man;
41.2;?;Smith to Strauss, no run spins in towards off stump, defended back to the bowler;
41.1;?;Smith to Strauss, no run down the pitch and worked out to midwicket;
40.6;4;Harris to Morgan, FOUR runs that's an effortless drive from Morgan, was very full outside off and he placed it perfectly through the covers with timing to beat the sweeper;

40.4;?;Harris to Morgan, no run misses a flick to the leg side and is taken on the pad;

40.1;1;Harris to Strauss, 1 run round the wicket and driven square off the back foot to deep point...brings up the fifty stand;
39.6;1;Smith to Strauss, 1 run couple of steps down the track, and nudged to the on side;
39.5;1;Smith to Morgan, 1 run sharp turn again! But this one is just too short, and with the field spread Morgan is in no trouble pushing the ball in the air out to midwicket;
39.4;?;Smith to Morgan, no run there's some turn for Smith as he pitches one in the rough outside off, but Morgan is well forward to smother it;
39.3;1;Smith to Strauss, 1 run pushed out to point and they take a quick single;
39.2;1;Smith to Morgan, 1 run paddle-swept nicely down to fine leg. He was thinking about the reverse-sweep there, but changed his mind when he picked up the line;
39.1;?;Smith to Morgan, no run full and driven to mid-off;
38.6;1;Tait to Morgan, 1 run sharp finish, again back of a length and Morgan hops as he nudges to midwicket;
38.6;1w;Tait to Morgan, 1 wide flung well wide of off stump, that's a big wide;
38.5;?;Tait to Morgan, no run beaten for pace on the pull this time. Again, it wasn't too short but it got up to chest height. Morgan went for the pull but the ball was on to him too quickly and squirted off the toe of the bat to the off side;
38.4;?;Tait to Morgan, no run much fuller this time, Morgan is rushed somewhat in the drive, and the ball rolls to cover;
38.3;?;Tait to Morgan, no run bounce and carry from Tait! That wasn't too short at all, but just leapt up off a length to beat the bat by a good few inches. Paine takes it over his head;
38.2;?;Tait to Morgan, no run bouncer, Morgan ducks quickly underneath it as the ball leaps over the leg stump line;
38.1;1;Tait to Strauss, 1 run on a length outside off, pushed out to deep cover;
38.1;1nb;Tait to Strauss, (no ball) ooh, that could've been nasty! This one slips out of the hand and ends up a beamer, but way outside off. Tait raises his hand in apology;
37.6;4;Hopes to Morgan, FOUR runs cheeky, cheeky innovation from Morgan! He's having fun out there, as he shuffles right across to off and sets himself for the Dilscoop, getting the ball away to the fine leg boundary but he tumbled over in the process!;
37.5;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run cutter, slightly slower through the air, and Morgan nudges to midwicket;
37.4;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run Morgan beaten on the outside edge this time, as he aims to run the ball down to third man but can't get a touch on it;
37.3;1;Hopes to Strauss, 1 run short-arm jab down to wide long-on;
37.2;?;Hopes to Strauss, no run misses off stump by a whisker! That wasn't too short but Strauss was back into an expansive pull. He was beaten on the under edge and the ball whizzed just past the stumps;
37.1;?;Hopes to Strauss, no run tapped to mid off;
36.6;?;Tait to Morgan, no run shorter this time, Morgan taps to cover off the back foot, the ball going too quickly to the fielder for any thought of another quick single;
36.5;1;Tait to Strauss, 1 run more tip-and-run from England, as Strauss this time pushes the ball into the gap at cover;
36.4;1;Tait to Morgan, 1 run slower one, but he's picked it and drops the ball to cover for a sharp single. Good call, Strauss called him through straight away;
36.3;?;Tait to Morgan, no run Tait keeps Morgan on the back foot, as he defends into the off side;
36.2;2;Tait to Morgan, 2 runs Morgan didn't know too much about that one, but they've picked up two! He was aiming to push a length ball into the covers but the ball squirted off the inside edge to midwicket. Acres of space out there, and sharp running brings a second run;
36.1;1;Tait to Strauss, 1 run back of a length just outside off, feisty delivery but it's chopped down just past the diving backward point fielder for one;
35.6;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run straighter this time, and Morgan pushes the ball firmly towards point;
35.5;1;Hopes to Strauss, 1 run again angled down to third man, easy runs;
35.4;2;Hopes to Strauss, 2 runs nicely played, off the face of the bat and intentionally placed very fine towards third man, who runs round but can't negate the second run;
35.3;1;Hopes to Morgan, 1 run nudged down to third man;
35.2;6;Hopes to Morgan, SIX runs what a hit! Where did that come from? Morgan just wondered down the wicket, catching the ball on the half-volley and lifting it easily back over Hopes's head and several rows back into the crowd at long-off.;
35.1;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run tight start, on a length and outside off, angling in and tapped back to the bowler;
34.6;1;Bollinger to Morgan, 1 run short outside off, angled down to third man;
34.5;1;Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run Bollinger fires this one in very full as Strauss shuffles right across to off and clips down to fine leg. It would've been interesting if he'd missed that...;
34.4;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run more back of a length stuff, Strauss hops onto the back foot and taps the ball back towards the bowler;
34.3;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run short again, but wide of off this time and Strauss ducks out of the way this time;
34.2;4;Bollinger to Strauss, FOUR runs short and rearing up to Strauss's grille, but he's in good touch and hooks the ball infront of his face and out to long leg. Great shot, he was in a good position and got a solid connection;
34.1;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run pitching on a length just outside off, and moving away off the seam a touch. Strauss drops the ball defensively towards point;
33.6;?;Harris to Morgan, no run well left by Morgan, as Harris slants one across him;
33.5;1;Harris to Strauss, 1 run leg-stump half volley and Strauss clips easily out to square leg;
33.4;?;Harris to Strauss, no run chopped to point;
33.3;4;Harris to Strauss, FOUR runs hammered. Short, decent pace on the ball but Strauss is just too good on the pull and crunches this authoritatively out to the deep midwicket boundary;
33.2;?;Harris to Strauss, no run back of length, Strauss aims the punch through cover but inside edges onto his thigh pad. That didn't bounce too far from the stumps as it came down...;
33.1;1;Harris to Morgan, 1 run short, but the ball didn't get up very high and Morgan pulls out to deep square leg;
32.6;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run Bollinger pushes Strauss back in the crease to finish, defended to point off the back foot;
32.5;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run speared in at leg stump, this was there to be hit but Strauss couldn't get anything on it and the ball thumps into his pad - was going way down leg so no appeal;
32.4;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run on the spot, pitching just outside off on a length and angling in. Strauss defends to cover;
32.3;2;Bollinger to Strauss, 2 runs angling in to the pads this time and Strauss glances to fine leg's right. As the fielder runs round they push for two;
32.2;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run wide and very short outside off stump, Strauss sways his head out of the way but he needn't have moved. Bollinger lucky not to be called for that one;
32.1;1;Bollinger to Morgan, 1 run rising fairly sharply off a length, Morgan was in some difficulty but managed to keep the ball down as he paddle-pulled to fine leg;
31.6;?;Harris to Strauss, no run very full to finish, Strauss jams the bat down to keep the yorker out;
31.5;1;Harris to Morgan, 1 run full again, wider this time and Morgan drives out to the cover sweeper;
31.4;?;Harris to Morgan, no run driven to mid off, but that hit the bottom of the bat and was trickling along when it reached the fielder;
31.3;1;Harris to Strauss, 1 run punched through the covers off the back foot, and they amble through for one;
31.2;2;Harris to Strauss, 2 runs Harris pulls the length back but pushes this one wide of off and Strauss carves out to deep cover;
31.1;?;Harris to Strauss, no run very full to start, dug out to midwicket;
30.6;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run driven hard on the off side this time, but again he picks out the fielder - at cover;
30.5;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run much fuller this time, Morgan leans forward and tucks to midwicket, but straight to the fielder and hit too well to risk a quick single;
30.4;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run back of a length, outside off and Morgan leaves well alone. That appeared to seam away a touch as well;
30.3;1;Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run flashed square on the up, but the cover sweeper runs round and hurls the ball back quickly;
30.2;1;Bollinger to Morgan, 1 run full and nudged to midwicket, and Morgan is off the mark straight away;
30.1;W;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, OUT Gone! The change works immediately as Collingwood pushes with no great certainty outside off and chops the ball onto his stumps. It was on a length, wobbling around just outside off and he just pushed his bat at it without conviction.;Paul Collingwood b Bollinger 40 (61m 61b 1x4 1x6) SR: 65.57;
29.6;1;Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run tossed up on leg stump, pushed firmly out to deep midwicket;
29.5;?;Smith to PD Collingwood, no run misses out this time as he tries to work into the leg side;
29.4;2;Smith to PD Collingwood, 2 runs drifts outside leg stump and it's nicely paddled way by Collingwood through short fine-leg;
29.3;2;Smith to PD Collingwood, 2 runs down the pitch and clubbed away through midwicket to cries of 'catch it' but it's clear of everyone as deep midwicket collects;
29.2;?;Smith to PD Collingwood, no run on middle and defended to the off side;
29.1;?;Smith to PD Collingwood, no run onto the back foot and punched to a very straight and short midwicket;
28.6;?;Tait to Strauss, no run back of a length, defended back to the bowler;

12.4;?;Tait to Pietersen, no run clipped up to mid-on;

9.1;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run short, and through to the keeper;

8.3;?;Harris to Pietersen, no run nippy delivery, and Pietersen is nipped in the bud! That's gotta hurt ... and sure enough it does ... he's down and taking a breather. The physio is out, but as David Lloyd points out, what exactly can he do? Give him a rub?;
8.2;4;Harris to Pietersen, FOUR runs overpitched to compensate, and Pietersen is onto that in a flash, a sweetly struck on-drive. Two in two;
8.1;4;Harris to Pietersen, FOUR runs banged in short, and with fine leg up, Pietersen was never going to miss out on that. Even with fine leg back he'd have climbed into it! And Harris is annoyed with himself;
7.6;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run angled delivery, strikes the pad but always going over. Strauss thinks about a single but is rightly sent back;

6.4;?;Harris to Strauss, no run;
6.3;?;Harris to Strauss, no run punched into the off side;

5.6;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run;
5.5;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run full length, attacking the stumps, and defended again. Solid work;
5.4;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run banged in short, takes the glove and deflects down to the slips. England's slow men made the difference in Australia's innings, but the Aussie quicks are bowling well so far;
5.3;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run short, and Strauss sways out of the way;
5.2;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run firmly blocked out to cover;

3.4;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run good wheels from Bollinger, still no stroke;
3.3;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run strikes the pads on leg stump, and balloons into the covers;
3.2;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run outside off, KP thinks about having a dart, but thinks better of it. As well he might. Plenty time in this innings;
3.1;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run defended with a dead bat, and the ball plops down at Pietersen's feet;
2.6;?;Tait to Strauss, no run bouncer, and Strauss ducks. Good aggression;
2.5;?;Tait to Strauss, no run pushed back into the crease, and defended to midwicket;
2.5;1w;Tait to Strauss, 1 wide too much width on that one;
2.4;1;Tait to Pietersen, 1 run flicked off the toes, well timed, but Ponting at midwicket defies his ageing limbs to field with a tumble;
2.3;?;Tait to Pietersen, no run right into the blockhole again, but forewarned is forearmed for Pietersen. He was ready for that delivery, and dug it out with ease;
2.2;?;Tait to Pietersen, no run slower ball, and Pietersen punches that back to the bowler;
2.1;1;Tait to Strauss, 1 run good batting from Strauss, put bat to ball and stole an instant single to keep the strike rotating;

1.5;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run a juicy half-volley, but KP rifles that straight to cover;
1.4;3;Bollinger to Strauss, 3 runs driven firmly into the covers, Ponting takes the pace off with his fingertips, before Steven Smith hauls it back in with an insanely committed head-first dive. Lucky there wasn't a speaker in the way of that effort;
1.3;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run Strauss swings into another pull, but the ball is long gone by the time he completes his shot;
1.2;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run attempted pull, but no real contact;
1.1;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run a strangled appeal as Strauss shapes to flick down leg. Going down;
0.6;?;Tait to Pietersen, no run full length, and driven, but without any timing. What a start;
0.5;?;Tait to Pietersen, no run another yorker-length delivery, but outside off this time. Prodded away uncertainly. 96.7mph, apparently!;
0.4;W;Tait to Kieswetter, OUT now there's no answer to that! Stunning delivery, a late-swinging yorker, and Kieswetter's middle stump is out of the ground!;Craig Kieswetter b Tait 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
0.3;1;Tait to Strauss, 1 run width, and toe-ended down to third man to get Strauss off the mark;
0.2;?;Tait to Strauss, no run fizzed down once again, late swing after the ball passes the bat. No stroke;
0.1;?;Tait to Strauss, no run rapid first delivery, outside off, and no stroke offered. Tidy and threatening start;

Welcome back. Andrew Miller here for the start of England's run-chase. They need 213 and ... well, it should be a regulation victory given how well they've played of late. But you know what they say about assumptions.
Meanwhile, how's this for a premonition of traumas to come. Germany victorious as England are undermined by penalties. And the Aussies, well they crashed out long ago. Yes, I'm talking about the European Grand Prix, which is live on ESPNF1 right now ...
Ricky Ponting, who's close to suffering a rather terminal sense-of-humour failure on this trip, has just given his team a bit of a rollicking in their huddle. Here come England's openers, Andrew Strauss and Craig Kieswetter ... and it will be Shaun Tait to bowl the first over. That's a statement of intent ... here we go ...
