Data
Over 100 runs off the last ten overs and it was in contrast to the previous game at Adelaide where the Indians choked the Australians at the death overs. Dan Christian was in blazing form and his blitz has given Australia a very good score. We've seen how unpredictable India can be with the bat.
Looks like Dhoni will have to come up with something special again. Let's see how fit Tendulkar is. Join us soon.
49.6;4lb;Pathan to Hussey, 4 leg byes goes past Dhoni! Yorker on the pads, he makes room and the ball clips his pads, sneaks past the stumps and Dhoni moved to the wrong side, it evaded him and raced to third man;
49.5;2;Pathan to Hussey, 2 runs full on the pads and he clips it in the air down to deep square leg;
49.4;4;Pathan to Hussey, FOUR runs the slower ball and Christian picks it early and hoicks it over midwicket, the fielder in the deep may have been a bit too forward;
49.3;?;Pathan to Hussey, no run near-perfect yorker again, goes between his legs and he nearly loses balance at the crease;
49.2;1lb;Pathan to Christian, 1 leg bye good comeback, the yorker and he plays all around it, can't steal a leg bye;

48.3;4;Vinay to Christian, FOUR runs the helicopter shot! Comes down the track and hammers a full delivery outside off down to long-off, the follow through was something else, Dhoni would have been proud of that, but he's not smiling now;

9.5;?;Vinay to Warner, no run Raina's chance now, at cover. Leaps up high to parry a hard smash into the turf that took off at pace. India are being generous with width to Warner.;
9.4;?;Vinay to Warner, no run over-pitched just outside off stump, Warner tries to clatter it through the off side, but misses. This pitch is much flatter than the first few overs suggested.;
9.3;1;Vinay to Wade, 1 run on the pads, Wade tucks it square, and Jadeja nearly catches Warner napping with a quick pick up and throw, but he misses. Warner's in, and the 50 is up.;
9.2;?;Vinay to Wade, no run;
9.1;4;Vinay to Wade, FOUR runs Zaheer Khan goes down at third man with the grace of a Bollywood actor in an action scene, on the stunt double's off day. Width to Wade wide of off stump, and he cracks it square. Zaheer had a long way to run, and then went down like a crumbling building, but the ball slipped through.;
8.6;?;Khan to Warner, no run full again, Warner looks to get forward and is a touch late on the check drive to the off side. Super over this for Aus.;
8.5;6;Khan to Warner, SIX runs shot of the afternoon! Warner's yorked the boundary skirting at long-on with a rousing pick-up punch. Friendly length ball from Zaheer, who isn't moving the ball about anymore and Warner's thumped it rather disdainfully. Jabbed through the line, and he holds the pose too with a protracted follow through.;
8.4;4;Khan to Warner, FOUR runs Zaheer's poor start continues. Over-pitched on off stump now, and Warner's shifting into gear rampantly now. Sets himself up beside the line, gets under the ball and trumpets it through the covers with a rasping drive.;
8.3;?;Khan to Warner, no run better line and length, Warner defends into the off side.;
8.2;4;Khan to Warner, FOUR runs Warner will pinch himself to confirm that he has indeed got a four away through the off side. Zaheer gives him miles of width outside off and Warner does well to reach it. In fact it went off the toe end of the bat and flew between cover and point.;
8.1;?;Khan to Warner, no run comes in with the angle, and Warner's attempt to work it to the leg side ends up in a tangle. It hits the pad, but it was going down the leg side.;
7.6;1;Vinay to Warner, 1 run angles into the pads, Warner nudges to mid-on for a single... Another shy, another ricochet, but no overthrow this time.;
7.5;?;Vinay to Warner, no run fuller length, Warner just can't get them away. This time he mistimes the cover drive after plonking his front foot across.;
7.4;?;Vinay to Warner, no run Warner covers the line as he moves across and defends down the track.;
7.3;1;Vinay to Wade, 1 run single now, softens the grip and drops it to the off side.;
7.2;?;Vinay to Wade, no run fuller length, Wade thumps into the off side and again picks out cover.;
7.1;?;Vinay to Wade, no run length ball on off stump, defended to the off side.;
6.6;3lb;Khan to Wade, 3 leg byes another quiet turn to the leg side gets Wade a single. Aha, Vinay hits the stumps from fine leg, and the ricochet gets Australia an overthrow. It went off the pad to begin with. Did I get anything right there?;
6.5;2;Khan to Wade, 2 runs angled into the pads - Zaheer's having an indifferent start to his day. Wade works it through square leg for a single.;
6.4;?;Khan to Wade, no run good length ball just outside off, Wade covers the line and opens the face to defend to the off side.;
6.3;1;Khan to Warner, 1 run Wade responds late to Warner's call for a single after he pushed it to mid-off, but no hard done. They get the single easily.;
6.2;?;Khan to Warner, no run width again, Warner thumps it powerfully into the covers, but straight to Raina.;
6.1;?;Khan to Warner, no run Jadeja's turn to dazzle at point. India cut off another four. Horror ball from Zaheer, hopelessly wide of off stump and it would have been called. Warner tries to thrash it behind point, but Jadeja's dive intervenes.;
5.6;3;Vinay to Warner, 3 runs Warner's fore-arms to the .. well.. fore. Back of a length outside off stump, angling in to cramp a normal batsman, but Warner's far from normal. He manages to power it away through the covers with a vicious jab and picks up three more.;
5.5;1lb;Vinay to Wade, 1 leg bye Wade walks right across the stumps and looks to ship, and the ball is again outside leg stump. Another leg bye taken behind square.;
5.4;1lb;Vinay to Warner, 1 leg bye Vinay strays down the leg side now from round the stumps, and Warner can't get the glance away. Dhoni trots across to field the leg bye.;
5.3;1;Vinay to Wade, 1 run goes too straight now, Wade skips and chips it through square leg for a single.;
5.2;?;Vinay to Wade, no run Vinay cuts one back in slightly from outside off, Wade tries to force it away square but plays it to point.;
5.1;?;Vinay to Wade, no run Wade looks to wallop Vinay up and over the off side, but there's just no width to work with, and he misses it completely. Strange choice of shot.;
4.6;4;Khan to Warner, FOUR runs At long last, the first four of the day. Zaheer loses his line and strays down the leg side. Warner is inside the line and just helps it along to fine leg.;
4.5;?;Khan to Warner, no run gets him forward again, Warner meets it with a good forward press and plays to cover.;
4.4;?;Khan to Warner, no run Zak goes fuller on the stumps, and Warner defends it to the off side.;
4.3;?;Khan to Warner, no run big seam movement from a shorter length. Warner stayed back and looked to lash it square, but it beat him by a good distance.;
4.2;1;Khan to Wade, 1 run too short to trouble Wade. He goes back in the crease and jabs a short ball towards third man for one more.;
4.1;1;Khan to Warner, 1 run Warner gets another single in front of point, staying back in his crease to a length ball and steering carefully.;
3.6;1;Vinay to Warner, 1 run Warner squeezes another one past a prancing Kohli, and gets a single behind square on the off side.;
3.5;?;Vinay to Warner, no run Vinay plugs away short of a length outside off, and Warner covers the line to defend to the point area.;
3.4;2;Vinay to Warner, 2 runs Warner gets it away finally, stays back and steers off the face of the bat between point and cover for a couple.;
3.3;?;Vinay to Warner, no run electric from Kohli. This is the best Indian fielding side of all-time. Short ball outside off to Warner, who crashes it behind square and Kohli goes horizontal to his right at point to cut it off. Four runs saved.;
3.2;?;Vinay to Warner, no run gets good connection on the punchy cut this time, but finds point.;
3.1;?;Vinay to Warner, no run short and wide, but not as short or as wide as Warner thought. He wanted to blaze it through the covers, but chops it to the off side without timing.;
2.6;?;Khan to Wade, no run Wade stays cautious, reaches out to a full length ball and defends into the covers. He is a slow starter, but can take off once he gets in.;
2.5;?;Khan to Wade, no run pitched well up on the stumps, Wade defends solidly down the track.;
2.4;?;Khan to Wade, no run draws his front foot out once more, and Wade again lets the ball go through to MSD;
2.3;?;Khan to Wade, no run goes a touch fuller and gets the ball to straighten from wide of off stump. Impressive carry for Zaheer as Wade shoulders arms.;
2.2;?;Khan to Wade, no run short of a length, wide of off stump and he lets it go.;
2.1;?;Khan to Wade, no run he gets his outside edge again. Wade just seemed to be defending inside the line there, and the ball popped softly off the outer half, on the bounce to Tendulkar at first slip.;
2.1;1w;Khan to Wade, 1 wide no confusion this time. Another big wide from Zaheer, and Davis call is there for all to see.;
1.6;1;Vinay to Wade, 1 run short of a length outside off stump, Wade chops it square and picks up a single.;
1.5;?;Vinay to Wade, no run angled across on a length, not much sideways movement for Vinay. Wade leaves.;
1.4;1;Vinay to Warner, 1 run width now, Warner sets up nicely and flays it behind square, but Zaheer tidies up at third man.;
1.3;?;Vinay to Warner, no run stays on the back foot and defends again.;
1.2;?;Vinay to Warner, no run good lengths, can't be driven and can't be pulled. The line is good too, and Warner defends.;
1.1;?;Vinay to Warner, no run back of a length outside off, angled into Warner who is tucked up and defends from the crease.;
0.6;?;Khan to Wade, no run full length outside off stump, driven to cover solidly;
0.5;?;Khan to Wade, no run draws Wade marginally forward with a fuller length, and Wade defends down the track.;
0.4;?;Khan to Wade, no run better line, Wade handles it carefully.;
0.3;2;Khan to Wade, 2 runs on Wade's pads, and he tucks it quite crisply through the leg side for a couple.;
0.2;2;Khan to Wade, 2 runs dropped by Rohit Sharma at first slip. And the reason for the drop was that Rohit was positioned at second slip. This would have been a regulation take for Tendulkar to his left at first slip, but Rohit came flying across in front of him for a one-handed take. He gets his hand on it and grasses it.;
0.1;?;Khan to Wade, no run short of a length outside off stump, Wade stays back and defends to the off side.;
0.1;1w;Khan to Wade, 1 wide that wasn't too far from being a wide. Back of a length, well outside off stump and it them seams away prodigiously. Ah it was called a wide after all.;

Wade and Warner walk out wistfully onto the Woolloongabba. That's as many Ws as I can manage in a sentence. Zaheer to open the bowling, over the stumps.
This has got to be the weirdest story ever. England toured Australia in 1861-62 only because Charles Dickens refused to go, and the 7000 pounds that were ear-marked for the novelist's visit could fund the cricket team. Some twist in the tale that. Oliver Tw... (ok, I desist).
But consider just how much the game has changed since then. Imagine the Indian team touring New Zealand, capitalising on a cancelled Chetan Bhagat book tour...
"Please, please don't even use Chetan Bhagat and Charles Dickens on the same sentence." Jagannath, do note that I slyly put them in different paragraphs.
"Cant believe it. India playing with 4 pacers and Aussies with 3. Interesting." And England winning ODIs. In Asia. It's got to be 2012, Manu.
"Adelaide Test Match, the Two T20s and now the 5 ODIs. Australia have batted first 8 times in a row." They must have forgotten what it is to bat under lights, eh Max.
"Yeah, and if somebody is dismissed, the PA system can play the ABBA classic : "Does Your Mother Know That You're Out?" Ouch, Tejas.
Toss: MS Dhoni makes his first wrong call of the day. Heads he says, tails it is, and Ponting chooses to bat. He expects the pitch to favour batting by and large, but there could be swing under the lights. He wants his guys to play their natural game. Clint McKay is out with an illness, which is bad news for India. Their Test tormentor Ben Hilfenhaus is playing.
"There are not many black hairs left on my head," says Dhoni with a twinkle in his eyes. Sehwag's back continues to have spasmodic issues, but Zaheer Khan comes in for R Ashwin. Sanjay Manjrekar reckons that the shorter boundaries in Brisbane might have been the reason for the spinner getting the boot.
12.40 pm Someone with a very questionable sense of humour thought it fit to play ABBA on the PA system. A pun on the Gabba? Groan.
A warm welcome to the Gabbatoir leg of the CB Series, with all three sides well and truly in the fray. Australia need a turnaround in form, fortune and potentially a rejig of their batting order, while India are set to continue their rotation with the assurance and certainty of a planetary body.. India have won their last two outings against Australia at the Gabba, as Brydon Coverdale's preview will let you know.
Some more reading material to bring you all up to speed: Mickey Arthur thinks Australia need to deal with fatigue as their summer rolls on. One man who is experiencing the opposite of fatigue as the summer continues is Vinay Kumar. Remember his Test debut in Perth? He's managed a rather impressive turnaround since then.
A typical Gabba wicket, pronounces Ravi Shastri, and Wasim Akram nods sagely. Someone must do a survey of just how often these commentators get the pitch report right. In any case, this strip looks hard and white, which means good bounce, which could help stroke-players. Not much grass on offer. Toss is a moment or two away.
 Innings Start
Presentation:
Dhoni: The breakthroughs put pressure on us. People often think about the asking rate. The two new balls make it a bit difficult so you have to respect that early on. It gets a bit easier to hit in the middle overs. Our bowlers were affected by the heat, they were cramping so it affected their execution."
Hilfenhaus is the Man of the Match: "The new white ball swings a lot and I like it for sure. I couldn't get Sachin through the Test series so I had to get him sometime."
Ponting: I thought out score was just above par. The Indians didn't hit that many boundaries so we were fantastic. We've turned the momentum back our way. We knew the pitch would offer a bit more at night. Great for Brett the way he bowled."
The debate over India's rotation will continue before their next match on Tuesday.
That's it from us. Thanks for your company. The cricket continues. Cheers everyone!
End of match: Australia move to the top of the table, thanks in no small way to a lackluster performance by India. They now move to the top of the table. Anything above 260 was always going to intimidate India, going by the last few chases, so Australia practically won this game when they stepped out for the second innings. Lee and Hilfenhaus had the better of the bowling conditions and ensured the Indian top order didn't turn things around.

He really must buy Wade a few drinks for this catch, Zaheer makes room to a short delivery on the body, takes his eyes off the ball and top edges the pull, Wade runs all the way towards short square leg and takes the catch on the dive, very similar to the one that got Irfan.

10.3;W;Hilfenhaus to Kohli, OUT Appeal for a catch at slip, Kohli isn't sure if that carried to David Hussey at slip, outside edge travels low to Hussey's right and the catcher was certain he took it cleanly, the umpires have a chat and refer it upstairs, from the square leg angle it looked alright and the third umpire is convinced. Kohli doesn't look too pleased but he has to go;Virat Kohli c Hussey b Hilfenhaus 12 (44m 25b 0x4 0x6) SR: 48;

5.6;?;Lee to Raina, no run pacy delivery outside off and he safely leaves it alone;
5.5;W;Lee to Rohit Sharma, OUT slashed and edged! Length ball outside off, Rohit is tempted to slash it away and he does by staying rooted to the crease, thick edge to Wade and Bowden raises the crooked finger and immediately cautions the batsman to wait, just to check if it was a front-foot no-ball. It's legal and a peeved Rohit exchanges a few words to the fielders. Perhaps they said something to provoke him;Rohit Sharma c ?Wade b Lee 0 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

4.4;W;Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, OUT Doherty again! But this time he hangs on to it easily! Tendulkar arches backward to a short delivery to play one of his signature shots - the upper cut over the slips and third man - didn't get the elevation and Doherty at third man barely had to move;Sachin Tendulkar c Doherty b Hilfenhaus 3 (21m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
4.3;1;Hilfenhaus to Kohli, 1 run Dropped Doherty this time! Kohli goes for a wild slash and the top edge swirls towards third man, Doherty does well to run across to his left but he fluffed it;
4.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Kohli, no run;
4.1;2;Hilfenhaus to Kohli, 2 runs short outside off and he carves it over cover point;
3.6;?;Lee to Tendulkar, no run There's an appeal for a catch to mid-on and the umpire Davis perhaps reckoned that hit his helmet, in fact he was right, it was a brute of a delivery that kicked up and balooned off the helmet and mid-on (Doherty) ran forward and took it, Davis was not interested, all the Australians thought they had him;
3.5;?;Lee to Tendulkar, no run he tries to create a scoring opportunity by giving room but he steers it down to point;

2.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, no run Free Hit And Tendulkar fails to put it away, to the bowler's credit, it was quite difficult to hit, on the blockhole outside off;
2.5;1nb;Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, (no ball) he oversteps! Too full outside off and he can only drive it back to the bowler;
2.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, no run induces the false shot! Pitches it up and swings it away and Tendulkar slashes and misses;
2.3;1;Hilfenhaus to Kohli, 1 run a touch too wide and he opens the face of the bat and dabs it down to third man;
2.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Kohli, no run short of a length and he goes back and defends;

1.4;?;Lee to Kohli, no run stays right behind the line and defends;
1.3;W;Lee to Gambhir, OUT Lee has got rid of the in-form man! Peach of a delivery on the corridor outside the off stump, Gambhir was tentative on the defense, didn't move his feet across and he was beaten for a bit of extra pace too, thin edge taken by Wade;Gautam Gambhir c ?Wade b Lee 5 (6m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100;
1.2;1;Lee to Tendulkar, 1 run fends off another short one to the off side and takes the single easily this time;

0.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, no run swings it away outside the off stump and he leaves it alone;
0.4;1;Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, 1 run inside edge on the drive and Forrest dives at square leg but can't cut it off cleanly;
0.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run;
0.3;1w;Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, 1 wide down the leg side and Gambhir tries to run it down to fine leg and the bowler thought he got a touch to it;
0.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, no run swings away and he squeezes it out back to the bowler;
0.1;4;Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, FOUR runs that knocks four off the target straightaway, swinging in and landing on the half volley, crisply driven down the ground wide of long-of;

Welcome back. We're about five minutes away from the chase. Loud cheers as Tendulkar walks out. His shin's fine. Just watching the action from the T20 in New Zealand. India wouldn't mind batting there now, chasing this target at that stamp-sized ground in Hamilton.
Kapil: "India needs to be realistic here. Only Sachin can win this match. If he gets out early, they should just look to prevent Aus from getting the bonus point."
