Data
7pm Well, 159 isn't the worst total, but Sri Lanka have been all over Australia this afternoon. Terrific bowling from Mendis and Malinga, and they ought to fancy themselves to chase 160. Back in 10 minutes, folks.
19.6;4;Malinga to Bracken, FOUR runs a thick inside edge for four! Great bonus for Australia there;
19.5;W;Malinga to Hauritz, OUT outside edge, another one for Malinga - well caught by Sangakkara low to his right;Nathan Hauritz c ?Sangakkara b Malinga 4 (2m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33;
19.4;4;Malinga to Hauritz, FOUR runs clipped neatly off his legs for four down to fine leg;
19.3;?;Malinga to Hauritz, no run a little wide of the off stump - plays and misses;
19.2;W;Malinga to Lee, OUT what a yorker. Oh well bowled! Very, very fast and hit the base of the leg stump which is sent cartwheeling;Brett Lee b Malinga 15 (5b 2x4 1x6) SR: 300;
19.1;4;Malinga to Lee, FOUR runs Lee steps to leg in classical tailender fashion in an attempt to scorch this over midwicket, but top-edges it over the keeper for four;
18.6;1;Udana to Lee, 1 run beaten by a slower ball, slicing it short of third man;
18.5;6;Udana to Lee, SIX runs nailed it! Absolutely creamed this full toss over wide long-on. Huge, ugly power and great to watch;
18.4;4;Udana to Lee, FOUR runs bang! Terrific blow by Lee, hammering this back past the bowler for four. Heavy power;
18.3;1;Udana to Johnson, 1 run slower ball, picked by Johnson who works him to long-on;
18.2;W;Udana to Hussey, OUT tries to repeat the shot but slices it high and point swallows it with ease;David Hussey c Jayasuriya b Udana 28 (28m 22b 1x4 2x6) SR: 127.27;
18.1;6;Udana to Hussey, SIX runs that. Is. Huge. Brilliant shot, getting his front foot out of the way and clobbering it wide of long-on. Ping!;
15.6;4;Murali to Johnson, FOUR runs clipped off his pads down to third man for four. Easy;
15.5;6;Murali to Johnson, SIX runs sheesh, that is huge. A massive slog sweep - the noise of bat on ball was sweet as a nut! The timing perfect;
15.4;1;Murali to Hussey, 1 run comes confidently forward onto the front foot, meeting the pitch of the ball and flicking to leg;
15.3;3;Murali to Johnson, 3 runs a carving slap off the back foot;
15.2;6;Murali to Johnson, SIX runs big, big six. He didn't quite time his sweep-slog, skying it miles in the air, but it just about had the legs on it;
15.1;1;Murali to Hussey, 1 run stroked to mid-off;
14.6;?;Mendis to Johnson, no run comes back into the left-hander and really rushes him - that was heading onto his off stump! Just got his bat down in time;
14.5;W;Mendis to Hussey, OUT what bowling. What belief and guile from Mendis. A quicker and fuller ball to Hussey who's rapped absolutely dead in front. Too quick, too straight;Michael Hussey lbw b Mendis 1 (7m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
14.4;1;Mendis to Hussey, 1 run flicked back to the bowler;
14.3;6;Mendis to Hussey, SIX runs a monster from David Hussey! That is huge! Down the pitch and he absolutely nailed it into the sky, over the top, for six;
14.2;?;Mendis to Hussey, no run patted back to Mendis, nearly into his hands!;
14.1;?;Mendis to Hussey, no run nearly another wicket for Mendis! Outside off, he tried to pull it from wide of the off stump and got a bottom edge;
17.6;?;Malinga to Johnson, no run oh great ball! Johnson completely deceived by this slower ball and somehow doesn't lose his off stump;
17.5;?;Malinga to Johnson, no run a full bunger wide of the off stump - Johnson didn't pick that up at all. Shakes his head as if to say "what was that?";
17.4;1;Malinga to Hussey, 1 run slow bouncer, pulled to nowhere;
17.3;1;Malinga to Johnson, 1 run another attempted yorker clipped to mid-on whose throw comes in and whacks Ian Gould (umpire) on the ankle!;
17.2;2;Malinga to Johnson, 2 runs down the leg side and very full, chipped it uppishly and is fortunate that it falls safe at midwicket. Could've flown anywhere;
17.1;1;Malinga to Hussey, 1 run another slower ball on middle-and-leg;
16.6;1;Mendis to Hussey, 1 run half-tracker, pulled over midwicket but can't place it;
16.5;1;Mendis to Johnson, 1 run down the pitch, cracks it to long-off;
16.4;?;Mendis to Johnson, no run the straightest of bats meets the straightest of deliveries;
16.3;4;Mendis to Johnson, FOUR runs that was almost a medium pacer - outside off and Johnson back-cut it for four. Top, top shot;
16.2;1;Mendis to Hussey, 1 run pushed out to the off side;
16.1;2;Mendis to Hussey, 2 runs short and quick, pulled with muscular power over midwicket;
13.6;?;Murali to Hussey, no run flicked to leg to end a superbly parsimonious over;
13.5;?;Murali to Hussey, no run good, straight delivery - excellent pace, just quick enough to keep him honest;
13.4;1;Murali to Hussey, 1 run short, pulled through midwicket;
13.3;?;Murali to Hussey, no run the doosra squares him up, but he plays it well with late hands;
13.2;?;Murali to Hussey, no run works it to leg;
13.1;?;Murali to Hussey, no run rapped on the pads, huge shout - but it pitched outside the off stump. Just...and was a little high I think;
12.6;1;Udana to Hussey, 1 run slower nut stroked to long-off;
12.5;4;Udana to Hussey, FOUR runs quicker ball and laced through the covers for four;
12.4;1;Udana to Hussey, 1 run another slower ball and cripes, this was close to shattering his stumps - a thick inside edge;
12.4;1w;Udana to Hussey, 1 wide another very slow ball but it's too wide this time to the left-hander;
12.3;?;Udana to Hussey, no run turned to leg;
12.2;W;Udana to Clarke, OUT another one done by a slower delivery. Are you watching, England? Superb delivery on middle-and-leg which Clarke picked, but got a leading edge back to the bowler who took a great low catch with his left hand;Michael Clarke c & b Udana 11 (17m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 73.33;
12.1;2;Udana to Clarke, 2 runs swung over midwicket;
11.6;1;Murali to Clarke, 1 run down the leg side and turned to short fine-leg;
11.5;?;Murali to Clarke, no run quicker ball, down the pitch to defend;
11.4;1;Murali to Hussey, 1 run guides this out to the off side and they finally scamper a run;
11.3;?;Murali to Hussey, no run nudged to leg - no run there!;
11.2;?;Murali to Hussey, no run on middle-and-leg, defended with haste;
11.1;1;Murali to Clarke, 1 run full, dug out;
10.6;W;Malinga to Haddin, OUT bowled him! Comical cricket. A slower full-toss which Haddin seemed to pick, but it dipped late on him and splattered his stumps - the off stump and middle stump both flattened;Brad Haddin b Malinga 16 (18m 17b 0x4 1x6) SR: 94.11;
10.5;1;Malinga to Clarke, 1 run flicked to leg;
10.4;1;Malinga to Haddin, 1 run sweetly timed but straight to a wide mid-off;
10.3;?;Malinga to Haddin, no run faster, swinging delivery which beats the batsman's wild swing;
10.2;1;Malinga to Clarke, 1 run slower ball and he picks it, pushing it carefully to cover;
10.1;?;Malinga to Clarke, no run smashed to cover - absolutely nailed it;
10.1;1w;Malinga to Clarke, 1 wide down the leg side and wided;
9.6;?;Murali to Haddin, no run flicked to leg;
9.5;?;Murali to Haddin, no run down the pitch, padding away;
9.4;1;Murali to Clarke, 1 run onto the sweep and times it well but can't find the placement;
9.3;1;Murali to Haddin, 1 run quicker ball which rushes onto him and he flicks it to midwicket;
9.2;1;Murali to Clarke, 1 run pulled to midwicket;
9.1;1;Murali to Haddin, 1 run down the pitch flicking to deep midwicket;
8.6;?;Udana to Clarke, no run back-cut to backward point;
8.5;1;Udana to Haddin, 1 run squeezed out to the off side;
8.4;1;Udana to Clarke, 1 run very slow ball again outside off, guided down to third man who wings in a very accurate throw which knocks over the bails;
8.3;1;Udana to Haddin, 1 run fuller delivery driven out to long-off;
8.2;2;Udana to Haddin, 2 runs very, very slow! Pats it out down to third man and they get two. This pair are so fast between the wickets - watching them is a great exercise for kids in how to run;
8.1;?;Udana to Haddin, no run forced off the back foot into the covers;
7.6;?;Mendis to Clarke, no run big shout as he went for a sweep - looks a very good shout to me, but it's not out;
7.5;2;Mendis to Clarke, 2 runs flicked to fine leg for a single - no, they're coming back for two and the throw's accurate and hard. A direct hit would've had Clarke heading back to the dug-out, without a doubt;
7.4;?;Mendis to Clarke, no run defends solidly;
7.3;W;Mendis to Watson, OUT gone! Watson attempts a horrible sweep to this very full and straight delivery, and he's hit on the back pad. Poor stroke - quality bowling;Shane Watson lbw b Mendis 22 (32m 21b 2x4 1x6) SR: 104.76;
7.2;1;Mendis to Haddin, 1 run quicker ball flicked to leg;
7.1;?;Mendis to Haddin, no run fuller delivery, jabs down on it;
6.6;1;Jayasuriya to Haddin, 1 run dances down the pitch with ballerina-fast feet, flicking him to wide long-on;
6.5;6;Jayasuriya to Haddin, SIX runs shot. Shot indeed. Down onto one knee to this quicker ball and sweeps him out of the ground. This guy is some batsman;
6.4;?;Jayasuriya to Haddin, no run down the pitch, he tries to flip him over midwicket but gets a thick inside edge to the lurking man at short fine leg. No run there;
6.3;1;Jayasuriya to Watson, 1 run well wide of the off stump, no feet movement and Watson reaches for it, slapping it back past the bowler;
6.2;1;Jayasuriya to Haddin, 1 run flatter and quicker, patted to leg;
6.1;1;Jayasuriya to Watson, 1 run short of a length and nicely tucked off his hip;
5.6;W;Mendis to Ponting, OUT bowled him! Ponting stepped outside leg trying to smite him over cover but loses his leg stump. Looked to me like a leggie from Mendis;Ricky Ponting b Mendis 25 (23m 15b 5x4 0x6) SR: 166.66;
5.5;?;Mendis to Ponting, no run good pace, 57mph, and Ponting pushes it out cautiously to the off side;
5.4;?;Mendis to Ponting, no run and this one bounces, Ponting goes back and defends out to the off side;
5.3;1;Mendis to Watson, 1 run short, pulled;
5.2;?;Mendis to Watson, no run short of a length and defended out to mid-off. Short mid-off, actually;
5.1;?;Mendis to Watson, no run that's missed everything I think! The zooter hurries on, Watson didn't pick it and it flicked his pad on the way through - excellent take;
4.6;1;Malinga to Watson, 1 run a full toss at 86.7mph (75.34 knots, 38.76 metres-per-second), bashed back to the bowler;
4.5;?;Malinga to Watson, no run tries to clip this off his legs but can't time it at all;
4.4;?;Malinga to Watson, no run outside off, Watson chips to point;
4.4;2w;Malinga to Ponting, 2 wide a full bunger down the leg side;
4.3;4;Malinga to Ponting, FOUR runs mistimed over mid-on - and only just over the fielder. I thought initially he'd hit the cover off it, but he clearly hadn't;
4.2;4;Malinga to Ponting, FOUR runs fantastic stroke from Ponting once more. Came walking down the pitch, opened the face and cracked it square of the wicket - that bounced quite a bit, but he rode it quite perfectly. Top, top shot;
4.1;4;Malinga to Ponting, FOUR runs starts with a delivery much too straight. Ponting needs no second invitation, clipping it with excellent timing down to fine leg;
3.6;?;Udana to Watson, no run slower ball - 59mph - which he tried to slap through midwicket but missed;
3.5;?;Udana to Watson, no run angled across him and Watson shaped to play before withdrawing his bat at the last moment;
3.4;6;Udana to Watson, SIX runs six more! Beautiful from Watson, just picking it up off his legs and timing it magnificently. Bish, bash, bosh;
3.3;4;Udana to Watson, FOUR runs fortuitous shot. A thick outside edge flies down to third man, but good intent showed by Watson here, unsettling the young bowler;
3.2;4;Udana to Watson, FOUR runs lofted with ugly, caveman power over long-on. Really did smack that!;
3.1;1;Udana to Ponting, 1 run on middle-and-off, Ponting drives watchfully without power to the diving mid-off. Good, sprawling stop;
2.6;?;Angelo Mathews to Watson, no run Watson defends to cover, coming massively forward ala Hayden;
2.6;1w;Angelo Mathews to Watson, 1 wide down the leg side and Sangakkara roars an appeal, more in hope of it not being wided than a genuine shout;
2.5;?;Angelo Mathews to Watson, no run the wrong line and it's flicked off his pads, but there's a short fine-leg to prevent the single;
2.4;3;Angelo Mathews to Ponting, 3 runs oh, shot. But that's a poor effort at extra cover, the ball flying through his legs;
2.3;4;Angelo Mathews to Ponting, FOUR runs goes for a cut and inside-edges it past his stumps for four! It's all a bit harum-scarum here;
2.2;1;Angelo Mathews to Watson, 1 run flicked behind square and they set off for a single - this'll be tight, but Jayawardene's throw is wide!;
2.1;?;Angelo Mathews to Watson, no run Watson tries to pull but somehow can't connect. It begged to be smacked over midwicket but it just rushed onto him a little;
1.6;?;Jayasuriya to Ponting, no run drives to mid-off;
1.5;4;Jayasuriya to Ponting, FOUR runs beautiful, orthodox back-foot drive! That's classical and elegant;
1.4;1;Jayasuriya to Watson, 1 run clamps onto this, driving to mid-on;
1.3;1;Jayasuriya to Ponting, 1 run goes for a pull but can't time it, and they scamper a single;
1.2;?;Jayasuriya to Ponting, no run flicked around the corner;
1.1;1;Jayasuriya to Watson, 1 run flat, on middle and defended;
0.6;?;Angelo Mathews to Ponting, no run Ponting comes forward and defends with a squirt of the blade to point;
0.5;?;Angelo Mathews to Ponting, no run shoulders arms outside off - and this one's a right old grubber. Scoots through low to the keeper;
0.4;W;Angelo Mathews to Warner, OUT got him! Slightly shorter by Matthews and Warner cuts and slaps it straight into the hands of point!;David Warner c Dilshan b Mathews 0 (1m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
0.3;?;Angelo Mathews to Warner, no run beautiful timing but this time he picks out cover;
0.2;?;Angelo Mathews to Warner, no run Warner steps forward, driving to point;
0.1;1;Angelo Mathews to Watson, 1 run a thick inside edge to a clumpy, leaden-footed defensive by Watson. Ball could've gone anywhere;

Watson to face
Dave Warner to face the first ball I think. It's quite breezy out there - could help Sri Lanka's swingers, in a manner of speaking. Angelo Mathews to open the bowling.
Anthem watch 2 The Husseys are in good voice, both smiling - points for them. Nothing from Hauritz, even less from Watson. This is a tight one - but Ponting's pulled it out of the bag with a superb rendition. I think Australia sneak home in that little contest.
Anthem watch Sri Lanka are mostly mumbling. The crowd are in great voice - oh but wait a moment, Jayasuriya is singing his heart out. Terrific effort from the big man. Sangakkara's getting noisier, but ... well, I think Australia can win this one.
Ah, the summer has definitely begun. The first of hundreds of pommie-bashing emails. "Hope you guys are enjoying the rain," writes TNS, "and perhaps even getting out in it to use some soap!" Hilarious.
10 minutes to go. Weather cloudy but fine. This is massive.
Teams:
Australia 1 Shane Watson, 2 David Warner, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Brad Haddin (wk), 6 David Hussey, 7 Mike Hussey, 8 Mitchell Johnson, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Nathan Hauritz, 11 Nathan Bracken

Toss news. Ponting tosses, Sangakarra correctly calls heads and Sri Lanka will bowl. Sri Lanka have someone making their debut - I'm afraid I couldn't quite catch his name, and it was spoken at ferocious speed, but we'll have both teams for you in just a couple of seconds.
5.10pm We're hearing rumours that Sri Lanka were either unable to get into the ground, or merely late. We're not sure why, but we have our best men at the ground sniffing for news, and you'll be the first to hear
Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our coverage of this fascinating clash between Australia and Sri Lanka. I'm Will Luke, and before we have news of the toss, you can head over to our live discussion between Andrew Miller and Dileep Premachandran where they're chatting about Bangladesh's defeat among other pertinent things. Need I remind you, Australia have to win today - not only that, but they need to win well. Or win big, as the hip-and-groovy people might say. It's fairly massive to say the least and, as an Englishman, I'll be doing my absolute utmost to remain complete impartial. Well, I'll try.
 Innings Start
Great win by Sri Lanka - top knock from Sangakkara, and Australia will now spend the next few weeks preparing for the Ashes in the delightful hamlet of Leicester. "Is there a plate competition for the smaller teams to get experience?" ponders Travis Basevi, formerly an Australian. "Scotland, Bangladesh, Australia and maybe the Dutch?" It's a good call. Well, what a day we've had - Ireland beating Bangladesh, and now Australia are out of the competition. We'll be back tomorrow with live coverage of all the matches, so do join us then. From me, Will Luke, it's goodnight - and don't forget to read the bulletin. It'll be epic. Toodle pip for now.
19.1;1w;Johnson to Mubarak, 1 wide and Australia are out of the ICC World Twenty20 with a wide down the leg side;
18.6;1;Lee to Mubarak, 1 run pulled for two - is it? No! Just a single, but Australia can't win. They're out of the tournament;
18.5;4;Lee to Mubarak, FOUR runs carves this just over mid-off who parries it for four!;
18.4;?;Lee to Mubarak, no run plays and misses outside off;
18.4;1w;Lee to Mubarak, 1 wide wide - and rightly wided. Lee knows they're going to try and whack him over the leg-side, but he can't bowl that wide and get away with it;
18.3;6;Lee to Mubarak, SIX runs he's nailed it! It's gone! Huge shout sails over long-on;
18.2;?;Lee to Mubarak, no run very wide of the off stump. But not wided! How? Odd decision;
18.1;1;Lee to Sangakkara, 1 run wide of the off stump, Sangakkara reaches out and squeezes a run to cover;
17.6;1;Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 run very full and Sangakkara steals the strike with a drilled bosh to long-on, again;
17.5;4;Bracken to Sangakkara, FOUR runs paddle swept for four - brilliant! He made it into a full toss, just dabbing it past short third man. What guts;
17.4;1;Bracken to Mubarak, 1 run flung over midwicket but not timed;
17.3;1;Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 run drilled to long-on;
17.3;1w;Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 wide charges down the pitch to a slower ball, tries to paddle this wide outside off. Poor bowlers. They really can't win. He saw him coming and tossed it wider, and is penalised for it!;
17.2;1;Bracken to Mubarak, 1 run yorker, dug out to leg;
17.1;1;Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 run full toss banged to mid-on;
16.6;6;Lee to Mubarak, SIX runs where's this gone? Mubarak's pummelled him for six over a leaping Johnson at long-off! Tremendous stroke;
16.5;2;Lee to Mubarak, 2 runs driven hard down the ground and long-on jogs round to save four;
16.5;1w;Lee to Mubarak, 1 wide a bouncer, Mubarak leaves it alone expecting it to be wided on height - and it is;
16.4;?;Lee to Mubarak, no run well timed but straight to cover;
16.3;?;Lee to Mubarak, no run tries to uppercut but pulls out at the last moment;
16.2;?;Lee to Mubarak, no run a very fast and full delivery just outside leg;
16.1;W;Lee to Silva, OUT got him! A slower-ball bouncer which he pulls meekly, and Ponting jogs in to take an easy catch;Chamara Silva c Ponting b Lee 11 (12m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100;
15.6;1;Bracken to Silva, 1 run pushed out to the off side;
15.5;?;Bracken to Silva, no run goes for a slog sweep and Haddin appeals - as does Watson. They're convinced he's got a thin edge on that but Bowden's arm remains planted by his side. Australia are convinced - I have to say I didn't hear anything and Bowden looks perplexed by their insistence;
15.4;1;Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 run fuller delivery on his legs and they scamper a single. Good attempt by Haddin to flick a return onto the stumps;
15.3;1;Bracken to Silva, 1 run patted out to deep extra cover. Just a stroke there, no power in the stroke;
15.2;1;Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 run clunked to the leg side, out to long-on on the boundary;
15.1;1;Bracken to Silva, 1 run back-cut to a short third man;
14.6;1;Hauritz to Silva, 1 run comes down the pitch and clips to mid-on;
14.5;1;Hauritz to Sangakkara, 1 run little tap to leg;
14.4;6;Hauritz to Sangakkara, SIX runs another one! A lofted beauty from Sangakkara over the top. Elegance and class;
14.3;6;Hauritz to Sangakkara, SIX runs great blow from the captain - a slog-sweep over square leg and it goes three rows back;
14.2;?;Hauritz to Sangakkara, no run clamps forward into a defensive. Good, tight line from Hauritz;
14.1;2;Hauritz to Sangakkara, 2 runs cracked wide of long-off;
13.6;?;Clarke to Silva, no run attempts a slog sweep but misses. And only just!;
13.5;?;Clarke to Silva, no run down the pitch, patting out to cover;
13.4;2;Clarke to Silva, 2 runs paddled around the corner and they'll get two;
13.3;4;Clarke to Silva, FOUR runs makes this into a full toss, sweeping it powerfully and placing it perfectly. That ought to help;
13.2;1;Clarke to Sangakkara, 1 run turned off his hip for a single;
13.1;1;Clarke to Silva, 1 run swept hard but there's a sweeper out there;
12.6;?;Hauritz to Sangakkara, no run a huge shout as he goes for a sweep but is rapped on the pads, but it's perhaps spinning past the off stump. Perilously close;
12.5;W;Hauritz to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT got him this time! Down the pitch and slices it to point;Mahela Jayawardene c Bracken b Hauritz 9 (11m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 75;
12.4;2;Hauritz to Mahela Jayawardene, 2 runs skips down the pitch and clatters it wide of long-off. Mid-off gives chase and destroys the boundary rope;
12.3;?;Hauritz to Mahela Jayawardene, no run goes for a sweep and nearly top edges;
12.2;1;Hauritz to Sangakkara, 1 run fired in full;
12.1;?;Hauritz to Sangakkara, no run defended;
11.6;?;Clarke to Mahela Jayawardene, no run beaten by a beauty! That turned and ripped and bounced and took either the edge of the bat or the pad. Sorry. It's all too fast and we're now on a new over;
11.5;1;Clarke to Sangakkara, 1 run turned to leg;
11.4;?;Clarke to Sangakkara, no run flicked to leg;
11.3;2;Clarke to Sangakkara, 2 runs launched with greater power and intent but there's a sweeper on the midwicket boundary;
11.2;2;Clarke to Sangakkara, 2 runs dances down the pitch to make it into a full toss and plonks it into the deep on the leg-side for an easy two;
11.1;1;Clarke to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run too straight. Waits for it on the back foot and nurdles another easy single;
10.6;?;Hauritz to Sangakkara, no run blocked to leg;
10.5;1;Hauritz to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run too full - easily clipped off his toes. Good running;
10.4;?;Hauritz to Mahela Jayawardene, no run comes forward and turns to short fine leg;
10.3;1lb;Hauritz to Sangakkara, 1 leg bye tickled off his toes;
10.2;?;Hauritz to Sangakkara, no run prods forward;
10.1;1;Hauritz to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run floated outside off, prods to cover;

9.5;2;Clarke to Mahela Jayawardene, 2 runs goes inside out and cover-drives elegantly;
9.4;1;Clarke to Sangakkara, 1 run timed to long-on;
9.3;1;Clarke to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run flighted on leg stump - touch of drift in the air, and it's worked to the leg side;
9.2;?;Clarke to Mahela Jayawardene, no run pushed out to the off side;
9.1;W;Clarke to Dilshan, OUT bowled him with a beauty! Beat him in the flight as Dilshan came skipping down the pitch;Tillakaratne Dilshan b Clarke 53 (46m 32b 10x4 0x6) SR: 165.62;
8.6;1;Hauritz to Dilshan, 1 run can't quite time this flog over midwicket;
8.5;2;Hauritz to Dilshan, 2 runs meets the pitch of the ball outside off and whips it to square leg;
8.4;?;Hauritz to Dilshan, no run tossed up, defended;
8.3;1;Hauritz to Sangakkara, 1 run turned to leg;
8.2;?;Hauritz to Sangakkara, no run yikes, that turned some! Excellent ball beats the left-hander's pokey prod;
8.1;2;Hauritz to Sangakkara, 2 runs neatly clipped through midwicket;
7.6;?;Watson to Dilshan, no run punched to point;
7.5;?;Watson to Dilshan, no run turned to leg;
7.4;4;Watson to Dilshan, FOUR runs that is disgraceful and brilliant! An amazing shot to bring up his fifty. He ducked beneath a good-length ball, flicking his bat up vertically to lift it over the keeper. You've seen batsman to these paddly uppercuts, but that was simply outrageous!;
7.3;2;Watson to Dilshan, 2 runs a full toss, bashed out to extra cover;
7.2;1;Watson to Sangakkara, 1 run opens the face and gets a single to point;
7.1;1;Watson to Dilshan, 1 run cover-driven out to, well...cover. Obviously;
6.6;1;Johnson to Dilshan, 1 run not middled, but nevertheless pulled through square leg;
6.5;?;Johnson to Dilshan, no run ooh, beaten by a nice one outside the off stump;
6.5;1w;Johnson to Dilshan, 1 wide well wide of the off stump;
6.4;1;Johnson to Sangakkara, 1 run flicked down to fine leg;
6.3;?;Johnson to Sangakkara, no run patted out square of the wicket;
6.2;1;Johnson to Dilshan, 1 run pats it down to third man;
6.1;1;Johnson to Sangakkara, 1 run starts with a straight one which is whipped to square leg;
5.6;?;Bracken to Dilshan, no run gives himself room and chops to third man;
5.5;1;Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 run clipped to leg;
5.4;2;Bracken to Sangakkara, 2 runs a mistimed cover-driven slap over the top;
5.3;1;Bracken to Dilshan, 1 run cracked square of the wicket;
5.2;4;Bracken to Dilshan, FOUR runs lifted over mid-on for another four;
5.1;1;Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 run prods to mid-on;
4.6;4;Watson to Dilshan, FOUR runs another one! Flayed without a care in the world past backward point. Twenty20 batting at its most enjoyable;
4.5;?;Watson to Dilshan, no run angled to short third man. Better and fuller delivery;
4.4;4;Watson to Dilshan, FOUR runs uppercut over short third man. This is dreadful from Watson I'm afraid and Dilshan is all over him;
4.3;4;Watson to Dilshan, FOUR runs deft and quite brilliant sweep, on the full. How do you play that? Well, with vast amounts of cheek and confidence I suppose. Audacious and well appreciated by a cacophonous crowd;
4.2;?;Watson to Dilshan, no run outside off and hammered but backward point scores a fine save to his right;
4.1;4;Watson to Dilshan, FOUR runs oh dear. Tripe from Watson. A dibbly-dobbler and a half-tracker, too, smashed over midwicket for four. Treated with total disdain;
3.6;?;Bracken to Sangakkara, no run defended on the front foot;
3.5;4;Bracken to Sangakkara, FOUR runs crunched over mid-off for four. Down on one knee and hit cross-battedly with perfect placement and power;
3.4;1;Bracken to Dilshan, 1 run dabbed out to the off side;
3.3;?;Bracken to Dilshan, no run patted out to the off side;
3.2;?;Bracken to Dilshan, no run Dilshan lines up another fearsomely driven four but the (very) short extra-cover fields it, and his hands must now surely be bleeding;
3.1;4;Bracken to Dilshan, FOUR runs bang! Outside off and smashed on the up over cover. Bracken cries "arghhhh" in frustration;
2.6;4;Lee to Sangakkara, FOUR runs oh shot, shot, shot. Steps outside leg, plants his foot and drives with audacity through extra cover;
2.6;5nb;Lee to Sangakkara, (no ball) FOUR runs edged wide of the slip for four - and it's a no-ball too! That's ruined a good over;
2.5;?;Lee to Sangakkara, no run a slower ball on middle stump this time. Very well bowled;
2.4;?;Lee to Sangakkara, no run just outside off, defends on the back foot;
2.3;?;Lee to Sangakkara, no run that's quick and short, this time, attacking the body;
2.2;?;Lee to Sangakkara, no run very good line on off stump;
2.1;W;Lee to Jayasuriya, OUT what a catch from Warner at deep square leg! Jayasuriya pulled this hard and flat, and Warner jumped up high to take it behind him, not two feet from the boundary edge. Oh yes!;Sanath Jayasuriya c Warner b Lee 2 (12m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57;
1.6;?;Johnson to Dilshan, no run fast and swinging into his off stump, carved out to point;
1.5;4;Johnson to Dilshan, FOUR runs ah, beautiful from Dilshan - an orthodox cover-drive for four. Poise and style - no Twenty20 smasherama from him;
1.4;4;Johnson to Dilshan, FOUR runs pulled over midwicket - not quite timed but he's got enough of it!;
1.3;2;Johnson to Dilshan, 2 runs cracked out through backward point;
1.2;1;Johnson to Jayasuriya, 1 run swivels onto a pull to fine leg;
1.1;?;Johnson to Jayasuriya, no run crunching back-foot cut but backward point is alert;
0.6;1;Lee to Jayasuriya, 1 run a quick run to cover;
0.5;?;Lee to Jayasuriya, no run a beauty - oh what a ball! Try to play that! It nips back and cuts him in half;
0.5;1w;Lee to Jayasuriya, 1 wide down the leg side and, whoopsy daisy - a wide;
0.4;?;Lee to Jayasuriya, no run full and fast, drilled to mid-off;
0.3;?;Lee to Jayasuriya, no run pulls and misses. I wish we had stats on how many times batsmen miss out on free-hits;
0.3;2nb;Lee to Dilshan, (no ball) 1 run short, pulls it down to fine leg but it's a front-foot no ball;
0.2;4;Lee to Dilshan, FOUR runs thumping back-foot square-cut for four! Wonderful timing;
