Hello and welcome to the first of three Chappell-Hadlee Trophy matches. The series kicks off in Adelaide before moving to Sydney and Hobart.
I'm Jamie Alter, your commentator, but enough about me, let's get this game started.
Daniel Vettori has won the toss and he's decided New Zealand will have a bat. They have left out Jeetan Patel, Gareth Hopkins and Michael Mason. Chris Martin gets a spot in the XI, that means. For Australia, Shaun Tait is in for Mitchell Johnson, and Brad Hogg and James Hopes find places too.
Plenty of activity out there, bowlers bowling to one stump, batsmen having a hit into the nets, tv crews crowding round the two captains in the middle.
Australia clobbered New Zealand in the Twenty20 the other evening, and has stated their intention of revenging their "little cousins" for last year's thumping loss. This time, they've got a few senior players involved.
Jenny Thompson in Adelaide tells me that there may possibly be showers later in the day. Fingers crossed for now.
Andrew Symonds is warming up so it looks like he's good to play, says Jenny. He had an ankle complaint picked up in the Twenty20 but it wasn't as serious as when he first did in the Hobart Test against Sri Lanka.
"I haven't seen Brett Lee so far but don't rule him out just yet," says Jenny.
Tait is set to play his first one-dayer since the World Cup and his first international on his home pitch. This is also the first international since the pitch was laid. Tait was sharp in the nets yesterday and said he was at his fastest in the Twenty20. He also cleaned up Queensland with ten match wickets in his last first-class match. Ponting is backing him for the Tests.
Jenny messages me: "Tait's looking sharp, again. Les the groundsman's done an excellent job, the pitch looks a treat and this surface has been offering fair carry on occasion this season - although not as much as the WACA in the Twenty20 on Tuesday night; that was lightning and a half. All the same, it's a flat deck - the stumps cam crew had a hard time digging into the pitch I hear - so the pace bowlers should."
Plenty of talk in the build-up, of course, about how New Zealand have been struggling to deal with the fast men.
Jenny again: "I was watching some old Australia/New Zealand one-dayers the other day to get in the mood for this series (must get out more), including the one with that underarm delivery, and what struck me was that none of the men's torsoes were covered up. That wouldn't happen these days down here with all the sun warnings: the crowd here today are, as is now the norm, slip-slap-slopped. Or, even better, they're sitting in the shade of the Chappell Stand which is at deep midwicket/deep cover opposite the members' stand.
It's a good job everyone's covered up because it's scorchio out there (bar the strands of cloud). Being a pink-skinned Pom doesn't help, of course, but at least we have dry heat out here in South Australia. There are showers forecast for later on, mind, so that could be a factor in the toss which is coming up shortly."

Umpires are out, so are the Aussies, and here come Lou Vincent and Brendon McCullum. Game on. Brett Lee has the ball. Vincent will face. Two slips for him.
 Innings Start
Australia take game one by a very comfortable seven wickets.
Just to recap, in case you came in late, New Zealand chose to bat, were given a great start by Brendan McCullum, who fell four short of a maiden ODI hundred. Barring Ross Taylor's brisk half-century there was little to speak of and Australia kept New Zealand to 254 for 7. In pursuit, Adam Gilchrist blazed a 26-ball fifty to thoroughly stamp the hosts' reign over this match, and the win was polished off by yet another fluent Ricky Ponting.
Thats all we have for you, folks. Thanks for tuning into Cricinfo again. This is Jamie Alter, your commentator, signing off.
Do join us on Sunday, December 16 for the second match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Bye for now!
