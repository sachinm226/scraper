Data
4.45pm: An odd innings, held together by Mitchell Marsh's 73 with Marcus Stoinis (43) and Glenn Maxwell (77) both putting some pressure on England's bowlers. Australia were in all sorts at 123 for 5, with Mark Wood and Adil Rashid taking two early wickets each, but managed to recover well thanks to a 126-run stand between Maxwell and Marsh. England did pretty well after Archer got Maxwell, banging the ball in halfway down at the death and taking pace off, but 295 would be a record run chase on this ground. Sreshth Shah will be here in 30 minutes or so to talk you through England's efforts with the bat.
Manvendra Singh: "With Smith out and Finch and Warner scoring a combined 22, this is a pretty decent effort"
Ujjwal Gulyani: "There has been lot of talk about Australia's middle order lately, but they have decent job today"
CharlieJ: "Amazing RR consistency from England's bowlers, must be amongst the lowest standard deviation ever in ODIs" -- Ha, good spot... only five runs between the cheapest and most expensive bowlers.
49.6;6;Woakes to Starc, SIX runs length ball, pace off again, but Starc picks it this time and nails it over midwicket for a towering six! Free swing of the arms, and it lands on the hover-cover 10 yards over the boundary. That's only the third boundary Australia have managed since Maxwell was out in the 44th over;
49.5;W;Woakes to Zampa, OUT short ball, back of a length, and Zampa top-edges the pull straight up into the air... Woakes pouches it! Australia lose their ninth, and Woakes has a wicket to show for his efforts;Adam Zampa c & b Woakes 5 (15m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;

46.6;W;Wood to Marsh, OUT struck on the pad, and the finger goes up! Marsh reviews immediately. Looked pretty good to the naked eye, and Ultra-Edge says there's no bat involved. Hit in-line, and hitting middle-and-leg three-quarters of the way up! Marsh has to depart after a gritty 73. He was looking to get off strike with a push into the leg side towards midwicket, but Wood did him for pace.;Mitchell Marsh lbw b Wood 73 (135m 100b 6x4 0x6) SR: 73;
46.5;2;Wood to Marsh, 2 runs short outside off, clothed towards long-on as he attempts a pull, but he times it so badly that it takes a while for the man on the rope to come in, and they get back for a second;

Ooft, yeah, almost slipped out as he went Australian-style with the hands up. This looked like a knuckleball - plenty of room for Cummins to free his arms, but he was through the shot far too early;Pat Cummins c Morgan b Archer 9 (10m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 128.57;
44.6;1;Wood to Cummins, 1 run slightly back of a length at 87mph/141kph, and Cummins heaves out to deep square to keep the strike;

43.2;6;Archer to Maxwell, SIX runs low full toss, and Maxwell flicks it over deep backward square for six more! Not a great ball, and Maxwell just clipped it over the rope with a little whip, the wind doing most of the hard work for him;
43.1;6;Archer to Maxwell, SIX runs in the slot on the stumps, Maxwell frees his arms looking to go leg side and sends it sailing high and mighty over the rope! Lots of elevation, but enough distance on it to fly over the midwicket boundary;

42.2;1;Woakes to Maxwell, 1 run length on fifth stump, swatted out to deep midwicket with a short-arm pull;
42.1;2;Woakes to Maxwell, 2 runs Maxwell shimmies outside leg, but Woakes follows him with a length ball. He gets enough bat on this to send it down to fine leg, perhaps with a hint of inside edge, and Maxwell is quick enough to race back for two;

37.3;4b;Rashid to Maxwell, 4 byes big swing from Maxwell, big turn from Rashid, and top-edged between Buttler and Root! Given as byes, but I'm convinced he hit it EDIT: Yep, confirmed by the replay, big edge there;
37.2;2;Rashid to Maxwell, 2 runs tossed up very wide of the off stump, and Maxwell slashes out to Billings, lurking on the cover boundary;

35.3;1;Wood to Marsh, 1 run banged in on a length, steered behind square on the off side. "Noooo... yep," cries Marsh as it just about evades the dive of backward point. He thinks about two, then barks: "Not now!";

33.4;4;Wood to Marsh, FOUR runs full and wide, and he drives with the bat's open face. Races across the ground as third man can't cut it off. Using the bowler's pace so well there;
33.3;1;Wood to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length, outside off. Rising delivery, and smartly punched after riding the bounce. Protection at extra cover though;
33.2;1;Wood to Marsh, 1 run back of a length, on off, and uncomfortably hit towards the leg side for a scampered run;
33.1;?;Wood to Marsh, no run beaten by the pace! Back of a length, and he swivels to pull, but the ball goes through him before he could swing the bat across his face;

26.4;?;Archer to Marsh, no run jaffa from Jof. Good length, on off, and moving slightly away as Marsh looks to defend. Ball whizzes past his outside edge;
26.3;?;Archer to Marsh, no run back of a length, short on off, and he ducks under it. Bat is upwards though, which isn't good hygiene. Could've hit that and popped up in the air;

24.5;1;Archer to Marsh, 1 run slower ball that does not come out right. Ends up as a dipping full toss, and driven to cover. Decent ball to be fair because Marsh was quite surprised;

24.3;?;Archer to Marsh, no run back of a length, on off, and punched right back to the bowler;
24.2;5;Archer to Maxwell, 5 runs full, on off, and the attempted straight drive is mistimed to mid on instead. The fielder at mid on has a shy at the stumps, but its an awry throw. Buttler's nowhere near, the fielder backing up has no chance either, and that's run away for some more free runs. Moeen Ali the guilty fielder. Reckon those runs should be added to his bowling tally;

19.2;W;Rashid to Labuschagne, OUT full just outside off and the googly comes into him. Big stride forward to defend, but hits his front leg, and the lbw appeal is given out! Marnus reviews right away No bat involved, and that's pitched just outside off, and hit off stump. Labuschagne needs to go. Rashid gets the wicket via the googly. Australia in all sorts of trouble;Marnus Labuschagne lbw b Rashid 21 (46m 30b 1x4 0x6) SR: 70;

18.2;?;Ali to Labuschagne, no run good length ball, and tucked to midwicket;
18.1;2;Ali to Labuschagne, 2 runs what happened there? Overpitched, and the ball goes under the drive, and turns enough to go between the keeper's legs. Umpire thinks it came off the bat but I'd disagree;
17.6;?;Rashid to Marsh, no run good length, on off. Turning away and punched off the back foot to mid off;
17.5;?;Rashid to Marsh, no run good length, outside off, and he tries to cut but misses;

16.6;4;Ali to Marsh, FOUR runs full on off, and this time he sweeps squarer than before, forcing Billings to give the ball a futile chase. A good end to the over, and Moeen's economy remains over 7;
16.5;?;Ali to Marsh, no run full, just outside off. Big stride forward to defend back to the bowler;
16.4;2;Ali to Marsh, 2 runs a big sweep, from outside off, and finds deep midwicket, where Billings cuts it off. Might have been a premeditated shot if you ask me;
16.3;?;Ali to Marsh, no run good length, on off. Skids back and fends to mid on on this occasion;
16.2;1;Ali to Labuschagne, 1 run good length, outside off, and enough time for him to go deep in his crease before punching to long off;

15.3;1;Wood to Marsh, 1 run back of a length to Marsh, angling into his body, and guided to fine leg;
15.2;W;Wood to Stoinis, OUT edged and taken! Bowls full, tempting Stoinis to drive, but the ball takes the outside edge and Buttler needs to dive to his right to take the catch. That was quick! A good innings from Stoinis in a position he usually doesn't bat in, but with the start he got, he will feel disappointed not capitalizing;Marcus Stoinis c ?Buttler b Wood 43 (56m 34b 6x4 0x6) SR: 126.47;

11.4;?;Wood to Stoinis, no run beauty, slightly full of a length as Stoinis comes forward to defend, and finds himself pushing at thin air as this flies past his edge;
11.3;4;Wood to Stoinis, FOUR runs length outside off, genuine edge as he looks to punch through cover-point, beating third man to his left;
11.2;4;Wood to Stoinis, FOUR runs hard length again, but too much width this time and Stoinis gets it away through the ring. Times the square drive nicely, threading it between cover and backward point;

Stewart Capell: "Can someone explain why Sam Billings is getting a game ahead of Hain, Livingstone, Clarke, Duckett, the list goes on." -- Impressed in England's last series, which was a rare chance for him to get a decent run.
 Innings Start
9.22pm: That's a wrap from us for today. Thanks for joining me, Sreshth, Chandan and Ranjith throughout, and see you again on Sunday for the second ODI. Alan Gardner's report will appear here shortly, and keep an eye on the site for George Dobell's musings from the ground. Cheers!
Josh Hazlewood gets player of the match ahead of Glenn Maxwell: "The batting did well to get what we got. We started really well, there were a few partnerships along the way but we stuck at it. I was happy to get eight [overs] out at the start. We made the most of it. With Roy, Bairstow, they really leave nothing in the sheds. We were lucky to get a couple early. There are a few things to work on but everything's going really well. Sometimes we rest at the end of the Test series, so it's good to play when we're fresh. Hopefully I'll play a few in the months to come. [Recovery?] That's probably the challenge, coming off not much cricket, a few T20s and a few practice games. We'll rest up tomorrow and come out again the day after."
Aaron Finch: "It was nice to win and start off the series really well. There were a couple of little cracks that Jofra and Chris Woakes exploited. It was a new-ball wicket - it was toughest to bat then. [Marsh/Maxwell] It was a great partnership. They paced it really well. They played two really smart, mature innings and I'm really happy for them two to get some runs. On that wicket, I thought we were a big chance if we bowled well early. I thought that was a really good frontline attack for that wicket, but we know how destructive England can be when they get it right."
Eoin Morgan: "The game probably slipped away from us in the first 10-12 overs with the bat. We did a reasonable job with the ball. We thought we could chase it down if we established a few partnerships. I thought they played well. You can always be greedy and want more, but an area of our game we're trying to improve is to take wickets early and we did that. [Billings] Sam's opportunities over the last four years have been limited and sporadic. To come in, show hunger and desire in his training, contribute when Joe Denly was injured in the Ireland series and get his maiden one-day hundred here is outstanding. When Ben Stokes is missing it leaves a big hole."
Lidwin: "Dhoni would have been proud of billings to take it so deep." -- Too deep, if anything!
Muhammad Salman: "With all due respect to Billings, he does not suit the England playing style. Either he plays in the top 4 or does not because he cant hit sixes and that is what England style of play demands." -- I'm sure he just hit two of them and 14 fours in a superb rearguard maiden ton after coming in at 57 for 4 and taking England close to a remarkable win? Maybe I dreamed it...
Plenty of you rightly pointed out how valuable Starc's cameo - 19 off 12 balls - ended up being for Australia. If Woakes, Rashid or Archer had managed that, it could have been very different.
9.10pm: Thanks for your company all evening but do wait for word from the two captains and also who the Player of the Match is. There are four contenders from Australia side and atleast one from, England. Here's Matt Roller to wrap the proceedings.

In the air for a while as it settles at around cow corner, and Hazlewood - at long on - dives diagonally to his right to take the catch while diving. Is that the game?;Jonny Bairstow c Hazlewood b Zampa 84 (162m 107b 4x4 4x6) SR: 78.5;
35.1;1;Zampa to Billings, 1 run overpitched on off, and struck to long off;

30.4;4;Cummins to Billings, FOUR runs slightly back of a length, and Billings pulls awkwardly, bottom-edging in front of square.

29.1;2;Stoinis to Bairstow, 2 runs Bairstow clears the front leg and heaves this high and mighty into the leg side... but there's more elevation than distance, and Labuschagne settles under it. He drops it - not that it would have counted - and England sneak back for two;
29.1;1nb;Stoinis to Bairstow, (no ball) very short bouncer to start, which loops harmlessly over Bairstow's head and is called wide. And the third umpire reckons he overstepped too, so there's a free hit coming up;

27.1;1w;Maxwell to Bairstow, 1 wide loosener, down the leg side on a length;
26.6;6;Cummins to Billings, SIX runs top-edges another pull, but it flies away over the rope for six this time! Short ball, Billings was too late on it this time and it looped up over the rope, over the boundary, and into the car park on the bounce;
26.5;4;Cummins to Billings, FOUR runs short ball, gloved agonisingly out of Carey's reach and away for four! Good battle this, Billings was through the pull too early, and it looped up off the hand over the keeper's head and beat fine leg;
26.4;?;Cummins to Billings, no run banged in on a length, Billings defends from the crease;
26.3;?;Cummins to Billings, no run beauty from Cummins! Great comeback, hint of seam movement and good bounce from wide on the crease to take it past the outside edge;

26.1;1;Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run length on fifth stump, jammed behind square on the off side for a scampered single;
25.6;?;Marsh to Billings, no run slightly fuller length, and Bairstow works towards short midwicket;
25.5;?;Marsh to Billings, no run loud appeal... not really sure what for? Australia won't review. Nipped in a fraction from a length and struck Billings above the knee from a long way down the pitch as he looked to work to leg. No sign of an inside edge, so it must have been an lbw shout, and Hawk-Eye confirms it struck outside the line;
25.4;?;Marsh to Billings, no run length ball on fourth stump, Billings shapes to pull but only manages to bottom edge into his front knee. Didn't quite get up off the pitch;

22.4;?;Zampa to Billings, no run struck on the pad while sweeping, Zampa pleads with Millns who says no yet again! And Finch won't review this time.

22.3;2;Zampa to Billings, 2 runs gets down early to sweep hard out to Cummins at deep backward square;

16.1;W;Zampa to Buttler, OUT Marnus takes a difficult catch at long off! Tossed up, tempting Buttler to go for the big one, and he shovels this in the air.

14.5;W;Zampa to Morgan, OUT good length, on middle, and the pull goes straight to midwicket! Morgan tried to pull along the ground, but he just couldn't keep it down. The wristspinner strikes!

12.5;?;Cummins to Morgan, no run back of a length, on leg stump, and once again he gets under the line of the ball. The umpire sticks out two fingers.. not the peace sign from him, he's letting Cummins know that's two bouncers;

4.1;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run full on off, and defended off the front foot. Straight back to Starc, but along the ground, unlike the Roy dismissal;
3.6;?;Hazlewood to Root, no run good length, just outside off, a bit of shape away. Root looks to defend off the back foot but the ball goes through to the keeper;
3.5;W;Hazlewood to Roy, OUT what a stunner! A one-handed grab... on his followthrough, that's epic from Hazlewood! Not full enough for the drive, yet he drives, but the ball comes off the actual middle of the bat - which isn't really the sweet spot - and Hazlewood maintains his balance to stick his right hand out and the ball stays in his palm. Big wicket t;Jason Roy c & b Hazlewood 3 (19m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
3.4;?;Hazlewood to Roy, no run back of a length, bit of extra bounce and Roy has to defend from near his chest;
3.3;?;Hazlewood to Roy, no run good length on middle, and Roy comes down the wicket to try and muscle it over Bairstow's head, but the ball goes through bat and body and into Carey's gloves;
3.2;?;Hazlewood to Roy, no run back of a length, outside off, and he opens the bat's face to punch a bit squarer. Finds cover point though;
3.1;?;Hazlewood to Roy, no run good length, outside off, kinda close to his body for the cut, but goes for it anyway. Misses, and shall be glad that didn't take a tickle to the keeper;
2.6;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run pushes it slightly further up, on off, and pushed off the front foot to mid off, but to the fielder;
2.5;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run back of a length on middle, and getting big on YJB as he tries to go for the pull. Ball goes over his blade though.;
2.4;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run good length, on middle, and he closes the bat's face to turn it leg side;
2.3;3;Starc to Roy, 3 runs back of a length, on middle, and he mistimes the grounded pull. Work for Cummins to the square-leg boundary, and he manages to save one;
2.2;1;Starc to Bairstow, 1 run good length on off, and punched to Warner at cover, who gets a direct hit at the keeper's end but they're safe. No runs off the overthrows either;
2.1;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run full ball, but pushes it wider, forcing Bairstow to drive, but he can't connect. Starc searching for the swing there, but didn't get any;
1.6;1;Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 run first runs off the bat as Bairstow punches this length ball into the gap between cover and mid off;
1.5;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run full, and slightly wide, allowing YJB to free his arms. Crunches a drive, but stopped by mid off scurrying to his left;
1.4;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run full on off, and he walks into a front foot defense;
1.3;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run through him! Good length outside off, and coming into off stump. Bairstow wants to defend off the back foot but the ball zoots inwards and goes between bat and body;
1.2;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run full, just outside off, and he takes a big stride to cover off stump, and then shoulders his arms;
1.1;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run good length, on off, and defended off the back foot, with the bat's open face. Bairstow wants the run, but third slip runs across to end that thought;
1.1;1w;Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 wide good length, outside off, and angling further away. Wide given;
0.6;?;Starc to Roy, no run full on off, and he looks to play the straight drive but it makes a weird hollow sound off the bat (a sign of a mistime) as the ball rolls away to mid off;
0.6;1w;Starc to Roy, 1 wide back of a length, on leg stump, and shaping further down. Roy considered flicking it fine...;
0.5;?;Starc to Roy, no run that's five dot balls.;
0.4;?;Starc to Roy, no run length ball on off, and angling further away. Enough room to free his arms to clatter a cut but can't get bat on ball. A lucky escape for Starc, one could say;
0.3;?;Starc to Roy, no run full, on off, and he taps this tentatively off the front foot to mid off;
0.2;?;Starc to Roy, no run nice shape! Good length on off, and getting big on him. Nearly takes the outside edge to the keeper;
0.1;?;Starc to Roy, no run full, just inside the tramlines and left alone by the batsman;

Starc has the new ball. Warner - and mid off - is on "handling the ball" duties
5.12pm Hello and welcome back to the chase. If this was any other side, on a tired batting track, we'd say the chasing team's backs are against the wall, but not when England are the team trying to raze this total down. But the way Mitch Starc ended the Australia innings, if he could bring that momentum into his opening spell and take a wicket or two... then it's game on.Bairstow's doing his final stretches, Roy is standing next to him and the Aussies are all huddled up. Bit cloudy out here too.
