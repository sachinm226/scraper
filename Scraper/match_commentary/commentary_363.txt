Data
Clarke calls it a day after his side have made the perfect start to this Test, winnings the toss and then giving England the runaround with a big total. It all could have been so different had England taken their chances but they have toiled away and now face 21 overs tonight desperately needing to find some form with the bat.

146.4;?;Broad to Harris, no run on the back foot now, Harris punches to cover;
146.3;?;Broad to Harris, no run Broad wants lbw here, it's dipping in towards middle and leg, umpire Dharmasena turns it down but England ask for a review. Well, he has definitely hit the ball, but it's a question of whether his inside edge came just before or just after it hit the front pad. It looks almost simultaneous. Hot Spot doesn't shed much light on which was first. The umpire's call was not out, and there's not enough evidence to suggest that was a clear wrong call, so England lose their review.;
146.2;?;Broad to Harris, no run Harris lifts this one uppishly just short of the catching man at midwicket;

145.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run Haddin tries another windy slog-sweep, but misses this;
144.6;?;Stokes to Harris, no run another bouncer and Harris shapes to hook this, pulls out at the last minute and it sails safely through to Matt Prior;
144.5;?;Stokes to Harris, no run bouncer from Stokes, this one does get up a bit, but Harris is able to duck it;
144.4;?;Stokes to Harris, no run Harris launches a big off-drive this time as Stokes pitches full, but despite being well timed the shot has found mid-off;
144.3;?;Stokes to Harris, no run banged in short again but it doesn't bounce as high as Harris expects, his pull misses and it lobs to the off side off his body;
144.2;4;Stokes to Harris, FOUR runs powerful shot from Harris! He's a muscular man, but that also required timing, and he's pulled Stokes in the air forward of midwicket, it has positively raced to the boundary;
144.1;?;Stokes to Harris, no run Harris punches this to cover, straight to the fieldsman;
143.6;1;Swann to Harris, 1 run quicker ball at 99kph, almost a leg-stump yorker, but Harris picks it and flicks a single through square;
143.5;?;Swann to Harris, no run pushed away to cover point, can't find the gap;

143.2;?;Swann to Harris, no run Harris defends watchfully from off stump;

142.6;?;Stokes to Harris, no run steered away to backward point;
142.5;?;Stokes to Harris, no run driven back to the bowler;
142.4;2;Stokes to Harris, 2 runs not this time though, he's off the mark with a nice back-foot drive through point;
142.3;W;Stokes to Siddle, OUT Stokes has his second wicket, and that was a lovely delivery! He's angled this in and managed to get this ball to straighten a bit, Siddle plays straight and gets a thick edge through to the keeper;Peter Siddle c ?Prior b Stokes 2 (11m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22;
142.2;1;Stokes to Haddin, 1 run clipped away through midwicket and the runs keep ticking over;
142.1;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run again Stokes looks for the yorker, but it's too full and driven to midwicket;
141.6;?;Swann to Siddle, no run leans out of his crease to defend once more;
141.5;2;Swann to Siddle, 2 runs Siddle goes for the sweep now and this one almost gets past him as he walks across the stumps - a bit of glove and this lobs over the keeper;

140.6;1;Stokes to Haddin, 1 run banged in at the hips of Haddin, he clips it away through square to retain the strike;
140.5;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run Stokes looking for the yorker here, but it's a touch full and Haddin drives to mid-on;
140.4;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run fuller length now and Haddin defends;
140.3;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run defended safely this time;
140.2;4;Stokes to Haddin, FOUR runs there's the hundred for Brad Haddin! He's done it with a well-placed pull through midwicket to the boundary. Well played Brad Haddin, that's his fourth in Test cricket and his first in three years, the last one came at the Gabba in the last Ashes series in Australia. He was dropped early here, and caught off a no-ball, but he has certainly made England pay;
140.1;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run Haddin still searching for the hundred, he works the ball to midwicket but finds the fielder;
139.6;?;Swann to Siddle, no run quicker ball, trying to squeeze through the defences of Siddle, but he keeps it out;

139.4;?;Swann to Siddle, no run tossed up outside off and Siddle defends;
139.3;W;Swann to Johnson, OUT and there's another wicket! Johnson has misjudged Graeme Swann's flight, driving uppishly and trying to clear mid-on but it has provided Stuart Broad with one of the simpler catches he will take. Might have been a bit of over-spin from Swann too, well bowled;Mitchell Johnson c Broad b Swann 5 (13m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.46;
139.2;?;Swann to Johnson, no run curving in from around the wicket and Johnson defends;
139.1;?;Swann to Johnson, no run Johnson drives to the off side, can't find a gap;
138.6;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run solid in defence to finish the over;
138.5;4;Stokes to Haddin, FOUR runs another swing from Haddin and another boundary, though this one didn't go where he intended. It's a slash outside off and perhaps a bit closer to him than he expected, his thick edge flies through the vacant first slip region and away for four;
138.4;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run on the back foot and crunches it to mid-off;
138.3;4;Stokes to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin isn't worried about the nervous nineties! He has just lobbed Stokes over mid-on for a boundary, that is such a typical Brad Haddin stroke;
138.2;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run Stokes goes fullish on the pads, Haddin's drive can't beat mid-on;
138.1;?;Stokes to Haddin, no run Haddin on the back foot now, he defends;
137.6;?;Swann to Johnson, no run drifting in from around the wicket, Johnson goes back to defend;

137.3;?;Swann to Johnson, no run tossed up on off stump and Johnson drives to mid-off;
137.2;?;Swann to Johnson, no run pushed away to the leg side;
137.1;?;Swann to Johnson, no run leans forward to defend;
136.6;4;Stokes to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin moves into the nineties now, with a boundary through third man - hard to say if that was quite deliberate as it was a bit edgy, but with no slips in place that was a boundary all the way;
136.5;1;Stokes to Johnson, 1 run Johnson gets off the mark with a tuck off his hips through square leg;
136.4;?;Stokes to Johnson, no run Stokes bangs in a short one now, but Johnson ducks comfortably under it;
136.3;?;Stokes to Johnson, no run Johnson goes back in his crease to defend outside off;
136.2;?;Stokes to Johnson, no run Johnson watchfully pushes to cover;
136.1;W;Stokes to Clarke, OUT what is this? A wicket! Stokes this time has his first Test victim! Clarke has tried to turn this through square leg but a leading edge lobs up to midwicket where Anderson dives forward to take the catch. And relief for Stokes as his foot was safely behind the line this time!;Michael Clarke c Anderson b Stokes 148 (350m 245b 17x4 0x6) SR: 60.4;
135.6;6;Swann to Haddin, SIX runs Haddin goes for the slog-sweep again and just gets away with it! Ben Stokes is at deep midwicket and despite a leap from the rope, he's unable to quite reach it;
135.5;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run clipped away through midwicket as Clarke advances down the pitch again;
135.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run pushed away to the leg side;
135.3;4;Swann to Clarke, FOUR runs and there is the all-time Adelaide sixth-wicket record, as Clarke drives uppishly through mid-off - and I mean through - because Stuart Broad couldn't stop it, he was half expecting it to carry to him for a catch;
135.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run pushed away to midwicket;
135.1;?;Swann to Clarke, no run defended from leg stump;
134.6;?;Panesar to Haddin, no run too short, cut hard but straight to cover;

134.4;?;Panesar to Haddin, no run back foot push to cover from off stump;
134.3;?;Panesar to Haddin, no run yorker length, Haddin digs it out up towards mid-on;
134.2;?;Panesar to Haddin, no run a late cut, Carberry on the scene quickly, Clarke wanted a single, Haddin didn't, the throw comes into the bowler's end and Clarke is back in by a frame on the replay, very very close;
134.1;?;Panesar to Haddin, no run back on the stumps and played into the cover;
133.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run back foot punch to point;
133.5;1;Swann to Haddin, 1 run floated up just outside off and clipped down to long on;
133.4;3;Swann to Clarke, 3 runs waits for this right back on the stumps and plays a delightful late cut that runs down towards third man, Panesar chases back;

129.4;?;Broad to Haddin, no run length ball outside off stump played from the crease into the gully;
129.3;3;Broad to Clarke, 3 runs bumper, Clarke hooks and gets nowhere near hitting it probably, a big top edge runs fine of long leg and Clarke gets away with an error, he took that ball from a long way over his head;

127.5;1;Broad to Clarke, 1 run another drive, this a better stroke but can't escape mid-on;
127.4;4;Broad to Clarke, FOUR runs full length two feet wide of off stump and Clarke chases after it going up and over mid-off, it was a slower ball from Broad and it's nearly worked but Clarke has enough on this to evade Pietersen and get it to the rope to bring up the 150 partnership;
127.3;?;Broad to Clarke, no run very full on the off stump, Clarke forces it up to mid-on;

Shawry: "That is just rubbish umpiring. No doubt Stokes (and other bowlers) have been overstepping and not getting called. Umpires allowing them to bowl over the line encourage them to do so and then create this problem. Terrible umpiring."
I agree with you to some degree Shawry - I would prefer umpires to err on the side of not calling if they're not sure, but there are occasions when it is apparent they are not even watching at all.
 Innings Start
What a wonderful performance from Johnson today, he's taken 7 for 40 in this innings and England are in disarray in this match. His pace was simply too much. Bell is left unbeaten on 72.
Mitchell Johnson has a chat to Channel Nine after the innings and talks about how emotional this is for him, given how many people said he wouldn't play for Australia again.
Tea has been taken and Australia will bat after the break rather than enforcing the follow-on. England had no answers to Johnson's pace in that innings. Twice he was on a hat-trick in that session. Not since West Indies made 130 back in 1997 has a team made so few in their first innings of an Adelaide Test as England have here. Join us after the break to see how Australia approach their second innings with a lead of 398. It will be Alex Winter with you when play resumes.
68.2;W;Johnson to Panesar, OUT gone! Johnson gets the job done immediately! Quick, accurate and takes Panesar's off stump. A little inside edge onto the pad and then it clips back into the stumps and England are all out for 172;Monty Panesar b Johnson 2 (60m 35b 0x4 0x6) SR: 5.71;
68.1;?;Johnson to Panesar, no run immediately Johnson gets one past the bat, it's taken on the thigh and lobs out towards the second slip;
67.6;?;Lyon to Bell, no run tries to dance down again for another one but Lyon drags the length back and Bell has to defend;
67.5;6;Lyon to Bell, SIX runs there's the Bell we saw in the first session today against Lyon! He's advanced and lobbed it over long-on for six, confident, controlled and a good shot;
67.4;?;Lyon to Bell, no run makes Bell play with a straighter one, he defends;
67.3;?;Lyon to Bell, no run prodded to the off side, Bell is watchful here;
67.2;?;Lyon to Bell, no run defended from off stump;
67.1;1;Lyon to Panesar, 1 run tossed up outside off and Panesar has a dabble, his thick edge flies just out of the reach of second slip and he gets himself off strike;

66.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run steered away towards backward point;

64.6;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run solid defence after those short ones, nicely done Monty;
64.5;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run struck again! This time I think Siddle may have got Panesar around the shoulder, that one also didn't get up as much as Panesar thought and he's taken his eyes off the ball and taken it on the right upper arm;
64.4;2lb;Siddle to Panesar, 2 leg byes runs for England here as Panesar ducks into a bouncer! Didn't get up as much as he anticipated and it's clunked off the back of the helmet and flown over Haddin, not enough pace on it to get to the boundary though;
64.3;1;Siddle to Bell, 1 run shorter now and Bell swivels a pull to deep square leg and gives Siddle a look at Panesar;
64.2;?;Siddle to Bell, no run probing outside off and Bell defends with bat and pad close together;
64.1;?;Siddle to Bell, no run solidly defended by Bell;
63.6;?;Lyon to Panesar, no run pushed away towards point;
63.5;?;Lyon to Panesar, no run left alone outside off;
63.4;?;Lyon to Panesar, no run dropped! Oh dear, thick edge from Panesar and Clarke at first slip gets his hands in the wrong position, almost had too much time I think, it's bobbed up off the hands or stomach and fallen safely;
63.3;?;Lyon to Panesar, no run clipped away to mid-on, can't find a way to get off strike;
63.2;?;Lyon to Panesar, no run watchful from Panesar as he leans out to defend;

60.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run solidly defended from off stump now;
60.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run on the hips now, Bell works it to fine leg and decides to hold on to the strike instead of taking the single;
60.4;1w;Siddle to Bell, 1 wide bouncer from Siddle, Bell shapes to hook and then decides against it;
60.3;?;Siddle to Bell, no run Bell pushes away to point and can't add to the score;
60.2;1;Siddle to Panesar, 1 run angled across off stump and Panesar just prods a single through cover to get off the mark and off the strike;
60.1;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run Siddle bangs it in short and Panesar ducks under it;
59.6;6;Harris to Bell, SIX runs Bell really has a swing at this, and this has cleared the rope! Wow! He has just sliced this away over cover and got so much on it that it has gone for six!;
59.5;?;Harris to Bell, no run defended on middle and leg now;
59.4;4;Harris to Bell, FOUR runs boundaries galore in this over - poor ball swinging down leg and Bell just gets enough bat on it to glance it away to fine leg;
59.3;4;Harris to Bell, FOUR runs Bell opens up now, he's decided to have a crack while he can, clears the front foot and launches this over mid-off and it has managed to clear the fielder;
59.2;4;Harris to Bell, FOUR runs Bell reaches his half-century with a classy back-foot cut through point, that races away to the boundary;
59.1;?;Harris to Bell, no run and we have a review for lbw. Harris angled it in and Bell was struck on the back thigh, in line with off stump. Dharmasena's call was not out and it's an umpire's call on the height - Bell survives and Australia have no more reviews;
58.6;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run full and blocked up to mid-off;
58.5;?;Siddle to Panesar, no run another bumper and Panesar is up and down like a yoyo here;

56.1;?;Johnson to Bell, no run full on off stump, Bell pokes at it and very nearly finds short extra cover;
55.6;?;Harris to Panesar, no run another bumper, Panesar ducks and wears one on the arm guard I think, sounded painful;
55.5;?;Harris to Panesar, no run fuller ball, gets out of the way I think and the ball rebounds to first slip, half an appeal but it was straight off the arm guard;
55.4;?;Harris to Panesar, no run bumper, well directed, Panesar ducks;

55.1;?;Harris to Bell, no run back of a length on off stump, blocked into the covers from the crease;
54.6;W;Johnson to Anderson, OUT full and straight and knocks out middle stump! This is fast becoming one of the great fast bowling spells. Full, fast and furious that pierces the gap between bat and pad and takes the top of middle stump. Absolutely perfect from Johnson and he need only look at Anderson this time;James Anderson b Johnson 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
54.5;W;Johnson to Swann, OUT full and wide, Swann swings at it, gets a thick outside edge and Clarke takes a superb catch high over his right shoulder, a fine grab and Johnson has a five-for again. Swann was not going to sit around waiting for a ball to get him out, he chases a full wide one, didn't get his foot right out to meet it and nicks off. Another superb Australian catch;Graeme Swann c Clarke b Johnson 7 (16m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
54.4;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run leg stump on a length, tucked into midwicket and they get a comfortable single;
54.3;3;Johnson to Swann, 3 runs gets this away though, just a touch wider so Swann can free the hands a little more and gets a back foot punch away over extra cover for three;
54.2;?;Johnson to Swann, no run swish and a miss outside off to a ball just back in length but not wide enough to slash as Swann tried their;
54.1;?;Johnson to Swann, no run nasty bumper at 91mph right on the money, Swann just tries to fend it off and pops up a catch to where silly point might have been;
53.6;?;Lyon to Bell, no run driven back to the bowler again;
53.5;?;Lyon to Bell, no run tries to flick back past the bowler with the turn but Lyon dives to his right and saves;
53.4;4;Lyon to Bell, FOUR runs another cover drive and this time it would have needed three Baileys to stop it, beautiful flowing stroke;
53.3;?;Lyon to Bell, no run some turn as Bell tries to flick to leg and gets struck on the thigh pad;
53.2;?;Lyon to Bell, no run floated up outside off, lovely cover drive but Bailey dives and saves really well;
53.1;?;Lyon to Bell, no run leg stump on a length, blocked in the crease;

52.3;?;Johnson to Bell, no run good length on a fourth-stump line, well left;
52.2;4;Johnson to Bell, FOUR runs back of a length around off stump Bell, not content to hang around, uppercuts over the slips and gets four, nice stroke;
52.1;3;Johnson to Swann, 3 runs length ball on leg stump and Swann chips is through a vacant midwicket for a hard-run three;
51.6;1;Lyon to Swann, 1 run Swann meets this on the full on off stump, sweeps to square leg and they take the single, meaning Swann will now face the hat-trick ball;

51.2;?;Lyon to Bell, no run tossed up on leg stump, clipped into midwicket;
51.1;?;Lyon to Bell, no run spins down the leg side and Bell leaves well alone;
50.6;W;Johnson to Broad, OUT haha cleaned him up! What an over from Johnson. Fabulous fast bowling and that is surely one of the great Ashes overs. Fast on a length, Broad stepped across to try and flick to leg but has lost his leg stump. Remarkable stuff, a triple wicket maiden from Johnson! Again, the pace is simple too much for England;Stuart Broad b Johnson 0 (6m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
50.5;W;Johnson to Prior, OUT well four balls is all Prior has lasted because he's felt for one outside off stump and nicked it behind. Two rough shorties followed by one pitched up sliding across him, Prior played forward and followed it outside off, getting a thin edge through to Haddin who claimed the catch down low;Matt Prior c ?Haddin b Johnson 0 (3m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
50.4;?;Johnson to Prior, no run another bumper, 93mph, that whistles past Prior's helmet as he just gets inside it;
50.3;?;Johnson to Prior, no run bumper and Prior didn't really have a clue, wrapped on the chest trying to fend it off to leg and knew nothing about it;
50.2;?;Johnson to Prior, no run full at the leg stump, tucked up to midwicket;
50.1;W;Johnson to Stokes, OUT full at the pads, huge appeal for lbw, not out given, Erasmus reckoned Stokes hit this, it rebounds to point, there's a run taken and the throws ends up going for four overthrows but Clarke reviews the lbw call. Johnson is mighty close on the no-ball but just okay. Replays suggest the delivery was pad first, Stokes hit his pad with the bat and Hawk Eye has it...crashing into middle and leg and Stokes is gone. Johnson quick and straight and once again too good for an England batsman. Nothing Stokes would have ever faced before this bowling. Like Cook, he was simply done for pace;Ben Stokes lbw b Johnson 1 (19m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 8.33;
49.6;?;Lyon to Bell, no run stays around the wicket, bowls outside off stump, Bell dabs this into the covers;
49.5;1;Lyon to Stokes, 1 run full length and driven to mid-off, Stokes wants a single and gets home easily because Harris fumbles, had it not it was a superb run-out chance;
49.4;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run touch short and a chance to get back to cut, on the bounce finds cover point;
49.3;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run similar line and length, Stokes forward playing up the wicket;

47.6;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run again well wide of off but he plays this, safely to cover;
47.5;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run some drift in but too wide of off, and Stokes can leave it;
47.4;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run defended once more;
47.3;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run drifting down leg now and Stokes leans out to defend;
47.2;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run again tossed up on middle and leg, again Stokes defends;
47.1;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run leans forward to defend safely;
46.6;4;Johnson to Bell, FOUR runs Bell goes for a shot shortly before lunch and gets away with it! Shorter of a length from Johnson, Bell punches hard off the back foot and it has flown over gully and away to the boundary;
46.5;?;Johnson to Bell, no run solidly defended from off stump;
46.4;?;Johnson to Bell, no run left alone outside off once again;
46.3;?;Johnson to Bell, no run left alone outside off;
46.3;1w;Johnson to Bell, 1 wide a rarity here - a wide in Test cricket - as Johnson sprays this like the Mitch of three years ago, well wide of off;
46.2;?;Johnson to Bell, no run goes back onto the back foot now and defends again;
46.1;?;Johnson to Bell, no run Johnson comes back for an over before lunch, and Bell defends;
45.6;W;Watson to Carberry, OUT wow! Out of nowhere Carberry has gone! We were one ball away from a fifth straight maiden over and Carberry gets a short one from Watson and goes for the pull, he absolutely creamed it out of the middle of the bat but Warner at forward square leg has thrust the hands down and somehow taken that in his left hand alone;Michael Carberry c Warner b Watson 60 (202m 144b 10x4 0x6) SR: 41.66;
45.5;?;Watson to Carberry, no run left alone outside off again;
45.4;?;Watson to Carberry, no run shorter of a length, Carberry coves off stump and shoulders arms again;
45.3;?;Watson to Carberry, no run Watson angles it in to off stump and Carberry defends;
45.2;?;Watson to Carberry, no run again Carberry shoulders arms, you'd think both these batsmen are playing for lunch with ten minutes to go;
45.1;?;Watson to Carberry, no run Watson is still around the wicket, Carberry is still happy to leave;
44.6;?;Harris to Bell, no run ah, well bowled! Harris goes the short one again but this is straighter and Bell can't get out of the way, but he does well to force it down into the ground - mind you, he did not look entirely comfortable doing so;
44.5;?;Harris to Bell, no run Bell rocks onto the back foot now to punch forward of point but can't find the gap;
44.4;?;Harris to Bell, no run solidly defended again by Bell;
44.3;?;Harris to Bell, no run short again, left alone again;
44.2;?;Harris to Bell, no run fuller now and getting Bell to drive, he finds cover;

40.4;?;Harris to Bell, no run Bell drives confidently enough again but straight to point;
40.3;?;Harris to Bell, no run solidly defended by Bell;
40.2;?;Harris to Bell, no run Bell goes the cut now but this one is too full, or perhaps just stays down a touch as it nips in, and his under-edge goes through to Haddin on the bounce;
40.1;?;Harris to Bell, no run probes outside off to begin, Bell defends;
39.6;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run straight ball now, again it's fairly quick and again Carberry declines to play outside off;

39.4;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run tossed up on off, Carberry leans forward to defend;
39.3;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run turning from outside off further away, it's left alone;
39.2;2;Lyon to Carberry, 2 runs Carberry is good at getting at Lyon's length, shapes to move forward and then rocks back to cut hard forward of point;

38.6;4;Siddle to Carberry, FOUR runs another super shot, this time a cover-drive from Carberry as Siddle probes on that length outside off, he has timed and placed this perfectly through the gap;
38.5;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run this one is on the hips and Carberry steps across his stumps to allow the ball through to Haddin;
38.4;4;Siddle to Carberry, FOUR runs Carberry picks up another boundary, albeit from a slightly edgy stroke as he drives hard outside off and this one flies away between point and gully, along the ground though;
38.3;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run shoulders arms once more outside off;
38.2;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run this time it's straighter and Carberry defends;
38.1;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run Siddle is still around the wicket, angling it in but not making Carberry play;
37.6;6;Lyon to Bell, SIX runs magnificent from Bell. What more can you say? He advances, hits with the spin of Lyon and lofts this over long-on for another six. That is a batsman full of confidence and in full control;
37.5;1;Lyon to Carberry, 1 run Carberry cuts this one as well, a little uppishly, but safely to deep point and that is Carberry's half-century, his first in Tests, well played given the wickets that have fallen around him;
37.4;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run driven towards mid-off and he can't find the gap;
37.3;4;Lyon to Carberry, FOUR runs cracking cut now from Carberry as Lyon drops just a tiny bit short, and Carberry picks up the length and rocks back in his crease to force that forward of point;
37.2;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run lovely drift in from around the wicket, this grips and turns and beats the bat;
37.1;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run Carberry leans forward to defend;
36.6;?;Siddle to Bell, no run solidly defended by Bell now;
36.5;4;Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs strays onto the pads now and Bell clips this nicely square of midwicket and that has run away to the boundary;
36.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run straight from Siddle, straight bat from Bell;
36.3;2;Siddle to Bell, 2 runs Bell is full of confidence against Siddle as well as Lyon, rocks back and pulls hard and high forward of midwicket, a little top-edgy perhaps but safe enough;
36.2;3;Siddle to Carberry, 3 runs good placement from Carberry, moves forward to drive through cover and although it is chased down inside the boundary, he picks up three and moves ever closer to a maiden Test half-century;
36.2;1nb;Siddle to Carberry, (no ball) Siddle probes outside off but Carberry watches it carefully and shoulders arms;
36.1;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run Siddle comes around the wicket to Carberry, who defends;
35.6;?;Lyon to Bell, no run solidly defended now;
35.5;6;Lyon to Bell, SIX runs wonderful shot from Bell! You wouldn't know that he's new at the wicket from this, uses his feet to advance and lofts Lyon cleanly over long-off, beautiful stroke;
35.4;?;Lyon to Bell, no run turning in towards off stump and Bell defends;
35.3;?;Lyon to Bell, no run plenty of flight from Lyon, and plenty of foot use from Bell, who advances and drives hard to mid-off;
35.2;?;Lyon to Bell, no run confident off-drive now from Bell;
35.1;1;Lyon to Carberry, 1 run cuts hard to point and picks up a single;
34.6;2;Siddle to Bell, 2 runs Bell gets off the mark with an edgy sort of a drive just forward of the short catching cover, uppishly struck as well, which had the Australians interested, but safe enough;
34.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run good line on off stump from Siddle and Bell defends carefully with a straight bat;
34.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run drives hard straight back to Siddle, who picks it up sharply;
34.3;W;Siddle to Pietersen, OUT Pietersen takes a little step down the pitch and clips straight to short midwicket and again Pietersen falls right into the trap. George Bailey juggled the chance but held on well and that is the second very weak dismissal this morning. Very very poor indeed from such a great player, flicking right into the trap and now England are in trouble;Kevin Pietersen c Bailey b Siddle 4 (19m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
34.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run oh nicely bowled, this nips back and beats Pietersen on the inside edge, where did that come from? Jagged back and went over off stump;
34.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run length delivery a good distance outside off, left easily alone;
33.6;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run more air to off stump and blocked up the wicket again;
33.5;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run forward on off stump and dabbled up the wicket;
33.4;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run touch short and again played off the back foot, not wide enough of mid-off for a single;
33.3;4;Lyon to Carberry, FOUR runs back to cut and gets it through cover, just a touch short and Carberry punishes it;
33.2;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run few inches outside off, left alone;
33.1;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run touch short and pushed firmly to mid-off;
32.6;2;Siddle to Pietersen, 2 runs full length and driven off a thick inside edge in front of square leg for a couple more;
32.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run length delivery just outside off, left well alone;
32.4;2;Siddle to Pietersen, 2 runs length ball steered away through the slips cordon and Pietersen is away;
32.3;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run Pietersen fiddles at this outside off, Haddin takes it low and appeals immediately, nothing from anyone else but Clarke reviews looking for a faint one. Good chance for the new DRS here, there's nothing on Hot Spot to suggest an edge. Real Time Snicko doesn't have anything either so this will stay not out. Strange review that really with only Haddin interested;
32.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run full and two feet wide of off stump, shouldered arms;
32.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run blocked on a length around off stump;

30.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run long stride just outside off, Pietersen plays in front of gully;
30.4;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run length a foot and a half outside off, left alone;
30.3;1;Siddle to Carberry, 1 run tighter line here and Carberry drops it into cover and calls for a quick single that Pietersen was alive too;
30.2;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run full again, a touch wider here so more easily left;
30.1;?;Siddle to Carberry, no run around the wicket, full length, wide enough of off stump to leave alone;
29.6;W;Lyon to Root, OUT top-edged sweep and find deep square leg can you believe it? All the hard work from Root and he's fallen to a very weak dismissal, that is a cheap surrender and Australia have been gifted the opening breakthrough, what a waste for England. Root was sweeping from well outside off, he was swinging hard and looked like he was going for slog sweep but a bit of bounce - that Lyon often gets - is his downfall;Joe Root c Rogers b Lyon 15 (114m 80b 1x4 0x6) SR: 18.75;
29.5;1;Lyon to Carberry, 1 run played from the crease, gets it off the outer half of the bat backward of point;
29.4;4;Lyon to Carberry, FOUR runs now uses his feet and plays a delightful drive through cover, excellent batting, right to the pitch, weight into the shot and opened the face to get it into the gap;
29.3;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run fuller again and Carberry can drive this time, forced out to cover point;
29.2;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run fuller and nudged up to cover from just outside off;
29.1;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run floated up on the stumps by "Lyno", Carberry plays it back to him;
28.6;?;Johnson to Root, no run weak short ball way down leg;
28.5;1;Johnson to Carberry, 1 run fuller and played in front of backward point, Carberry this time calls Root through for a sharp run and they get home easily;
28.4;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run nicely back on it is Johnson, decent length just outside off, Carberry plays and misses where he should have left it alone;
28.3;4;Johnson to Carberry, FOUR runs full on leg stump, another poor ball, and Carberry brings the fifty up with a flick wide of long leg;
28.2;1;Johnson to Root, 1 run length delivery on off stump, Root drops it in front of point and sets off for a comfortable single, unlike last night Carberry responded quickly enough;
28.1;4;Johnson to Root, FOUR runs full and wide, pleasantly driven for four through the covers, worst ball of the morning and Root put it away;
27.6;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run carefully forward to this and blocking up the wicket;
27.5;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run back and this turns a little and bounces, Carberry tries to drag the bat inside the line but I fancy he was beaten there back on off stump;
27.4;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run forward and dropping this down more comfortably in front of Bailey at silly point;
27.3;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run forward playing in front - only just actually - of silly point, softer hands needed;
27.2;2;Lyon to Carberry, 2 runs swept firmly off the stumps, a bit of a top edge, no-one back at deep midwicket so it's a calculated risk, man at deep square leg runs around to field;
27.1;?;Lyon to Carberry, no run around the wicket, tossed onto the stumps, Carberry forward to block;
26.6;?;Johnson to Root, no run back up to 94mph, full a foot outside off, Root was slow coming forward to it but ran it into the covers;
26.5;?;Johnson to Root, no run 85mph, Root with a chance to flick to leg but only finds midwicket;
26.4;?;Johnson to Root, no run fuller length, straight line, Root defending in the crease again;
26.3;?;Johnson to Root, no run around the wicket which heightens the slingy effect, back of a length on the stumps, blocked;
26.2;?;Johnson to Root, no run wider line, Root punches off the back foot but only as far as cover;
26.1;?;Johnson to Root, no run length on off stump, Root defends back in his crease;
25.6;2;Harris to Carberry, 2 runs too straight from Harris and he gets tucked through square leg for a couple;
25.5;?;Harris to Carberry, no run full length on the stumps, Carberry whips hard but only finds mid-on;
25.4;?;Harris to Carberry, no run wide on the crease angled to middle and off, Carberry tucks with the angle to short leg;
25.3;?;Harris to Carberry, no run back on off stump and blocked up the wicket;
25.2;?;Harris to Carberry, no run angled down the leg side, Carberry had a flick at it and there was a noise, it did carry to Haddin who spilled it with one hand but I'm sure that's thigh pad only;
25.1;2;Harris to Carberry, 2 runs just back of a length, Carberry plays with soft hands around the off stump and runs it down through the vacant third slip area for a couple;
24.6;?;Johnson to Root, no run length on off stump, Root plays from the crease again and dabs towards point;

23.1;?;Harris to Root, no run good length on off stump, Root blocks in the crease;

22.1;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run just a loosener, 87mph, blocked in front of off stump;
21.6;?;Harris to Root, no run slightly shorter length, defended in the crease around off stump;
21.5;?;Harris to Root, no run more of a good length on the off stump, blocked up on the off side;
21.4;?;Harris to Root, no run driveable length, flowing stroke to mid-off;
21.3;?;Harris to Root, no run fuller and wide again, left easily;
21.2;?;Harris to Root, no run tighter line, a touch shorter, dabbed down into the gully;
21.1;?;Harris to Root, no run length ball two feet wide of off stump, left alone;
20.6;?;Johnson to Carberry, no run Carberry survives the last ball, hit on the pads but Australia decide against using a review as that looked to be sliding down leg. Ah, but what have we here? Replays show that in fact was hitting leg! That would have been overturned had Australia asked for a review, Carberry was very fortunate that Australia didn't review that.;
20.5;1;Johnson to Root, 1 run oh, run-out chance?! What are England doing here? Joe Root has nearly sold Carberry down the river from the second-last ball of the day! It's a back-foot push to cover and Root takes off for the single, the throw from Chris Rogers is wide of the stumps but had it hit Carberry was well short!;
20.4;?;Johnson to Root, no run just a touch too wide of off to tempt Root, he left it alone;
20.3;?;Johnson to Root, no run fuller and straighter, Root watches carefully and just defends it straight back down the pitch;
20.3;1nb;Johnson to Root, (no ball) short of a length once more and Root defends - it's a no-ball;
20.2;?;Johnson to Root, no run banged in shorter of a length at 145kph and Root defends off the back foot;
20.1;?;Johnson to Root, no run angles in from around the wicket, Root defends;

So, four maidens on the trot now and England would be happy with one more now, it's the last over before stumps coming up.
 Innings Start
Stumps on day three sees Australia with a 530-run lead and two full days to push for a 2-0 scoreline. You would think Australia will bat on for a little while tomorrow, though probably no more than an hour. Enough time for David Warner to reach his century and enough to make England get in the bowling frame of mind again. Then they'll stick them back in and give themselves five sessions with the ball. The pitch isn't breaking up all that much, though Panesar has found plenty of turn and the odd ball is staying a fraction low. But no real batting demons out there. At least, not unless Mitchell Johnson is bowling. He was the story of today, 7 for 40 he finished up with after a brutally fast spell that annihilated England in the second session. They simply couldn't handle his pace. England look shot, and it will take something miraculous for them to avoid defeat. There will be plenty from our team at the ground - David Hopps, George Dobell, Daniel Brettig and Jarrod Kimber - so keep an eye out over the next few hours. Alex Winter and I (Brydon Coverdale) will join you again in the morning for day four. Thanks for joining us.

34.2;?;Panesar to Smith, no run pushed away to cover and can't beat the field;
34.1;1;Panesar to Warner, 1 run Warner skips a couple of steps down the pitch and lifts this down to long-on, didn't get hold of that though;

33.1;?;Broad to Smith, no run Broad probes outside off at 132.3kph, Smith shoulders arms;
32.6;?;Stokes to Warner, no run angled across and Warner defends from off stump, his thick edge flies away along the ground to gully;

32.2;1;Stokes to Warner, 1 run on the pads now and Warner clips a single through leg;
32.1;4;Stokes to Warner, FOUR runs and Warner welcomes Stokes with a dismissive drive straight back down the ground for four! Uppishly played, but safely wide of the bowler and that sizzles away to the boundary;
31.6;?;Broad to Smith, no run defended away safely to the off side;
31.5;?;Broad to Smith, no run Broad probes outside off, Smith defends;
31.4;1;Broad to Warner, 1 run on the pads and Warner tickles this away through square leg;
31.3;4;Broad to Warner, FOUR runs banged in short of a length and Warner has crunched a pull forward of midwicket, in the air but safely wide of mid-on - can Warner get himself a hundred here?;
31.2;?;Broad to Warner, no run on the back foot now Warner punches to cover;
31.1;?;Broad to Warner, no run Warner cuts but not past cover point;
30.6;3;Anderson to Warner, 3 runs Warner has had enough of defending for now, he's gone for a lofted on-drive and done enough to clear mid-on, but hasn't quite timed it well enough for a boundary, it slows up and is reeled in;
30.5;?;Anderson to Warner, no run fuller length from Anderson, Warner drives on the bounce back to the bowler;
30.4;?;Anderson to Warner, no run angling in towards middle stump, Warner plays back and defends;
30.3;?;Anderson to Warner, no run solid in defence again as Anderson probes outside off;

30.1;?;Anderson to Warner, no run solid in defence on off stump;
29.6;?;Panesar to Smith, no run pushed away to cover point;
29.5;?;Panesar to Smith, no run straight bat from Smith again;
29.4;?;Panesar to Smith, no run drifting onto the toes of Smith, who works it to leg but not through the gap;

28.5;?;Anderson to Warner, no run whipped away to square leg, can't find the gap;
28.4;?;Anderson to Warner, no run Warner is struck on the leg trying to whip a pull through leg, there's interest in an lbw shout from Anderson but it's turned down, and he can't convince Cook to ask for a review. Sailing well over the top;

28.2;?;Anderson to Smith, no run flashes outside off and this one beats the bat;

27.6;?;Panesar to Warner, no run defended back down the pitch;
27.5;?;Panesar to Warner, no run close lbw shout! Turned down by Kumar Dharmasena and England have decided not to review this. It looked relatively tight, hit in line but was it turning too far? Well, we might have some idea if there was a replay but we haven't seen one yet...;

27.3;1;Panesar to Smith, 1 run cut off the back foot between point and cover;

27.1;?;Panesar to Warner, no run defended from just outside off;
26.6;?;Anderson to Smith, no run defended back down the pitch;
26.5;?;Anderson to Smith, no run Smith has been adjudged lbw here, Anderson had it swinging back in and Smith offered no shot. My initial reaction was it may be too high. Smith has asked for a review, and replays suggest that was missing off stump, not moving back in enough. Had it been straight the height would maybe have been just okay, but it wasn't straightening enough and Erasmus has his decision overturned;
26.4;?;Anderson to Smith, no run Smith drives hard but short cover cuts this one off;
26.3;4;Anderson to Smith, FOUR runs vicious cut from Smith as Anderson drops short outside off, Smith finds the gap behind point and this fizzes away to the boundary;

25.1;1;Panesar to Smith, 1 run plenty of men around the bat as England try to maintain the pressure on Smith, he uses his feet and prods past short leg for a quick single;
24.6;?;Swann to Warner, no run Warner rocks back to cut but can't get it through the field;

2.4;W;Anderson to Watson, OUT full and wide, Watson leans out to it and slaps it straight to point and that is a poor stroke. What is he doing there?

2.3;?;Anderson to Watson, no run length down the leg side, flicked at and missed;
2.2;W;Anderson to Rogers, OUT full ball that Rogers comes forward to and edges behind. Something to cheer for England, poor stroke, played on the walk and a thick edge carries through to Prior.

Welcome back folks, Australia are batting again, presumably to allow what is still a fabulous batting surface the chance to deteriorate under rising temperatures. So I would guess they would bat into tomorrow and then leave themselves five and a bit sessions to bowl England out again. Massive deficit for England, good luck James Anderson...
 Innings Start
A rather quick end to the second Test with Australia taking a commanding 2-0 lead. Read all about it with David Hopps and stick around because we'll have the best analysis and reaction from Adelaide shortly with George Dobell, Jarrod Kimber and Daniel Brettig. But from Brydon Coverdale and myself, Alex Winter, thanks for joining us for these past five days and we'll see you in Perth. I'll leave you with this stat - England have never come back from 2-0 down to win an Ashes series.

Here's the Presentation with Mark Nicholas smiling cheerily as only a well-paid anchorman can. Michael Clarke is the winning skipper: "I closed the curtains quickly this morning, the last thing we wanted was rain but thank God for the weather. The follow-on wasn't that tough of a decision because I wanted our bowlers to have a rest. The tough one was not letting David Warner get a hundred but he was more than happy to stand aside of for the team.
"Our catching has improved over a number of year and we have the best throwing coach in the world. The most pleasing thing is finally getting the results our efforts have deserved in the last few months but we've still got a lot of hard work to do to get back to No. 1 in the world and that's our goal."

Alastair Cook is pretty glum again: "On that first day we had an opportunity but we let our chances go with some dropped catches. You don't get too many chances on good wickets and that was the main difference between the sides. We need to look at ourselves and comes back strong.
"We've got to work against Johnson. We have too look at our techniques. One high point is that Root came through the test at No. 3 very well and showed a lot of fight. You've got to work as hard as you can and that's the only thing we can do. It's only us that can make the difference."

Mitchell Johnson is the Man of the Match. "It's a special feeling to be able to back up Brisbane with here. Out bowling attack has been outstanding and I was really excited to be back with them here. The Mo will stay for the rest of the series and I'm still trying to raise 50,000 dollars."

For England well, blown again away with the bat doesn't quite tell the whole story because the top order didn't crumble to Johnson and Carberry, Root and Pietersen showed how it should be done. But it wasn't nearly enough and they far too often squandered opportunities. This was an excellent batting surface and they failed for a second Test in a row. The other big negative was their fielding. Three dropped catches on day one cost them the chance to put Australia under pressure and had they only conceded a lead of 150 on first-innings, things could have turned out differently. They have a lot of soul-searching to do before Perth. Lesson One, put the hook shot in the locker.

It's been a second crushing win for Australia and again this came from
an opening day where the game was in the balance. They were given a few lives with some dropped catches but then capitalised to the full with hundreds from Michael Clarke - again - and Brad Haddin. From there, weight of runs proved too much and the Aussies' big gun, Mitchell Johnson, again roared in to destroy England in the first innings. That was pretty much enough to win the match and a professional job in the preceding two days has closed out victory.

And that's your lot, hasn't taken long today at all for Australia to take the
four wickets they needed. England bashed a few more, Matt Prior going to a badly-needed half century, but never looked even close to getting stuck in and taking this game deep into day five. Australia have won by 218 runs and take a 2-0 lead in the Ashes. They are one win away from regaining the Urn.
101.4;W;Harris to Panesar, OUT length outside off and Panesar slaps it to short extra-cover and Australia have wrapped up a 218 run victory to go 2-0 up in the series. Panesar can't add the resistance of the first innings to the second dig, got a driven off the toe and it was simply pouched by Rogers at hip height;Monty Panesar c Rogers b Harris 0 (13m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

100.4;4;Siddle to Anderson, FOUR runs full length outside off, Anderson swings from the crease and gets enough bat on it through mid-on to collect four, quite an ungainly swing but four nevertheless;
100.3;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run another short delivery, blocked on top of the bounce in front of off stump;
100.2;4;Siddle to Anderson, FOUR runs excellent short ball, bit higher and straighter and Anderson knows little about it, throwing the gloves up to it and punches it down to fine leg;

99.6;?;Harris to Panesar, no run another shortie, Panesar under it easily;
99.5;?;Harris to Panesar, no run short and ducked yet again;
99.4;3;Harris to Anderson, 3 runs good length just outside off and Anderson unleashes a lofted straight drive. Didn't quite time it but a decent thump nevertheless;
99.3;?;Harris to Anderson, no run angled in, Anderson hit on the thigh pad as he looks to flick into the leg side;
99.2;?;Harris to Anderson, no run bumper, well directed, ducked;
99.1;?;Harris to Anderson, no run around the wicket, down leg side, ignored;

98.5;W;Siddle to Prior, OUT short and hooked again and, well, well, well can you Adam and Eve it, picks out deep-backward square leg. England, deary me. Harris the catcher this time.

97.3;W;Harris to Swann, OUT back of a length outside off, Swann pushes hard at it away from his body with a nothing stroke and gets a thick edge to second slip where Clarke bags an easy catch at shoulder height with two hands. The delivery shaped away a touch but started too wide to induce a stroke. Chalk it up as another poor dismissal;Graeme Swann c Clarke b Harris 6 (32m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85;

90.5;W;Siddle to Broad, OUT hooked again and this time Broad puts it right down deep square leg's throat how awfully typical for this batting performance. That is an utter miserable stroke. Banged in again and Broad falls for it hook, line and sinker, slogging it straight to Lyon who barely has to move coming in from the rope. Pretty pathetic that from Broad;Stuart Broad c Lyon b Siddle 29 (32m 26b 3x4 1x6) SR: 111.53;
90.4;6;Siddle to Broad, SIX runs short and pulled, there are two men back but Broad has whacked this straight into the pavilion!;

89.5;?;Johnson to Prior, no run Prior goes back on his stumps to defend;

89.1;?;Johnson to Prior, no run Prior watches this closely and leaves outside off;
88.6;?;Lyon to Broad, no run left alone outside off;
88.5;3;Lyon to Prior, 3 runs half a chance maybe? Prior works this off the legs and Watson at leg slip dives to his right but can't quite get to it - definitely off the bat but Watson couldn't get a hand to it;

87.5;?;Johnson to Broad, no run clipped off the hip, lobs up wide of short leg;
87.4;?;Johnson to Broad, no run 147.7kph and short! Broad folds himself up like a nervous baby giraffe, gets underneath it. I dunno if baby giraffes fold themselves up to avoid dangers but that's what he looked like.;
87.3;1;Johnson to Prior, 1 run here's a chance, is it? No, not quite - Prior has swivel pulled this but off the top edge, and it flies high and out towards square leg, but not far enough to reach Lyon on the full;

87.1;?;Johnson to Prior, no run Johnson angles it across Prior at 140.9kph, he drives towards cover;

85.4;?;Johnson to Broad, no run flashes outside off and this beats the bat, lovely bowling;
85.3;?;Johnson to Broad, no run bouncer! This is what the crowd wanted from Johnson, he bangs it in short at 144kph and Broad doesn't get out of the way, he wears this on the shoulder! Also steps back deep into his crease - a hit wicket is half a chance here;
85.2;2;Johnson to Broad, 2 runs big swing now from Johnson, away from Broad but too wide and he drives comfortably through point;
85.1;?;Johnson to Broad, no run beaten outside off! Oh, Broad prodded at this and missed, it has nipped away from him and not only just missed the bat, only narrowly missed off stump. Phew.;

83.6;?;Johnson to Prior, no run oh boy, this has not missed by much! Prior shoulders arms to a ball that is far too full. That seems a premeditated leave because that was one he should have been playing - only narrowly misses the off stump a few inches up from the ground;
83.5;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run over the wicket now is Johnson and Stokes glances fine;
83.4;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run good one, just around chest height and angled across Stokes, who plays it well by leaving;

82.5;?;Harris to Stokes, no run angled bat as he defends towards mid-off;
82.4;4;Harris to Stokes, FOUR runs lovely on-drive, Stokes has played some nice shots but this is the best one yet, just times it to perfection, a punchy sort of drive that races away through mid-on;

81.2;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run Johnson beats the bat now, good line and length at 146kph, draws Stokes into a tentative push outside off and this fizzes past the edge;
81.1;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run just swinging down leg side, Stokes doesn't play;
80.6;?;Harris to Prior, no run beaten outside off! Lovely ball from Harris, angles in and then swings away late, Prior's drive misses;

75.1;?;Lyon to Prior, no run around the wicket to Prior, who goes back deep to defend;
74.6;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run Bailey in the action again! This is probably a dropped chance, if we're being hard on him. Very, very tough! Stokes whipped it hard off the legs and it hits Bailey in the midriff, then he can't quite get the hands under it. Split-second stuff there;
74.5;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run ouch! Bailey at short leg cops one on the leg as Stokes goes for the big hook and gets it down into the ground;

72.6;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run back foot punch aimed at the covers comes off a bottom edge into the ground;
72.5;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run you know what I was saying about Australia's luck being in, well this could be a catch off the boot of short leg, a flick to leg bounced up to Rogers at midwicket but the replay shows this to have hit the ground, that would have been a miserable way to get out;

69.6;4;Harris to Stokes, FOUR runs yorker length just outside off, Stokes digs it back to the bowler who shies at the stumps and throws miles past the keeper! Four overthrows for no reason at all!;
69.5;?;Harris to Stokes, no run very full and Harris cries for lbw thinking again that it might be pad first in front of off stump, I think it was pad first but Australia are out of reviews and that would have been out;

67.1;?;Harris to Stokes, no run good length on off stump, Stokes is forward and running it back to the bowler;

65.3;?;Harris to Stokes, no run straighter on a length, Stokes forward and defending this more solidly;
65.2;?;Harris to Stokes, no run fuller and Stokes is very late on it, clips the pad outside the line I reckon, they go up for caught behind too, not out given but Clarke reviews again. I'm sure he didn't hit it, got beaten on the inside edge, the ball flicks the flap of the back pad and that it outside the line of off stump and missing, so not a great review at all. Second one burned.;

Little unlucky there but throughout the match fortune has favoured Australia and they've deserved their luck too.

59.6;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run full length, tails into off stump again, Stokes struck with bat and pad together, cry for lbw, not out given and Clarke reviews thinking this might be pad first. No-ball is tight but okay. And Stokes has smashed it onto his front pad so not the best review;
