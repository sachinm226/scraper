Data
Another good performance from Australia in the field and with the ball. They took wickets at crucial times, just as New Zealand started to build partnerships, as they have done right throughout the series.
Johnson and McKay both took two wickets but it was a good all-round performance from Australia to contain the hosts to 241.
New Zealand's batsmen again failed to make the most of their starts, with Styris top scoring with 55.
Join us in just under 30 minutes for Australia's chase.

Hello and welcome to Wellington for the 5th ODI between New Zealand and Australia. This match is effectively a dead-rubber but the hosts really need to put up a spirited performance to satisfy their fans and to gain some confidence heading towards the Test series.
Ricky Ponting has won his 6th toss in a row and Australia will bowl first.
Today's forecast is for mainly fine weather and a temperature of 19 degrees C. Fortunately, the mini-tornado that blew through Wellington yesterday hasn't hampered the pitch preparation, however we should see some early seam movement which should further test New Zealand's unstable top order.
In team news, Clint McKay comes in for Ryan Harris, who is being rested ahead of the Test series and Nathan McCullum replaces James Franklin as New Zealand has opted to take two spinners into today's match.
Ricky Ponting says his team face no issues in getting up for this dead-rubber as his team is used to them and guys will need to keep performing to maintain their place in the side.
Daniel Vettori feels as though he has been saying the same things all series interms of what his side needs to do to put the pressure back on Australia and give their bowlers something to bowl at.
New Zealand needs to lift their performance markedly if they are to test Australia today.
I am Marc Ellison and I look forward to bringing you the live commentary of today's 5th anf final ODI from the Chappell-Hadlee series.
We are just under 15 minutes away from the first ball.
Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill walk out to face Clint McKay with the new ball.
 Innings Start
