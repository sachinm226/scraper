 Innings Start
10pm Looks like Imran Tahir is not coming out to bat, he has an injury, and Australia have won by 73 runs, series lead 2-1. Their bowlers started very well, both Hazlewood and Starc. Amla was fighting for South Africa with a hundred, they had a chance till de Villiers was there, but Australia prevailed once again. The next match is on Melbourne now, on Friday. Till then, goodbye and good luck!
Max: "South Africa manage to have the best no.5 in the world and still have a fragile middle order. Doesn't say much for AB's colleagues"
Sangit: "All wicket for seamer??? Is it so??" Absolutely!
Steven Smith is the Man of the Match: Finch laid the foundation early which was good for a big score. I had a pretty free reign to do whatever i wanted [about his flicks on the leg side]. We all practice hard in the nets for such shots and that's how we get better, that's how it comes out in the game. The boys bowled very well, in the right spots even after the ball got soft and it started to reverse. Hazlewood is outstanding these days and it's great to see Starcy back as well with some wickets.
