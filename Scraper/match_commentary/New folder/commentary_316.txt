6.10 pm This is a very decent score on this SCG pitch. There's been something in it for the quicks all through and Sri Lanka will have to bat sensibly to chase this down and win the series. No doubt Starc will come out firing with the ball after his brilliance with the bat. I'll be back in 30 minutes for the chase. See you then.

13.1;?;Kulasekara to Warner, no run Warner, who's been camped at the other end, hits a short of a length ball to cover;
12.6;?;Malinga to Bailey, no run Malinga tries to swing it away from the right-hander from a straighter line but doesn't get the ball to move as much, Bailey finally gets bat on ball as he moves forward and defends, the SCG crowd gives him a cheer;
12.5;?;Malinga to Bailey, no run he's been beaten four times in a row by the one that moves away late, Malinga must be wondering what he needs to do to hit that outside edge;
12.4;?;Malinga to Bailey, no run this is some special bowling from Lasith, another one beats the outside edge after angling into the right-hander, pitching around off and moving away late;
12.3;?;Malinga to Bailey, no run What a ball that is, Malinga pitches on a great length around off stump and gets it to move ever so late to beat the outside edge of Bailey's forward defence;
12.2;?;Malinga to Bailey, no run he gets beaten by one that pitches on a good length outside off and seams away from the right-hander;
12.1;W;Malinga to Hussey, OUT Thirimanne's caught it after a juggle at first slip! Malinga bowled a beautiful outswinger, pitching around off and moving away. Hussey, having been peppered by the short stuff, stayed back and prodded away from his body, nicking it to Thirimanne's left. He caught it, lost grip but grabbed it again before falling to the ground.;David Hussey c Thirimanne b Malinga 1 (11m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.11;
11.6;?;Kulasekara to Warner, no run that's hit him where it hurts most and Warner's down on his knees. That ball wasn't short enough to pull and Warner tried to short-arm pull it through square. Not sure whether that hit him off the inside edge but Warner needs a couple of minutes to gather himself. That hit him flush on the box off the bottom edge.;

11.4;?;Kulasekara to Warner, no run good length on middle and off, Warner defends on the off side;

10.3;?;Malinga to Hussey, no run another short ball, which is a bit easier to leave;
10.2;?;Malinga to Hussey, no run what a ball that is, Hussey did superbly to get out of the way. Malinga got the ball to rear up sharply from just short of a length, Hussey smelled that as he leapt back and swayed out of the way.;
10.1;1;Malinga to Warner, 1 run short of a length into the body, Warner plays the short-arm pull behind square;
9.6;W;Kulasekara to Clarke, OUT Clarke's been given lbw and he's asked for a review too. Kulasekara hit the pad with a big inswinger, it moved sharply into Clarke off the seam. Clarke was pushing forward and was hit in line too. Replays indicate the ball would have clipped the top of middle. He's got to go.;Michael Clarke lbw b Kulasekara 20 (38m 20b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100;
9.5;?;Kulasekara to Clarke, no run defended from the crease;

8.6;?;Malinga to Warner, no run Malinga responds with a yorker that Warner digs out on the leg side;
8.5;4;Malinga to Warner, FOUR runs shot! He's ramped it over the keeper and the cordon. Warner swayed out of the line of the short of a length ball and angled his bat so the ball could bounce off the middle and fly to the third man boundary;
8.4;?;Malinga to Warner, no run the slower ball outside off, Warner had moved forward and waited for it, before driving to cover;
8.3;?;Malinga to Warner, no run Warner hits the length ball hard off the front foot, the fielder at cover dives to his right to make the stop;
8.2;1;Malinga to Clarke, 1 run Clarke moves forward and turns the length ball through square leg;
8.1;?;Malinga to Clarke, no run played off the back foot towards point;

7.4;?;Kulasekara to Warner, no run that's rash, Warner tries to drive away from his body and is beaten by a big away swinger;
7.3;2;Kulasekara to Warner, 2 runs look at the timing on that! Warner simply moved forward and punched at a length ball going away from him, it screamed through cover point, and Jeevan Mendis just about caught up with it;
7.2;?;Kulasekara to Warner, no run good length, pitches around off and seams away from Warner, who watches it go past;
7.1;4;Kulasekara to Warner, FOUR runs Warner's blasted this off the front foot, the length was a bit too full outside off and Warner flayed it past mid-off with a fierce drive;

6.2;?;Malinga to Warner, no run he tries to hit the good length ball through cover but the room isn't there for the shot, he gets an inside edge on the leg side;
6.1;?;Malinga to Warner, no run he starts with a slower ball on a tight length and line, Warner was on the front foot a little early and he defends back to the bowler;
5.6;1;Kulasekara to Warner, 1 run Warner stays back and gets squared up by one that pitches leg and seams across the left-hander, he gets an outside edge that goes along the ground behind point;
5.5;?;Kulasekara to Warner, no run a third appeal for lbw in the over but umpire Reiffel is unmoved again. I think that pitched outside leg stump, but Mahela has asked for a review. He seemed to ask Kulasekara whether it pitched in line and the bowler seemed to indicate that it did. I did not. It pitched well outside leg and wouldn't have hit the stumps anyway. A horrid review from Sri Lanka.;
5.4;?;Kulasekara to Warner, no run Warner stays in his crease and defends on the leg side;
5.3;1lb;Kulasekara to Clarke, 1 leg bye another appeal for lbw but I suspect the ball was missing leg this time. Clarke moved forward and across to try and flick a full ball that swung into him, and was hit on the pad;
5.2;?;Kulasekara to Clarke, no run another loud appeal for lbw but the umpire Paul Reiffel says not out. Mahela decides not to review. Kulasekara got the ball to nip back into Clarke from outside off, Clarke had got his front pad outside the line of off stump so that wouldn't have been reversed;
5.1;1;Kulasekara to Warner, 1 run tucked off the hips towards square for a sharp single;
4.6;2;Angelo Mathews to Clarke, 2 runs Clarke's timing is superb, he simply pushes a ball that angles into him through wide mid-on, giving Malinga some running to do;
4.5;1;Angelo Mathews to Warner, 1 run pushed into the off side for a quick single;
4.4;4;Angelo Mathews to Warner, FOUR runs he's timed this alright, width outside off stump and Warner slashes hard to cut the short ball to the point boundary;
4.3;2;Angelo Mathews to Warner, 2 runs short of a length outside off and Warner drags it from all the way there with a flat-bat and pulls it over mid-on, didn't time it at all and the ball plugs in the outfield;
4.2;?;Angelo Mathews to Warner, no run that ball came back into the left-hander, Warner wanted to drive on the off but adjusted his shot into a defence;
4.1;3;Angelo Mathews to Clarke, 3 runs once again Mathews is too straight to Clarke and the batsman flicks the ball into the huge expanse of vacant outfield at deep midwicket;
3.6;?;Kulasekara to Warner, no run wider outside the off stump, Warner lets it go;
3.5;?;Kulasekara to Warner, no run a huge appeal for lbw but the umpire says not out. Warner got an inside edge on to the pad as he pushed forward to defend. Looked like the ball hit both pad and inside edge around the same time. Pitched outside leg stump too;

2.4;4;Angelo Mathews to Clarke, FOUR runs once more, Clarke gets on to the front foot as the ball begins to move away from him and drives fluently through cover, hitting the ball all along the ground;
2.3;?;Angelo Mathews to Clarke, no run defended on the front foot towards point;
2.2;4;Angelo Mathews to Clarke, FOUR runs shot, Clarke! He strides forward to a length delivery outside off and caresses the ball through cover with a flowing drive. That ball moved away from the right-hander a little;
2.1;1;Angelo Mathews to Warner, 1 run glanced off the pads behind square for a single, Mathews is a bit too straight to the left-hander from over the wicket;

Gareth: "I'm surprised Chandimal has the gloves. He's struggled with injury of late and Kusal was highly impressive behind the stumps so far."
 Innings Start
9.00 Very unexpected news from the SCG, the game has been called off. Loud boos from an enthusiastic SCG crowd as they hear the news over the PA system. There's been no rain for 45 minutes, and it didn't rain for very long and it wasn't very heavy either. So I'm quite surprised by this decision.
Michael Clarke: "As you can hear the crowd is very disappointed, it was nice of them to stick around. Having said that we wanted to play .. have a crack at winning the game ... we have to take the umpires' judgement ... it was completely up to the umpires. We thought there was going to be enough in the wicket ..."
The Sri Lankans go to the section of the SCG filled with their supporters and give them a wave.
"Due to the poor condition of the outfield the match has been abandoned," says the message on the large screen at the SCG. Why didn't they cover more of the SCG then?
Devalochana: "This is amazing... Back here in SL we have heaps of rain and still have games played since we cover the entire grounds. Shocking to see that Australian grounds are like this..!"
Rob Noah: "Dont quite remember this happening in.. well, since I've been watching cricket. I simply imagine there are massive puddles and potholes my eyes cannot detect."
Micka: "Marius Erasmus and Paul Reiffel are not popular in Australia at the moment. Not only did they give Warner and Henriques out LBW when they hit the ball, they have called off the game 45 minutes after rain stopped falling because the outfield was slightly damp. Maybe the umpires should have thought about the fans who were waiting for over 2 hours for play to resume before they decided to make another bad decision. No wonder ODIs are on the way out...."
Well that's all we have for you today. Sri Lanka lead the series 2-1 and can't lose it now as the teams head to Hobart for the final ODI. An unexpected and rather inexplicable end today, ruined what could have been an absorbing chase.
Thank you for all your emails and thank you for your patience. Do join us on January 23 for the fifth and deciding ODI. Cheers.
8.30 pm The stumps have been put back in at the SCG. However, the umpires have inspected the conditions and word is they haven't decided on a resumption time yet. They want to let the ground dry out some more.
8.10 pm Looks like the crowd is dancing to the YMCA ... and it looks like the umpires are going to inspect the edges of the square for dampness in about ten minutes. They are taking a rope across the outfield and the super sopper is at work too, to take the surface water off.
Chris: "Have the crowd done the YMCA song yet? Well done on the beer snake...and cant we just give SL the win - they were 4-0 after 2 overs and Oz were 4-1...match sorted..."
The covers are coming off too, so not too far from a re-start.
8.00 pm The rain has stopped at the SCG and the groundstaff are having a look at the damage it's caused.
"The SCG crowd has apparently broken the record for the longest beer-cup snake. It went the length of the Victor Trumper Stand," says our correspondent Dan Brettig, who is at the venue.
Gareth: "Australia's chances droop with every over that's lost. They'll need to remove the openers almost immediately."
The umpires are out there speaking to Tom Parker, the SCG curator. The square is still covered.
7.30 pm No improvement in the weather at the SCG. Still drizzling.
7.15 pm Still drizzling at the SCG. And Caron writes in with not-so-good news: "@vignesh- i live about 3km from the SCG and its pouring cats and dogs over here ... doesn't look like its gonna stop anytime soon."
6.55 pm Mahela backs away as the bowler approaches the crease. I think he's saying the drizzle is impairing his vision, I can't be sure though. And they are going off. It's got a bit heavier. The groundstaff bring on the covers.
vignesh: "It should be a passing shower. I'm staying 15kms north of the stadium and it is quite clear here. I don't think D/L would be a case today"
