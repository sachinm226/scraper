3.00pm The players are in the middle, and we're all set to go. It's going to be Mohammad Irfan to run in with the first of the two new balls, and Aaron Finch to take strike. And we have a delay before the first ball. Issues with the sightscreen. The mechanism that hides the sponsor's logo seems to be stuck.
Shaheryar: "Only five bowlers and Anwar Ali's one of them. So whats the backup plan if he starts getting smashed all over the place?"
2.45pm If you're wondering why your commentary feedback isn't appearing, it's because we seem to be having problems receiving it. Keep sending in your thoughts, and we'll have them up as soon as this issue is resolved.
2.30pm Toss time! But before that, a look at the pitch. Dean Jones - he's everywhere, that man - says all the grass has been shaved off the surface, and it has a sheen to it. He says it could be a 300 pitch, but adds that no chasing team has scored more than 285 here. Win the toss, bat first is his prescription.
George Bailey calls heads, it is heads, and Australia have chosen to bat. Misbah-ul-Haq says there could be dew, "so it might be good for us to bowl first."
The teams: So there are two debutants today. One's Sean Abbott, and the other is the 35-year-old Zulfiqar Babar. He's played two Tests and seven T20s for Pakistan, but this is his first ODI. Sarfraz Ahmed is in for Pakistan, and it looks like Asad Shafiq will open. Sohaib Maqsood isn't in the eleven, which is a bit of a surprise to me.
Pakistan: Ahmed Shehzad, Asad Shafiq, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Akmal, Fawad Alam, Sarfraz Ahmed, Shahid Afridi, Anwar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Zulfiqar Babar, Mohammad Irfan.
A few changes for Australia since the final of the tri-series in Zimbabwe. David Warner is fit again, and Phil Hughes makes way for him. Mitchell Marsh is injured, of course, and Abbott replaces him, while Kane Richardson has come in for Mitchell Starc.
Australia: Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith, George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Brad Haddin, Sean Abbott, Mitchell Johnson, Kane Richardson, Nathan Lyon.
AB: "@Jiten: It is not just one bowler. Narine and Ajmal are the go-to men of their respective captains. Their absence messes up the bowling options. Remove Steyn from the SA attack see the difference it creates. "
2.10pm Dean Jones is giving Sean Abbott a new cap. It can be safely surmised, I suppose, that Abbott is about to make his ODI debut.
Zubair-uddin: "Opening the batting should not be a problem for Pakistani lineup. The best choice, I guess would be Asad shafiq. He is not only a good technical player against new ball. But he also used to open batting in his debut years of first class back in 2007-08 and come in one down in List A"
1.35pm Okay. I have a feeling we may have got our match timings wrong. Not sure just yet, but I think the scheduled start is later than we initially thought. We'll confirm as soon as we know. Yup. Match begins at 3.00pm local time.
Jiten Surtani: "Its amazing how the presence or absence of just one individual in a team of eleven affects the pre-match winning chances of a team ! When Narine had to be left out of KKR in CLT20, suddenly doubts were raised on the strength of the team who had won 14 games consecutively ! Similarly, its a bit surprising to see the absence of Saeed Ajmal so seriously affect Pakistan team, a country known for producing great bowlers!"
1.15pm Afternoon, everyone. After a fairly underwhelming performance in the T20 game the other night, Pakistan will want to rebound quickly and begin the ODI series positively. After using a quite experimental batting line-up in that T20 game, it looks like they will return to a more familiar set of faces, but their challenge is still fairly stiff, without Saeed Ajmal, against a strong Australia side. As Brydon Coverdale has written in his preview, Australia will be delighted they won't have to face Ajmal.
Pakistan have a few interesting names in their squad. One I'm particularly interested in is Sarfraz Ahmed. Does his inclusion mean Umar Akmal will play as a specialist batsman? And who will open in the absence of Hafeez?
 Innings Start
That is all we have from this match. Good night
George Bailey: "15-20 runs short with the bat, outstanding effort with the ball. Selling the batting a little bit short there, we were pretty good with the bat too. Started to turn a bit, our spinners were effective, good pace from the quicks, backed up well in the field. Couple of very quick balls tonight (from Johnson). Felt Richard had some nice pace as well."
Steven Smith is the Man of the Match. Smith: "Trying to spend time in the middle, get the ones and twos, hit the bad balls, that was pretty much my plan. That is what I have been working on (pacing my innings). That is what I was able to do, and the others batted around me. Hopefully few more opportunities (at No 3) and few more big scores."
Misbah-ul-Haq: "The kind of batting performance we have had, need to do a lot of things. Nobody is getting scores right from the top. That is a big worry for us. Need to come in the next game with a positive attitude."
What a thorough win for the Australians. It was supposed to be a trial by spin for them but so far it is Pakistan who are getting spun out. Lyon was outstanding on a turner, Maxwell chipping in as well and the pace of Johnson nipping out three too
Emad: "This is what you get for only playing against Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka...Absolutely zero chances in the WC"
