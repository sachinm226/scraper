11.25am Innings break Marsh walks off to warm applause holding the ball aloft for his first Test five wicket haul. What a superb performance from a much maligned player. England are all out six runs shy of 300. Hard to know what kind of score that is. It looks well under par but we shall see. One suspects if Smith gets started it will be. Buttler played beautifully to extend the innings with Leach's support but England failed to capitalise on a great platform. It's over to Stuart Broad and Jofra Archer to try and continue to torment David Warner and Marcus Harris.
Rahman: "So let me get this right.. Pat Cummins who bowled his heart out through out the series didn't have the luck to get a five wicket haul.. Marsh comes in as a cover and gets 5? Cruel!!"
Richard Demarch: "Biggest question now is whether Smith can get more runs than England."
William Rajan: "The highest number of Englishmen in double figures I've seen in a while... every cloud "
How does England's total rate on a scale of well under par to Steven Smith can make 300 himself. Vote in the Live Report

70.5;?;Hazlewood to Leach, no run fired down the leg side;
70.4;W;Hazlewood to Archer, OUT perfection from Hazlewood! No tailender in the world is going to negotiate that... probing line, shaping in on off stump, seaming half a bat's width away, and sure enough, that half a bat is all that it needs for Paine to gather a slender curling edge!

57.1;?;Marsh to Buttler, no run appeal for caught down leg given not out. Australia review. Buttler looks worried. It was on the hip he was trying to glance but he has missed it and it clipped the hip on the way through to Paine. Not out remains. Australia burn a review;
56.6;1;Cummins to Buttler, 1 run inside edge through his legs! 89mph, good length nipping back, he had no idea, just prodded the bat in hope and it cannoned off the inside edge through his legs to fine leg;

56.4;?;Cummins to Buttler, no run huge inswinger, 88mph, but it shapes way down leg;

56.2;?;Cummins to Buttler, no run 85mph, back of a length, nipping back and he leaves on length. It was wide of off;
56.1;W;Cummins to Root, OUT bowled him! Another cracker from Cummins. Wider on the crease, angled in, it hits a good length, straightens a touch and Root is squared up on the crease, beaten on the outside edge and it crashes into off stump! Three quarters of the way up! Not dissimilar to the Old Trafford delivery;Joe Root b Cummins 57 (218m 141b 3x4 0x6) SR: 40.42;
55.6;?;Marsh to Bairstow, no run 84mph, back of a length, fourth stump line, he defends on the front foot;

55.2;?;Marsh to Root, no run 83mph, nice shape, he defends without a huge stride, getting a thick inside edge onto his pad;
55.1;?;Marsh to Root, no run good length, top of off, he's back and across and covering up in defence;

53.6;?;Marsh to Root, no run good length, some shape away, he plays a textbook forward defence, under his eyes;
53.5;?;Marsh to Root, no run good length, some outswing, he defends off the back foot pushing towards point;
53.4;?;Marsh to Root, no run short and down leg, he shapes to pull but elects to leave;

53.2;?;Marsh to Root, no run 83mph, full and swinging very wide of off, he leaves, Paine dives full length to save it;

Pat Cummins to start after tea. Two slips in
3.55pm Almost ready to go after tea. There is 38 overs to bowl in the last session. We will need the extra 30 minutes.
Scott: "Root is working hard to surpass Burns as the most fortunate innings I've seen. Not there yet, but a few more plays and misses and a couple more edges may see him eek top spot" He's making the most of it.
Glen: "Great First Test Innings Batting Display so far from England - considering what we have witnessed lately."
 Innings Start
6.04pm Crumbs... well, what do we know eh? A very handy lead of 69 for England, on a pitch that, to judge by the lack of bounce that scrambled Smith's brain for his rare dismissal, is going to get a bit up-and-down as the match wears on. But there's a tricky 20 minutes yet for England to negotiate. I wonder if Leach is padding up yet? Or if Burns is regretting the screamer that is about to send him out to face Cummins and Hazlewood once more...
Gupta Ji: "Steve Smith is a great player definitely among one of all time greats but isn't' his current form over hyped. I remember there was time when bolwers had no answer to Alister Cook, if you look at his record around 2013 won't imagine he will short of sachins record by such a good margin . Similarly there was a peak for Pointing. In fact scahin won't have seen down fall in form at end of his career, he himself would have around 2000 runs extra with another 10 hundred ." No, I'm not sure it's possible (or legal) to over-hype an average of 65 that is still rising after a decade of international cricket ...



68.5;W;Archer to Siddle, OUT outstanding snaffle from Burns in the gully! That is stunning, reminiscent of Stokes at Trent Bridge in 2015! Full length to his right, stretching so low that he was almost reaching behind him by the time it reached him. Pace does the trick for the tail once more, as Archer leads England off with his second six-for of the series!;Peter Siddle c Burns b Archer 18 (72m 39b 2x4 0x6) SR: 46.15;
68.4;?;Archer to Siddle, no run nip off the seam, sharp and straight, into Siddle's thighpad;
68.3;?;Archer to Siddle, no run attempted yorker, but fired past the leg stump this time;
68.2;1;Archer to Hazlewood, 1 run banged in short, fenced to slip, and dropped by Root! Bafflement all round. Did that hit the grille, no? The glove... straight off the nose either way, and first slip was completely wrong-footed. Nope, grille it was, even though the run was given.;
68.1;W;Archer to Lyon, OUT beautiful yorker! Archer reaches into his ODI box of tricks, a perfect little doodlebug of a knuckleball, 20mph off his top pace, fingers hidden behind the seam as if switching off the motors to glide to its target, and crashes into the off stump, right on the creaseline, to complete a richly deserved five-for! Lyon had no answer whatsoever, but that was a superb counterattacking cameo that has eaten into a dangerous deficit;Nathan Lyon b Archer 25 (31m 30b 4x4 1x6) SR: 83.33;
67.6;1;Leach to Lyon, 1 run six sweeps out of six, and Archer at fine leg does the needful;
67.5;?;Leach to Lyon, no run yep, you guessed it, a sweep, straight to the man on the 45, who gathers well to prevent the single;
67.4;?;Leach to Lyon, no run another sweep, the fourth in a row. Bairstow intercepts with a shimmy;
67.3;1;Leach to Siddle, 1 run swept again, to backward square again. Measured so far in this over;
67.2;1;Leach to Lyon, 1 run swept again, a defensive line to the aggressive Lyon. Backward square tidies up and they take the single;
67.1;?;Leach to Lyon, no run outside leg, Lyon climbs into a sweep, but can't connect properly;
66.6;?;Archer to Siddle, no run short again.Siddle decides discretion etc ... and ducks;
66.5;1;Archer to Lyon, 1 run short, pulled, top-edged, swirling to Leach ... who drops it! He made good ground, eyes on the ball, and actually had the ball under control until his elbows wrecked everything. And that is Archer's five-for gone for the moment...;
66.4;?;Archer to Lyon, no run sharper from Archer, as you'd imagine, and zipping through to the keeper;
66.3;4;Archer to Lyon, FOUR runs clattered through the covers! Stand-and-deliver stuff from Lyon, like a less demonstrative Darren Gough at Sydney. Clearing the feet, freeing the hands, spanging it like a forehead with a frying pan;
66.2;?;Archer to Lyon, no run short, sharp, fizzing down the leg side, Bairstow does well to reach it with a dive;
66.1;1;Archer to Siddle, 1 run opens the face on a full-length delivery, pushed with composure into the gap at point;
65.6;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run right behind the line this time, and pressed back down the pitch;
65.5;6;Woakes to Lyon, SIX runs spanked over square leg for six! Woakes fires in the short ball, Lyon knew it was coming, and raises his front leg like a right-handed, tailended Lara to deposit him into the stands!;
65.4;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run a more conventional tail-end mow across the line. Siddle has a word...;
65.3;4;Woakes to Lyon, FOUR runs pumped on the up, over mid-off! Deep in the crease, anticipating the bouncer, so Lyon makes a virtue of his weight being back in the crease, and swings for the hills with oodles of bottom hand!;
65.2;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run wide enough to play inside the line as Woakes finds more nip off the seam;
65.1;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run beaten on the back foot as Lyon plays over the top of a cramped punch;
64.6;?;Archer to Siddle, no run back on that probing length, targetting the off stump, and duly blocked;
64.5;?;Archer to Siddle, no run a wildly predictable bouncer. Drive that, sunshine! Siddle doesn't. But he does duck;
64.4;4;Archer to Siddle, FOUR runs times the pants off a square drive! Just a fraction too much width, and just full enough to reward a fling of the arms. Lovely intent;
64.3;?;Archer to Siddle, no run yorker, full, straight and 87mph. Well dug out with a stab of the toe of the bat;
64.2;?;Archer to Siddle, no run back of a length, shaping towards off, and solidly blocked on the back foot;
64.1;?;Archer to Siddle, no run sharp and angling into the pads, a leading edge out to that man in the covers;
63.6;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run yee-har! Lyon thought that was in his slot, and had a wipe. It, err, wasn't;
63.5;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run back of a length, and big nip off the seam. Too short to snag the edge, but looked dramatic;
63.4;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run fired down the leg-side, can't connect on that one;
63.3;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run standing tall on the drive, 83mph from Woakes, which isn't much sharper than Curran. Mid-on gathers;
63.2;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run nudged to the leg side;
63.1;3;Woakes to Siddle, 3 runs open-faced crash out to deep cover, Siddle is showing excellent intent to whittle away the deficit. Full again from Woakes;
62.6;?;Archer to Lyon, no run down on one knee for a hopeful drive, not quite there for the shot;
62.5;?;Archer to Lyon, no run leaning back for the uppercut, but can't make contact on a feisty lifter;
62.4;?;Archer to Lyon, no run tucked into the leg side as Archer strays onto the pads;
62.3;?;Archer to Lyon, no run up on the toes, that's well played as Archer bends his back on the short ball, outside off;
62.2;3;Archer to Siddle, 3 runs a loose-wristed, flashy drive along the ground through the covers. Good intent from the tail, chipping away at the deficit, clawed back on the edge of the rope;
62.1;?;Archer to Siddle, no run back of a length, rising into the splice at 85.8mph. A sharp loosener that Siddle plops at his feet;
61.6;4;Woakes to Lyon, FOUR runs he's trying too hard now... too much width on a full length, and a kitchen-sink square drive fizzes to the rope. Four-balls abound for the leaky Woakes, but that was a ... moment;
61.5;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run worked to the leg side with a tuck off the toes;
61.4;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run nip on a good length, shaping into the pads, Woakes has his tail up, understandably;
61.3;4;Woakes to Lyon, FOUR runs width, hard hands, airborne for a while but wide of gully ... every run counts;
61.2;?;Woakes to Lyon, no run lovely delivery to greet the new man! Back of a length, nipping just a touch before it reached Lyon, then curling past the edge. This is getting interesting;
61.1;W;Woakes to Smith, OUT he's walked across his stumps and Smith has missed a straight one! STEVEN SMITH HAS MISSED A STRAIGHT ONE! Oh my word ... a perfectly reasonable off-stump angled delivery, pretty innocuous if truth be told, but it did little enough not to bounce over the top as the master momentarily muddled his calculations. Would have crashed into middle and leg, two-thirds up. And well, crikey. England have a golden opportunity now!;Steven Smith lbw b Woakes 80 (261m 145b 9x4 1x6) SR: 55.17;
60.6;?;Leach to Siddle, no run defended once again, tidy over to the tailender;

59.4;?;Sam Curran to Siddle, no run beaten by one that angled in and straightened a touch off the seam. Just past the edge as he defended from the crease;

59.2;?;Sam Curran to Siddle, no run 82mph, back of a length, wide of off, he's happy to leave;
59.1;1;Sam Curran to Smith, 1 run swinging into leg stump, he clips this nicely wide of fine leg but timed it too well to get two. Jofra raced in and threw a rocket back to Bairstow;

58.2;2;Leach to Smith, 2 runs flatter and shorter, he's back and exposing off stump to cu through cover, they take on the deep sweeper for two, Siddle is stretching at the non striker's but getting there;
58.1;?;Leach to Smith, no run drifting in, 53mph, he works this off the front foot to midwicket;
57.6;?;Sam Curran to Siddle, no run another appeal for LBW but again it's doing too much and swinging down leg;
57.5;?;Sam Curran to Siddle, no run angled across, 78mph, going the other way, he covers it through and defends it well enough;
57.4;?;Sam Curran to Siddle, no run full and swinging into the pads but an appeal is in hope rather than genuine optimism. Swinging too far;

57.2;?;Sam Curran to Siddle, no run 81mph, good length, shaping in, on off, he defends off the inside half of the bat to forward square;

56.4;?;Archer to Smith, no run 87mph, bouncer, a good one, outside off, he has to lean back and sway inside the line and drop his hands;
56.3;?;Archer to Smith, no run good length, 87mph, wide of off he flashes and misses trying to square drive off the back foot;
56.2;1b;Archer to Siddle, 1 bye 85mph, full and swinging down leg, Bairstow can't glove it cleanly and they get a bye as it bounces away;

53.6;4;Sam Curran to Siddle, FOUR runs low full toss, attempted yorker outside off, he opened the face and ran it through the vacant gully for four! Crowd got excited but it was too full and off target;
53.5;W;Sam Curran to Cummins, OUT Plumb LBW! Curran on a hat-trick! Cummins reviews. If he hasn't hit it, he is plumb. Full swinging down the line, hit on the shin. No bat. Ball tracking has it smashing middle and leg halfway up;Pat Cummins lbw b Curran 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
53.4;W;Sam Curran to Paine, OUT caught behind! Way too good. 82mph full, hinting to shape in again, but again it pitches and goes with the angle, he got sucked into the drive, gets a thin edge and Bairstow takes a simple catch;Tim Paine c ?Bairstow b Curran 1 (24m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 6.66;

51.2;?;Sam Curran to Paine, no run back of a length, on off, he defends from the crease with the full face;
51.1;?;Sam Curran to Paine, no run huge LBW shout given not out. Swinging down leg. Classic left arm inswinger to a right hander, he fell over, it swung into the front pad but was swinging down leg;
50.6;?;Archer to Smith, no run another good bumper, over off stump, he drops the knees and sways inside the line;
50.6;5w;Archer to Smith, 5 wide bouncer down the leg side and it takes off! Too high for Bairstow and it's called wides as it runs to the boundary;
50.5;?;Archer to Smith, no run good bouncer, 89mph, he ducks under it well enough;
50.4;?;Archer to Smith, no run back of a length, off stump, he's back and defending;

50.1;?;Archer to Paine, no run good length, wide of off, he leaves this alone;
49.6;?;Sam Curran to Smith, no run dropped by Root at first slip! Wow! Short and wide, extra bounce, he tried to upper cut, gets a thick edge, it goes high to Root's right, Stokes sticks left arm up and it might have put Root off at first, he gets two hands two it but can't haul it in!;
49.5;?;Sam Curran to Smith, no run good length, 79mph, wide of off, tempting but Smtih doesn't get tempted;
49.4;?;Sam Curran to Smith, no run 79mph, short attempted bouncer but it ballooned off the surface wide of off;

48.5;?;Archer to Paine, no run huge appeal for LBW, not out is the call. Sliding down. No review. He shuffled back and across to a full ball fired in but might have got a tickle on it. It looked leg side anyway;
48.4;W;Archer to Marsh, OUT caught at fine leg! A huge error from Marsh. It was short into the ribs, he played a pull shot but it wasn't awkward or hurried, he just helped it on it's way but got a top edge and it carried straight to Leach at fine leg. He did not have to move! Marsh will be kicking himself. Archer has four of five;Mitchell Marsh c Leach b Archer 17 (51m 44b 2x4 0x6) SR: 38.63;

44.5;1;Archer to Smith, 1 run pulls in the air but it falls safe well short of deep square. He checked the shot. Awkward stroke. Not advisable against Archer's bounce;

44.3;?;Archer to Smith, no run short ball angled down the leg side;
44.2;?;Archer to Smith, no run bouncer again and Smith half ducks half pulls at it? Odd shot as it flies over his head;

43.5;4;Broad to Marsh, FOUR runs short and wide, that's loose from Broad. Marsh was just starting to feel the pressure with a complex field, lacking a point to encourage the drive. But that was a freebie;
43.4;?;Broad to Marsh, no run good delivery, tail into the front pad, full once more, and just about squeezed away off an inside edge;
43.3;?;Broad to Marsh, no run tight lines from just back of a length, fenced off the back foot to the on-side;
43.2;?;Broad to Marsh, no run on the legs, nudged firmly to midwicket;
43.1;?;Broad to Marsh, no run driven, but with no intent, a scuffed under-edge flaps into the leg side, as Broad aims full and fuller again;
42.6;?;Sam Curran to Smith, no run outside off, through to the keeper;
42.5;1;Sam Curran to Marsh, 1 run nudged off the legs once more;
42.4;?;Sam Curran to Marsh, no run over the wicket now, full once more, punched back to the bowler in his followthrough;
42.3;?;Sam Curran to Marsh, no run bottom-handed thump to mid-off, getting right underneath the full length;
42.2;1;Sam Curran to Smith, 1 run there's that saunter across the stumps again, picking off the angle into the stumps and helping it round the corner;
42.1;4;Sam Curran to Smith, FOUR runs crashed through the covers! Curran changes the angle to come round the wicket, but that's right in his arc, a thumping bottom-handed biff!;
41.6;?;Broad to Marsh, no run defensive prod into the off side. All very regulation from Broad in that over;
41.5;?;Broad to Marsh, no run full length, lovely upright seam, inviting the drive, punched straight into the hands of silly mid-off;
41.4;?;Broad to Marsh, no run back of a length, leaping past a loose chop into the off side. Flighty from Marsh;
41.3;?;Broad to Marsh, no run sliding past the leg stump;
41.2;?;Broad to Marsh, no run outside off, tight lines, good carry, solid leave;
41.1;?;Broad to Marsh, no run full length, tailing in, pressed into the covers;
40.6;2;Sam Curran to Smith, 2 runs twinkle-toed hop across the crease, so calmly flicked off the pads, and the weight of the shot is perfect to allow them to rush back for two, It's relentless!;
40.5;?;Sam Curran to Smith, no run on the back foot, blocked to the on-side with a hop across the crease;
40.4;3;Sam Curran to Marsh, 3 runs squeezed out through backward point, Burns gives chase to intercept;
40.3;?;Sam Curran to Marsh, no run very full, just outside off, Marsh is beaten with a bit of a flaccid stab, very flat-footed;
40.2;?;Sam Curran to Marsh, no run compact drive, meeting a touch of width with an open face, but extra cover is on hand to gather;
40.1;?;Sam Curran to Marsh, no run full face of the bat, driven into the covers, but straight to the man;
39.6;?;Leach to Smith, no run outside off, pressed to point;
39.5;6;Leach to Smith, SIX runs Smith's tenth consecutive Ashes fifty! And it comes up in style, a gallop down the track, not quite to the pitch, but he committed his hands to the task and launched a dismissive thwack high over long-on!;
39.4;?;Leach to Smith, no run soft-handed defence into the covers;
39.3;?;Leach to Smith, no run drawn forward once again with a very full face;
39.2;?;Leach to Smith, no run a hint of pop from just back of a length. Smith stretches to meet the pitch and gets a little surprise as he does so;
39.1;2;Leach to Smith, 2 runs round the wicket, outside off, flogged square, out through deep point where Archer takes a tumble to gather;
38.6;2;Sam Curran to Marsh, 2 runs chiselled off the toes to deep backward square;
38.5;2;Sam Curran to Marsh, 2 runs clipped with intent, on the up through the leg side, Curran isn't finding quite the right line all of a sudden;
38.4;?;Sam Curran to Marsh, no run wicket-to-wicket line, bending back towards off stump. Marsh kneels in a defensive posture to press the ball back to the bowler;
38.3;1;Sam Curran to Smith, 1 run outside leg this time, easy pickings for a clip to backward square;
38.2;?;Sam Curran to Smith, no run swinging onto the legs, Smith gives it a clobbering with oodles of bottom hand, but a strong leg-side ring is in place to cut that off;
38.1;?;Sam Curran to Smith, no run curling back towards the off stump, chopped out to the covers as Smith closes up in his stance;
37.6;?;Leach to Marsh, no run soft-handed edge - well, relatively soft-handed at any rate - as Marsh steers an off-stump line into the cordon;
37.5;?;Leach to Marsh, no run forward and blocked back down the track;
37.4;?;Leach to Marsh, no run punched to mid-on with intent but little timing;
37.3;?;Leach to Marsh, no run thumps the pad and my word that is tight! Marsh played for non-existent spin and so looked all at sea as the ball clobbered him. It needed to turn to take the stumps though. Erasmus is unmoved;
37.2;?;Leach to Marsh, no run leaning forward to cover all bases;
37.1;1;Leach to Smith, 1 run looped into the toes and Smith clips another easy single to the on-side;
36.6;?;Sam Curran to Marsh, no run back of a length, blocked on the back foot straight back down the line. It's a wicket maiden and a hard-earned one too;
36.5;?;Sam Curran to Marsh, no run width and outswing, Marsh opens his face and stabs a nondescript chop into the cordon;
36.4;W;Sam Curran to Wade, OUT huge appeal, a lot of pondering for Dharmasena, and up goes the finger! Superb bowling from Curran, irrespective of the upshot as Wade reviews, late swing on a full length, bending into Wade's pad on a leg-stump line. He was a long way back, was it doing too much? No, it's clipping leg! Due reward for a spell in which he has kept all the Aussies honest, not least the man who still eludes his grasp... But England's 294 is looking healthier now...;Matthew Wade lbw b Curran 19 (39m 31b 2x4 0x6) SR: 61.29;
36.3;?;Sam Curran to Wade, no run full-faced defence, Curran keeping the ball wobbling as Wade stays watchful;
36.2;?;Sam Curran to Wade, no run fired down the leg side, Curran asking the ball to do too much on that occasion;
36.1;?;Sam Curran to Wade, no run squared up in defence, a hint of late shape away from the left-hander, as the ball squirts out to gully;
35.6;1;Leach to Wade, 1 run scuffed up to mid-on, Wade almost yorks himself in his eagerness to get to the pitch, but does the needful in the end;
35.5;?;Leach to Wade, no run watchful in defence, less bite on this one;
35.4;?;Leach to Wade, no run just out of Buttler's reach at short leg! Turn out of the footmarks, rips behind square... was there bat, not sure... but definitely turn;
35.3;1;Leach to Smith, 1 run clipped to midwicket with half a stride out of the crease;
35.2;1;Leach to Wade, 1 run Wade advances to the pitch this time, having decided that there's not a huge amount of turn. Clipped to mid-on for the single;
35.1;?;Leach to Wade, no run outside off, tapped to the off-side from deep in the crease, a bit of a sighter for the batsman;
34.6;?;Woakes to Smith, no run right back and across to blot out the full length. Woakes isn't offering a great deal to England today;
34.5;1;Woakes to Wade, 1 run worked off the legs;
34.4;?;Woakes to Wade, no run pushed onto the back foot, blocked into the off side;
34.3;?;Woakes to Wade, no run tailing into the pads, flicked to the leg side;
34.2;4;Woakes to Wade, FOUR runs back of a length, just enough width for Wade to free his arms, with a thumping upper-cut through the covers. Lovely strike;
34.1;1;Woakes to Smith, 1 run outside off, across comes Smith to tuck this off his hip in that time-honoured fashion;
33.6;?;Sam Curran to Wade, no run wide line, through to the keeper;
33.5;?;Sam Curran to Wade, no run leaning out of the crease, meeting the full length with an angled bat;
33.4;?;Sam Curran to Wade, no run punched on the up to the leg side;
33.3;?;Sam Curran to Wade, no run defended off the back foot;
33.2;?;Sam Curran to Wade, no run outside off, shaping away as Wade leaves alone. Better line, forcing Wade to make a decision;
33.1;2;Sam Curran to Wade, 2 runs on the legs, no swing this time, and the ball shapes right into Wade's arc as a leg-stump half-volley;
32.6;4;Woakes to Smith, FOUR runs sumptuous! Full-length, right in Smith's slot with his weight back in the crease, and those booming hands swing through the line, for a clean blow through long-on;
32.5;?;Woakes to Smith, no run squared up to defend into the off-side, body right behind the line of the ball;
32.4;3;Woakes to Wade, 3 runs speared into the pads, and pushed firmly through midwicket, a long chase to haul that back in;
32.3;?;Woakes to Wade, no run big appeal! Not sure it came back quite enough, but Root is going to review all the same. It was angled across the left-hander and jagged in off the seam, but this looks high and off-sided to me... yep, and umpire's call on impact too. And a big fat inside-edge too, not that the umpire's noticed. Not England's cleverest review of the series. One from the Paine school of reviewing, in fact;
32.2;?;Woakes to Wade, no run Wade strides to the pitch of the ball outside off, then leaves alone on the angle;
32.1;?;Woakes to Wade, no run wide of off stump, shaping across the left-hander, no stroke offered;
