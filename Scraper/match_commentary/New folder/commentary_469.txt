Data
Successive five-wicket hauls for Pattinson, New Zealand have been bundled out for 150. The sun is hiding behind the clouds again, Phil Hughes is under pressure. New Zealand have a chance to fight back. But they could have done with a better batting performance. The conditions were tough to bat in, but they certainly merited a score more than 150. McCullum and Williamson, Brownlie and Bracewell, Brownlie and Southee showed batsmen could fight it out, but Australia's seamers struck at the right times once these partnerships had taken root to press on the advantage they had gained after an early burst of wickets in the first session. Join us in a bit for the Australian response.
Rob: "@ Mark and Alan - Agree with both your comments. We don't play enough test cricket and the dynamic of batting is changing world-wide - but I get the feeling our batsmen could not go through an innings NOT playing their favourite shot. That is what I believe they need to practice in order to gain mental control over themselves. Granted, not easy to do out in the middle against world class bowlers (as I sit on the couch criticising!)."
Ed: "The NZ batsmen should be forced to watch every minute of Alistair Cook's innings against the Aussies in the Ashes. There hasn't bee a better example of application and patience from a young man in Test Cricket in recent years, the Aussies just didn't have an answer."
Errol Erskine: "WI and NZ both have small pools to choose their cricketers from yet people complains that they are not good enough. The good part was that even with such a small pool WI was on top for years."
Dale: "@Matt that is the beauty of test cricket though. The struggle between batsmen and bowler as the bowler tries to limit the runs and attack the impatience of the batsmen luring him into playing a bad shot. Not everyone can be Adam Gilchrist or Matt Hayden in test cricket."
Matt J: "At 6/60 we probably would have taken 150. Dean Brownlie looks the goods - I think quite a few people would be in favour of slotting him up to #5 for the time being. #3 is a concern. Stick Williamson back to #6 where he scored his debut hundred as he's still a bit wet under the ears! What do we think?"

Landed on a good length outside off stump and nipped back in sharply, Taylor didn't read it well, opted to leave and was struck on the pads, the umpire gave it out immediately once the appeal was made but Taylor wasn't convinced. Called for a review, thinking it may have gone over the stumps but ball-tracking shows the ball would have taken off the bails. It's the umpire's call, and he upholds the decision.

2.6;W;Pattinson to Ryder, OUT appeal for lbw, Clarke has called for a review, swung in and rapped Ryder on the pads near leg stump, the bat made contact with the pad as Ryder was trying to close the face on that fullish delivery. Hot Spot left the mark but to me it seems it was the bat making contact with the pad and not the inside edge but it's what the umpire thinks that counts. Ball-tracking shows the impact was in line with the stumps and the ball would have gone on to hit leg stump. Nigel Llong reverses his decision, it's out and Ryder has to walk back.;Jesse Ryder lbw b Pattinson 0 (10m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

1.5;?;Siddle to Ryder, no run angles this one away from the batsman, a bit more width on this one and Ryder just leaves it alone;

0.6;4lb;Pattinson to McCullum, 4 leg byes struck him hard on the shoulders as McCullum was trying to evade that, banged in short on leg stump and McCullum tried to get out of the way, the deflection off the shoulder took it to the fine-leg boundary;

0.1;?;Pattinson to McCullum, no run nipped back in, good bounce for Pattinson and it raps McCullum on the thighs as he surprisingly lets that go, was heading for his thigh and he decided not to play at it;

Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill are making their way out. Slightly overcast out there. What a lovely ground. Pattinson, James not Darren, will kick things off for Australia. McCullum will take strike. Three slips and a gully. There's also a short leg
Matt joins in from New Zealand: "I must say, I am genuinely excited as an NZ supporter. Yes, I know this may be stating the obvious, but if Mccullum can stick around for a couple of sessions, he WILL have a big hundred. And I'm sure he'll have taken some inspiration from his slightly more successful slam bam mate Virender Sehwag - it is possible to get a huge score without playing stupid shots - a la the first test. Good luck Brendon Mccullum and the rest of the team - I'll be happy if the game is still on on Tuesday..."
Wilko: "The only thing missing from that picture is cows and sheep who should be grazing!"
Dr.Jones: "There once was a legend, Vettori,
whose absence made NZ go awry.
He was vision impaired,
but he always dared,
and now NZ cries for he." Wearing glasses doesn't mean he has an "impaired" vision, but we'll let that go for rhyming purposes
Here's a bit more on Vettori from Brydon Coverdale, our man at the ground: "Vettori arrived at the ground with hamstring tightness and aggravated it during the warm-up, to the point where he felt he couldn't play. It's too early yet to know the extent of the injury". It's his left hamstring.
Tony: "I'm not surprised Vettori was overlooked from 1882 to 1986. Back then he was still fine tuning his arm ball."
Simon: "The wicket looks like something I played on back in my days of Under 16's for Randwick. Unbelievably Green."
Smudgeon: "Ah, test cricket back in Tassie. Nice. The Kiwis might feel a little more at home here, but I don't think they should expect an easy run from the young'uns in the Aussie camp." They'd be wise not to expect an easy run, did you look at the pitch?
I like Tommy J's sense of humour: "Statsguru has put my mind at ease. NZ have won only 31% of their Tests with Vettori in the side. From 1982 - 1986 (when Vettori was constantly overlooked by ageist selectors) we won 38% of our Tests. So we might be better off!"
Wonder why I'd been thinking of Darren Pattinson. Thanks for pointing it out.
Hayden: "After discussing how Vettori is not playing, Ross Taylor looks so disappointed that he lost the toss (thus having to bat). It almost as if he is going to cry." Just have a look at the track here: this picture was taken yesterday.
Toss: Australia have won the toss and decided to field. Not surprising, given the greenish shade on the pitch. Australia are fielding an unchanged side. Big blow to New Zealand. Daniel Vettori isn't playing, he's been replaced by left-arm seamer Trent Boult, who'll be making his international debut. It appears Vettori has a muscle strain, his absence weakens New Zealand significantly. Will confirm the exact nature of the injury as we have more details.
Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the second Test between Australia and New Zealand being played in Hobart. Australia lost several players to injury ahead of the first test at the Gabba but that didn't stop them from thumping their neighbours by nine wickets, thanks to an impressive debut for James Pattinson preceded by a slightly fortuitous century from Michael Clarke. Ross Taylor has promised a more determined and disciplined effort from his batsmen this time around, so let's see how his team shapes up. We're just minutes away from the toss, but do read Dan Brettig's preview to this game in the meantime.
 Innings Start
Boult finishes with three wickets, Martin picked up three as well, and New Zealand have gained a handy 14-run lead. Not many would have backed them to finish the first innings as the team in front, and it's up to them now to ensure they stay there. The ball's still moving around, so the Australian bowlers will sense a chance. How will New Zealand's batsmen fare the second time around? The sun is out, so the track may ease up but all that remains to be seen. Back in five minutes.
50.6;W;Boult to Starc, OUT appeal for lbw turned down by Asad Rauf and Taylor calls for a review, lands on a good length on middle and was angling towards leg, no impact with the bat, was heading towards leg stump, a good part of the ball as the ball-tracking shows and Asad Rauf will have to reverse his decision.

3.20pm An encouraging update - Play will resume at 3.30pm.
The players took an early tea, after the innings ended.
3.15pm An update from our man at the ground, Brydon Coverdale: The rain seems to have stopped, though the covers are still on. The rope is heading around the outfield to try to help the drainage. And the lights are on, so light may become an issue as well.
3.05pm local time It's raining in Hobart, folks. Not heavily but the covers are on, bad news.
 Innings Start
Australia will back themselves to chase this, the conditions are still favourable for fast bowling but not as much as on the first two days. However, the new ball will be a threat and the top order needs to step up. Siddle was the pick of the bowlers, and Pattinson did superbly as well, removing Taylor and Brownlie in quick time. New Zealand will be disappointed Southee and Bracewell didn't do more, and given their position at the start of the day where they were set for a target in excess of 300, they've fallen significantly short. Boult's contribution was important in stretching the lead to 240. Two more sessions to go, this has been an exciting Test and hope the chase is as closely-fought as the first-innings was. Join us in about 30 minutes.

 Innings Start
Lyon was distraught, rewind to the reactions after Edgbaston 2005 and this was so much similar, was on his knees wondering what happened. He'd played so well until that point, supporting his senior partner. But New Zealand were just a wicket away, and Bracewell delivered the finishing blow. Spare a thought for Warner, who watched his partners captitulate one after another in a matter of minutes after the lunch break. He'd guided his team to a position of advantage with a naturally aggressive innings, but saw the innings fall apart helplessly. In the company of Lyon, he tried as hard as he could, piercing the spread-out fields, going airborne, switching to T20 mode on occasion, but there was only so much he could do. With the ball nipping about, New Zealand's bowlers were always in with a chance.
Warner: "It's a disappointment we didn't win. I wasn't quite sure, I was always back Nathan's instincts. He batted very well there. We backed ourselves but we didn't get across the line. We've batted well together this year."
Southee: "That was too close to comfort. A nail-biting finish. It's the first time we've done that since some of us have been alive. It was a great innings right through from Warner. We've got a great fielding side, we believe in our fielders, and we did a great job in the slips."
Stay tuned, we'll get the presentation details in a bit.
David Warner has been voted Man of the Match: "Disappointing to get so close and not finishing it off. Credit to New Zealand. There was swing there and variable bounce, fantastic effort from him and other bowlers. . Nathan would be disappointed but at the end of the day, it's cricket, and we'll learn from it."
James Pattinson is Man of the Series: "You want to win 2-0 but Doug Bracewell bowled very all. Cricket's a funny game and things chance pretty quickly. I've done a lot of work with craig McDermott, and the line was to pitch the ball up."
Ross Taylor: "It was a great turnaround from Brisbane. Special note to Warner, he played outstandingly well. Having four seamers helped us out there. Losing Daniel on the morning of the Test was tough, but the others stepped up. It's always enjoyable captaining the country and beating Australia. I'm proud of the team."
Michael Clarke: "Disappointed, no doubt. We were pretty inconsistent throughout this Test. Credit to Warner and Lyon. The ball swung all day and we needed a couple more partnerships. Right now, it's about being with the team and working on the pros and the cons. We want to be 100% ready for the Test against India. Warner is an amazing talent, he's made the most of his chance in one-dayers and T20 and he's shown that in Tests today as well."
Australia retain the Trans-Tasman trophy because they had won it the previous time.
Lot's of feedback about why the Man of the Match was Warner and not Bracewell, who picked up nine wickets, but there was voting system in place. An incredible Test match that was riveting throughout. We'll again say it's a pity that the Test series lasted just two games, but some of the results over the last few months have been an excellent endorsement for the five-day version. Let's hope India's tour of Australia continues that trend. Long live Test cricket. Many thanks for tuning in and sending us your feedback. It was a pleasure bringing you the coverage for this series. Before you sign off, please don't forget to read Daniel Brettig's report for the day's play. There'll be more stories coming through the day from our man at the ground, Brydon Coverdale. That's all from us. Thanks again, and see you soon.
63.4;W;Bracewell to Lyon, OUT Bracewell seals it for New Zealand! Got that to nip back in from outside off, closed the face on that one but it beat him through the gate, what a Test match but fittingly, it was Bracewell who finished it off, securing his team's first win over Australia since March 1993. It's their first Test win in Australia since 1985;Nathan Lyon b Bracewell 9 (43m 27b 1x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;

62.4;1;Southee to Warner, 1 run pitched up outside off, chips that wide of extra cover, lands just short of the fielder there as he dives to his right, was in the air for a bit;
62.3;1;Southee to Lyon, 1 run more runs, opens the face and guides that past point for a single;
62.2;4;Southee to Lyon, FOUR runs Lyon, Lyon, pulls off a text-book drive through midwicket, pitched on middle and he cracks that through midwicket for a boundary, just 11 more needed now;

60.3;?;Southee to Lyon, no run yorker length and Lyon tried to turn the face on that one, big appeal and it's given but did he nick it? Llong gave it out, and the batsman's called for a review. Replays show the ball makes contact with the back leg. Did it hit leg? Was it missing it? Will it be the umpire's call? All down to ball-tracking now. Incredible tension here, ball-tracking shows the ball pitched outside leg, only just. The match will go on. Hit the back leg. It did not swing back in enough either, Llong has to reverse his decision. Eagle-eye showed that it pitched outside leg.
