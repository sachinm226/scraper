Data
End of innings Good knock from Anderson there, and that's England's innings. They were looking for 450+ and though they'll be disappointed, 425 is still a decent score. More importantly, the ball is moving considerably this morning and their bowlers - Onions and Anderson in particular - have an opportunity to do the same to Australia's top-order. Brydon Coverdale will guide you through the opening salvoes in about ten minutes. In the meantime, have a read of this, the future of USA cricket.
101.4;W;Johnson to Anderson, OUT got him this time! Got big on him and square cut it low to gully who took a fine catch;James Anderson c Hussey b Johnson 29 (47m 25b 5x4 0x6) SR: 116;
101.3;4;Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs what a shot! Anderson is playing quite brilliantly here, driving on the up and opening the face. Deep backward point hasn't a hope. Class from Anderson;
101.2;1;Johnson to Onions, 1 run slashed hard - catch that! But no, it flies short of third man;
101.1;1;Johnson to Anderson, 1 run steps to leg and flicks this behind square. Misfield from fine leg but they don't think about two;
100.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run outside off, he shuffles back to defend;
100.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run fuller and Onions gets in line, defending it solidly this time;
100.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run these are too good for Onions. He plays and misses to another outswinger;
100.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run on that's unfairly close, it really is! An inch, no more, from taking Onions' outside edge;
100.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run beaten outside off - moved away just enough to beat the shaky technique of Onions;
100.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run defended out to cover, defended very solidly;
99.6;4;Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs four more - and that's a very clever shot indeed. Short, wide - awful, frankly, from Johnson - and uppercut over backward point for four more;
99.5;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run again short, targetting his chest and Anderson is back and defending;
99.4;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run back of a length and again nicely defended by a steely eyed Anderson, defending on the back foot and down by his toes. Boycott will be proud;
99.3;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run short of a length and hurries into the rib-cage area of Anderson who tucks it to leg;
99.2;4;Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs Johnson tries to correct his line but it's much too straight, this time, and it's down the leg side for four more!;
99.1;4;Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs take that. Superb stroke, but another poor delivery from Johnson - just too full and much, much too wide. Anderson steps back, rocks back, and flangs it through extra cover;
98.6;2;Hilfenhaus to Onions, 2 runs lifts this over extra cover! Onions on fire here (sorry);
98.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run shorter delivery and Onions is showing a propensity for the pull - immense relish (sorry) for pulling Hilfenhaus with one-legged jollity;
98.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run ooh, full and swinging away from Onions who drives and misses;
98.3;1;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 1 run Anderson pushed out to the off side;
98.2;2;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 2 runs nudged off his hip;
98.1;1;Hilfenhaus to Onions, 1 run Onions! He's gone for a highly ambitious Viv Richards-esque pull on the front foot, but finds mid-on - who flings in a throw but it's wide! More runs for England;
97.6;4;Johnson to Anderson, FOUR runs pressure on Johnson! Superb back-foot drive, elegantly driven past point to send a packed Lord's crowd into delirium. Nothing like a tailender boshing quick runs;
97.5;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run fuller delivery, nicely bowled, but nicely defended too - pushed out quite crisply to the off side;
97.4;1;Johnson to Onions, 1 run guided out to the off side;
97.3;?;Johnson to Onions, no run down the leg side;
97.2;1;Johnson to Anderson, 1 run short of a length and guided out to the off side. Neatly played;
97.1;1;Johnson to Onions, 1 run little nudge to midwicket and they steal a single. Johnson's sick as a parrot - can't believe they stole a single;
96.6;1;Hilfenhaus to Onions, 1 run full enough to drive, so he does drive and gets a single out to McDonald at deep extra cover;
96.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run so close! Terrific line from Hilfenhaus - the pick of Australia's bowlers in the series thus far, comfortably - and Onions again rather cluelessly flapped and missed;
96.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run ah, well bowled - almost too much movement for Hilfenhaus here, as the ball bent away markedly on the right-hander who, with tail-end jollity, tried to fling it over the slips and missed;
96.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run short, wide and pushed out to the off side;
96.2;4;Hilfenhaus to Onions, FOUR runs bosh! Great stroke from Onions, slapping this past point off the back foot - almost an orthodox square cut, save for the fact he's a tail-ender. Still - an encouraging and crowd-cheering blow;
96.1;3;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, 3 runs good delivery - good thinking, at least - angling this across the left-hander but Anderson's played it nicely, guiding it past point for a single;
95.6;?;Siddle to Onions, no run a little too short and left alone;
95.5;?;Siddle to Onions, no run left alone outside off;
95.4;4;Siddle to Onions, FOUR runs bosh! Upper cut over gully and point for four. Super smash, that;
95.4;1nb;Siddle to Onions, (no ball) well he might be ill, but Siddle's bowled a beauty here that crashes into Onions' helmet;

95.2;?;Siddle to Onions, no run shorter delivery that he ducks beneath;
95.1;?;Siddle to Onions, no run sharp, shortish delivery to Onions who, on the back foot, defends it nervously, getting a thick inside edge to his pads;
94.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run an extravagant flay out to the off side;
94.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run nasty, horrid short ball - very, very well bowled indeed - but Anderson plays this well, jumping up and getting his hands high to fend the ball down;
94.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run;
94.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;

93.5;?;Siddle to Onions, no run short, edged - or angled - to third slip;
93.4;?;Siddle to Onions, no run a short stray down the leg side - superb snaffle by Haddin diving and leaping to his left;
93.3;1;Siddle to Anderson, 1 run clunked out to the off side - oh blimey, trouble here! Throw comes in but it's wide. That would've been curtains;
93.2;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run angled across him and beats the outside edge! Australia are all over England like a particularly violent rash;
93.1;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run short and climbs into Anderson who is nervously defending on the tips of his toes;

92.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run short of a length and whipped to leg but he can't time it;

92.1;4;Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs on his legs, pulled fine for four. Well played. Runs are suddenly at an absolute premium and much rests on Broad;
91.6;?;Siddle to Anderson, no run snorter! An absolute cracker from Siddle which flew off a length past Broad's outside edge;
91.5;W;Siddle to Swann, OUT edged to Ponting at second slip! Brilliant from Siddle, pitching it short and angling it up the hill and at chest height to Swann who angles it straight to slip;Graeme Swann c Ponting b Siddle 4 (6m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
91.4;?;Siddle to Swann, no run predictably short, though a little stiff and slow in pace;

91.1;?;Siddle to Broad, no run down the leg side, off his hip and bowler and wicketkeeper roar a hopeful appeal.;
90.6;4;Hilfenhaus to Swann, FOUR runs juicy. On his legs and beautifully clipped for four, though he will need to be wary of the one which straightens on him. Too full from Hilfenhaus though;
90.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run too wide and left alone;
90.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run nice, encouraging shape away from the right-handed Swann who leaves it alone;
90.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Swann, no run straighter delivery on the middle stump;
90.2;W;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, OUT GOT HIM! Strauss leaves one which bends back - a disastrous leave from the England captain and his off stump is pegged back. What a start for Australia!;Andrew Strauss b Hilfenhaus 161 (370m 268b 22x4 0x6) SR: 60.07;
90.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run starts with a really stiff loosener, wide of the off stump;

89.3;?;Johnson to Broad, no run good line this time, no swing though, and Broad gets in behind it to defend;

82.3;W;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, OUT gone! The old ball works out for Hilfenhaus. A great outswinger takes the edge of Flintoff's bat and Ponting and second slip snaffles the opportunity;Andrew Flintoff c Ponting b Hilfenhaus 4 (16m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40;

64.1;?;North to Strauss, no run wide of the off stump, spinning away from Strauss who ignores it;
63.6;4;Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs driven hard back to Siddle, through his hands, through his legs for four. That was a real toe-crusher - from Pietersen, not Siddle - and can barely be described a chance, but nevertheless I'm still going to have to say it: dropped;
63.5;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run slightly tighter line and a better length;
63.4;4;Siddle to Pietersen, FOUR runs oh take that. Pietersen at his best - a front-foot cover-driven slap for four. Bosh;
63.3;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run left alone outside off;
63.2;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run driven to mid-on;
63.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run very full and a little stiff, driven to mid-on;
62.6;?;North to Strauss, no run nice ball - floating it up high and forcing Strauss to reach for it;
62.5;1;North to Pietersen, 1 run nurdled off his toes;
62.4;1;North to Strauss, 1 run short and clunked off the back foot;
62.3;?;North to Strauss, no run good line - or good areas, as Monty might say - which spits away from Strauss;
62.2;?;North to Strauss, no run tighter line. Strauss smothers it like an experienced murderer;
62.1;?;North to Strauss, no run outside off and defended;
61.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run defended to cover;
61.5;3;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, 3 runs and there's the hundred for Strauss! He cuts it away behind point, McDonald on the boundary stops the four but three is enough and what a super innings it's been;
61.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run left alone outside off;
61.3;1;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, 1 run clipped away to square leg and Pietersen will be happy to get off strike there;
61.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run oh, another close one! He's tried to hook this one and it's flown off the top edge, lobs up behind square, Haddin can't quite get there in time;
61.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run oh, KP almost a brain-freeze there! He's chopped it into the ground and as it bounces up he puts his hand out as if to grab it, then rethinks and leaves it, then thinks about handling it again, then remembers himself again and it doesn't roll back onto his stumps.;
60.6;?;North to Strauss, no run and driven to mid-off;
60.5;?;North to Strauss, no run well, not with this ball, though it was wide outside off, his cut doesn't beat point;
60.4;1;North to Pietersen, 1 run worked away to square leg;
60.3;?;North to Pietersen, no run drifts onto the pads, it's defended to leg;
60.2;?;North to Pietersen, no run straight-bat defence this time;
60.1;4;North to Pietersen, FOUR runs and Pietersen uses his feet well here, advances to the offspinner and lofts a drive over mid-on, not timed perfectly but it was safe all the same;
59.6;1;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, 1 run a quick single again, driven to mid-on and Strauss wasn't backing up at all, so he had to hustle to get through;
59.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run inside edge onto the pad;
59.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run straighter ball and it's worked to leg;
59.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run drives in the same direction this time but can't beat Katich at mid-off;
59.2;4;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, FOUR runs that's a good punchy off-drive, Pietersen gets to the pitch of it and helped it on its way nicely;
59.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run Pietersen leaves this one close to his off stump but it's not quite deja vu from Cardiff, this one sails over the stumps;
58.6;3;North to Pietersen, 3 runs edge! But it's wide of the sole slip, it was a quicker ball and Pietersen didn't get to it in time, Hilfenhaus chases it down to third man and makes a good sliding save;
58.5;1;North to Strauss, 1 run driven away through cover and there's a man on the boundary;
58.4;?;North to Strauss, no run flighted outside off, Strauss leaves it, biding his time to reach his hundred;
58.3;?;North to Strauss, no run on the back foot, cuts straight to point;
58.2;1;North to Pietersen, 1 run driven down the ground for a single;
58.1;4;North to Pietersen, 4 runs ooh, that was a close one! Pietersen drives to mid-on, where Ponting's quick grab and release could have had Strauss in a bit of trouble at the non-striker's end. But he missed and there's overthrows galore;

A short catching mid-off in place now
 Innings Start
So, yes, they're going to have another bat. No great surprise really. Here's Brydon until lunch.
What's Strauss going to do? I think he said he's having a bat, and he's sprinting off, so it looks like that's the case. We'll let you know as soon as possible.
62.6;W;Onions to Siddle, OUT got him! Done. Flashed outside off and Strauss takes the catch;Peter Siddle c Strauss b Onions 35 (65m 47b 5x4 0x6) SR: 74.46;
62.5;?;Onions to Siddle, no run so close! Siddle is stuck in two minds, tries to duck but can't get out of the way, gloving it high, and it loops short of gully;
62.4;1;Onions to Hilfenhaus, 1 run comes forward and angles it past point;
62.3;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run nice outswinger. He plays and misses. Much better length from Onions, drawing him into the stroke;

62.1;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run too wide from Onions;
61.6;1;Broad to Hilfenhaus, 1 run flicked past leg gully;

61.3;?;Broad to Siddle, no run another bumper, defended on the back foot;
61.2;?;Broad to Siddle, no run wide, short, left alone;
61.1;?;Broad to Siddle, no run yep. Wide of the off stump, though Siddle flashed at it and missed;
60.6;4;Onions to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs crunched off the back foot - what a shot that is! Sublime from the No. 11;
60.5;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run wider of the crease, he flashes and misses;
60.4;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run flashed outside off and he misses;
60.3;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run;

59.6;?;Broad to Siddle, no run a bouncer down the leg side;
59.5;?;Broad to Siddle, no run quick bouncer. But yes, another bouncer;
59.4;?;Broad to Siddle, no run glided out to the off side;
59.3;4;Broad to Siddle, FOUR runs four more - Australia are racing here! Another idiotic short delivery and Siddle hooks it - yes, like a tailender, and not in total control, but he's chancing his arm as well he should;
59.2;?;Broad to Siddle, no run reasonable bouncer, sways out of the way;
59.1;4;Broad to Siddle, FOUR runs four more! A lucky, flashy edge flies down to third man and Australia reach 200, much to the joy of the yellow-t-shirt brigade in amongst the many England fans;
58.6;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run again, too wide, and that completes a successful over for Onions;
58.5;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run comfortably left alone outside off;
58.4;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run short and wide outside off;
58.3;W;Onions to Hauritz, OUT got him! Short of a length outside off, Hauritz goes back and tries to force it off the back foot but can only edge to Collingwood who holds a safe catch at third slip;Nathan Hauritz c Collingwood b Onions 24 (53m 36b 4x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
58.2;?;Onions to Hauritz, no run very full, very wide, he goes for a drive but misses;
58.1;4;Onions to Hauritz, FOUR runs shot! What a beautiful shot, riding the bounce and crisply punching this behind square. Opened the face nicely;
57.6;?;Broad to Siddle, no run flashed out to point;
57.5;2;Broad to Siddle, 2 runs good stuff from Broad! Short, nasty riser that he tries to hook like Greenidge but it comes off a part of his body;
57.4;?;Broad to Siddle, no run straighter delivery but still short and defended;
57.3;?;Broad to Siddle, no run off the back foot, nicely defended out to cover;
57.2;?;Broad to Siddle, no run ooh that's a nasty one. A rare brute from Broad who at last bounces him straight, and Siddle ducks into it and receives a blow on his fingers;
57.1;?;Broad to Siddle, no run fuller and straighter and flicked to leg;
56.6;4;Anderson to Hauritz, FOUR runs four more. Sliced past point nicely - Australia are looking disconcertingly comfortable here;

56.4;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run short of a length, punched again to mid-off;
56.3;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run ooh, good line but well left by Hauritz;
56.2;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run short of a length, he rocks back and punches it out to mid-off;
56.1;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run punched out to the off side;

55.3;?;Broad to Siddle, no run onto the front foot, nudging to leg;

54.6;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run onto the front foot and he defends;
54.5;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run edged and again it falls short of Collingwood at third slip, diving to his right;
54.4;1;Anderson to Hauritz, 1 run punched out to the off side and they steal a single;
54.3;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run swings back in, Hauritz flays it out to cover off the back foot;
54.2;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run edged and dropped, is it? Superb attempt by Collingwood at third slip, and in fact that fell short of him so he saved four. Well done;
54.1;1;Anderson to Siddle, 1 run drifts this down the leg side and they'll get a single to fine leg;
53.6;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run oh dear. Yet another bouncer;
53.5;1;Broad to Siddle, 1 run another short one;
53.4;?;Broad to Siddle, no run short and wide outside off and he sways out of the way;
53.3;2;Broad to Siddle, 2 runs nudged to leg and they'll get two;

53.1;1;Broad to Hauritz, 1 run blocked out to cover;
52.6;4;Anderson to Siddle, FOUR runs on the drive and it's four more - a flashing edge past a diving point! This is not good for England at all;
52.5;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run wide of the crease and spearing into his off stump but, again, it's well defended. Firmly defended out to point;
52.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run short and wide and left alone;
52.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run firmly defended out to cover. They think of a single before opting against it;
52.2;4;Anderson to Siddle, FOUR runs shot - shot! Superb on-drive for four. Have some of that;
52.1;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run good length, Siddle prods forward and pokes this to point;
51.6;2;Broad to Hauritz, 2 runs flicked off his pads and dropped by Cook at short-leg, though that was a seriously tough chance. It was well timed and Cook is standing no more than a metre away;
51.5;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run way, way too wide and short;
51.4;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run and another short ball, at a highly unlikely 91.6mph. Hauritz plays it well;
51.3;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run a bumper. Hauritz ducks;
51.2;4;Broad to Hauritz, FOUR runs on the back foot and four more! Thick outside edge past the slips. Crucial, vital runs for Australia;
51.1;1;Broad to Siddle, 1 run drops this out to the off side and immediately calls a single. Well played. Urgent cricket;
50.6;4;Anderson to Hauritz, FOUR runs nicely played, gliding it past gully for four. Played that very late;
50.5;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run down the leg side. Booming swing;
50.4;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run really good line and length just outside off. Haley defends;
50.3;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run punched out to the off side;
50.2;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run beaten! Excellent delivery holding its line outside off. Good length, too short to drive but he drives and misses;
50.1;1;Anderson to Siddle, 1 run swings in late on the right-hander who flicks it just past short leg;
49.6;1;Broad to Siddle, 1 run touch of bounce, Siddle fends it to leg off his glove, steals the strike - and, indeed, retains it. Well done him;
49.5;?;Broad to Siddle, no run at last Broad makes Siddle play, and he defends with pleasing solidity;
49.4;?;Broad to Siddle, no run a short bumper down the leg side. This is a pointless over so far;
49.3;?;Broad to Siddle, no run the third bouncer in a row and again Siddle ducks. 91mph, apparently. That speedgun is about as reliable as a chocolate fire guard;
49.2;?;Broad to Siddle, no run another bouncer, comfortably ducked beneath;
49.1;?;Broad to Siddle, no run Broad starts with a Bouncer, to which Siddle ducks and smiles;

48.3;3;Anderson to Siddle, 3 runs guided - though perhaps not deliberately - wide of gully and Siddle is off the mark;

48.1;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run outside off and left alone;
47.6;?;Broad to Siddle, no run Siddle could've expected a short one first up, but he gets a fuller ball outside off that he can leave alone;
47.5;W;Broad to Haddin, OUT Broad strikes with another short one! Haddin hooks but doesn't get enough of it and it bobs up to midwicket where Cook takes the catch;Brad Haddin c Cook b Broad 28 (28m 38b 3x4 0x6) SR: 73.68;
47.4;?;Broad to Haddin, no run driven to mid-on this time;
47.3;?;Broad to Haddin, no run angled in and bounces over off stump as Haddin lets it go;
47.2;1;Broad to Hauritz, 1 run on the hips, Hauritz clips it away in the air over square leg, safely short of the man in the deep;
47.1;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run bouncer, Hauritz ducks underneath it;
46.6;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run Haddin gets in behind it to defend;
46.5;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run probing outside off, but Haddin lets it go;

46.3;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run no shot offered outside off;
46.2;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run short ball, wide of off and Hauritz leaves it;
46.1;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run on off stump, he defends this one safely;
45.6;2;Broad to Haddin, 2 runs flicked away off his pads through square leg, it races away quickly but Onions makes good ground to pull off an effective, if not exactly pretty, save;
45.5;W;Broad to Johnson, OUT another one falls for the trap! Broad bangs it in short and Johnson hooks, but he can't keep it down, it skies out to Cook at deep square leg;Mitchell Johnson c Cook b Broad 4 (13m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 36.36;
45.4;?;Broad to Johnson, no run angled across Johnson, who leaves it;
45.3;?;Broad to Johnson, no run no shot offered outside off;
45.2;?;Broad to Johnson, no run bouncer, Johnson thinks about hooking and then changes his mind;
45.1;?;Broad to Johnson, no run bangs it in short, Johnson pushes it down defensively;
44.6;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run nudged away to cover, no real swing there;
44.5;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run very solid in defence this time;
44.4;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run left alone outside off;
44.3;2;Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs another lovely cover-drive but there's a man out in the deep to keep it to two;
44.2;2;Anderson to Haddin, 2 runs pushed through cover and they get a couple of runs;
44.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run probing outside off, Haddin defends with a straight bat;
43.6;?;Broad to Johnson, no run bouncer now, and Johnson ducks;
43.5;4;Broad to Johnson, FOUR runs that's a solid pull from Johnson to get him off the mark. Shortish on off stump, he gets into position quickly and rolls the wrists, good shot.;
43.4;?;Broad to Johnson, no run cramps Johnson up, he nudges it down off his hips;
43.3;1;Broad to Haddin, 1 run angled in again and it's skewed off a thick inside edge;
43.2;?;Broad to Haddin, no run Broad appeals, Doctrove denies him. Angled in to Haddin, it hits him above the knee-roll on the front leg, which was off the ground, so height was an issue as was the angle;
43.1;?;Broad to Haddin, no run Haddin leans into a cover-drive here, can't beat the field;
42.6;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run good ball, pitches on off and moves away a touch, Johnson plays and misses;
42.5;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run angled across Johnson, who leaves it;
42.4;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run left alone to start with;
42.3;W;Anderson to North, OUT gone! North looks to pull but it wasn't short enough and he ran out of room, drags a thick inside edge back onto his stumps.;Marcus North b Anderson 0 (33m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
42.2;?;Anderson to North, no run left alone again, this one straightens but not enough to take the off stump;
42.1;?;Anderson to North, no run angled across North, who lets it go;
41.6;?;Broad to Haddin, no run pushed to mid-off and there's no run;
41.5;?;Broad to Haddin, no run defended to leg this time;
41.4;4;Broad to Haddin, FOUR runs nice shot from Haddin, he's driven that just wide of mid-on, where Anderson dives over the ball and it dribbles away to the boundary for four, not superbly timed but he did enough;
41.3;?;Broad to Haddin, no run driven hard into the ground, it bounces high and Haddin protects his stumps;
41.2;?;Broad to Haddin, no run bunted back down the pitch again;
41.1;?;Broad to Haddin, no run straight ball to start, Haddin defends;
40.6;?;Anderson to North, no run full delivery on the off stump but very well played by North, crunching it hard back past the bowler. This game is alive - it's buzzing like you wouldn't believe;
40.5;?;Anderson to North, no run rare tripe from Anderson, miles wide of the off stump;
40.4;3;Anderson to Haddin, 3 runs flicked to leg;
40.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run swings back again, and Haddin is watchfully jabbing a defensive to leg;
40.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run swings back late on Haddin and that kept horribly low - he did so well to get his bat in front of the stumps! Anderson's bending it markedly, at pace;
40.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run inswinger, bashed back to Anderson. Good length, good pace - Anderson's on the money here;
39.6;?;Flintoff to North, no run North steps back to block it off the back foot, and Flintoff - puce in the face, sweat pouring off him - glares back as though ready to knock his block off;
39.5;?;Flintoff to North, no run massive pace again from Flintoff and he's back, across and defending;
39.4;3;Flintoff to Haddin, 3 runs that hurried him! Even on the back foot, Haddin had to jab down on it late and flick it through midwicket. Timed it well;
39.4;1nb;Flintoff to Haddin, (no ball) jumps back and defends;
39.3;4;Flintoff to Haddin, FOUR runs what a shot! A square-drive of class and flair, playing it behind point. Superb stuff from Haddin. He's such a great player to watch;
39.2;2lb;Flintoff to Haddin, 2 leg byes ooh, fends this off his hip I think. Aggressive, nasty bowling from Flintoff;
39.1;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run he jumps back to defend;
38.6;4b;Anderson to North, 4 byes wide of the off stump and it shoots through a little low on Prior, though he really should've stopped that;
38.5;?;Anderson to North, no run defended on the back foot;
38.4;?;Anderson to North, no run comfortably left alone, though Anderson's generating some serious wheels and bending the ball like Beckham;
38.3;?;Anderson to North, no run well wide of the off stump;
38.2;?;Anderson to North, no run swinging away from the left-hander;
38.1;?;Anderson to North, no run wide of the crease, late swing into his off stump;
37.6;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run left alone outside off to end a seriously fast over;
37.5;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run brilliant! Cuts back into Haddin, the ball gets trapped in the flap of his right pad. Haddin skips away from the fielder nervously with the ball still lodged, worried someone might pluck it and claim a catch, but eventually realises the ball is dead! Good moment; light and temporary relief in the midst of a hurricane of an over;
37.4;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run that has flown through. Left alone outside off and it lifts nastily. Flintoff glares, sweat pouring off his head. What a terrifying sight he is;
37.3;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run shuffles back, gets right in line;
37.2;4;Flintoff to Haddin, FOUR runs he's timed the leather off that! What a superb off-drive from Haddin, standing tall and holding the pose with a terrific, classy shot. This guy is a serious bat;
37.1;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run big shout as Flintoff cuts this back in, but that'll be too high, surely. And yes, it's given not out, but Flintoff's bowling like the wind here - heavy, nasty deliveries;
36.6;?;Anderson to North, no run on the off stump and driven with confidence out to cover;
36.5;3;Anderson to Haddin, 3 runs well defended on the back foot - oh, no, a misfield! Hapless effort from backward point. Bopara the guilty one;
36.4;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run Anderson sends it wide of the off stump and he leaves it well alone;
36.3;W;Anderson to Clarke, OUT he's gone too! Clarke's whipped an inswinger to midwicket - that was definitely a plan and Cook took a good, very low catch;Michael Clarke c Cook b Anderson 1 (21m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 8.33;
36.2;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run that's good from Anderson - a testing off-stump line, bending back into a nervous-looking Clarke;
36.1;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run sharp pace and movement back into the right-hander, who appeals after rattling him very near the crown jewels. Much too high;
35.6;W;Flintoff to Hussey, OUT bowled him! He's bowled him! Hussey's left a straight one! 95.1mph on the off stump, held its line and smashed the top of off;Michael Hussey b Flintoff 51 (127m 91b 8x4 0x6) SR: 56.04;
35.5;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run blocked off the back foot;
35.4;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run defended on the off stump. 93.6mph apparently, but I just can't believe or trust the speedo any longer;
35.3;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run squeezed out off a thick outside edge. Superb stop by a diving Pietersen at point;
35.2;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run good one. Short and straight, zeroing in on his heart;
35.1;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run down the leg side at 92.3mph, though Hussey did have a faint attempt at nudging. A fudging, if you like. Or perhaps not.;
34.6;?;Onions to Clarke, no run left alone outside off and Prior fumbles it as it crept through low on him;
34.5;?;Onions to Clarke, no run left alone outside off, again a little too wide really;
34.4;?;Onions to Clarke, no run well wide;
34.3;1;Onions to Hussey, 1 run another pull, down into the ground;
34.2;?;Onions to Hussey, no run goes on the pull and a huge appeal from Onions as Prior takes the ball. Not out! Looks like it brushed the shirt, or thigh-pad, or something. An excellent decision;
34.1;?;Onions to Hussey, no run steps forward, shouldering arms;
33.6;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;
33.5;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run solid defensive on the back foot. 93.6mph;
33.4;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run too wide, though it bent back slightly in the air. Clarke sways out of the way;
33.4;2nb;Flintoff to Hussey, (no ball) 1 run on his legs, nudged to leg and there's a gutsy and authoritative fifty from Hussey, from 82 balls;
33.3;1;Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run flicked to leg;
33.2;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run nasty bouncer. That flew - that really shot through;
33.1;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run ooh, a good nut from Flintoff - cuts back sharply on Clarke who shouldered arms;
32.6;?;Onions to Hussey, no run a full toss but he escapes major punishment, Pietersen cleaning up at mid-off;
32.5;4;Onions to Hussey, FOUR runs four! Oh yes. Beautiful shot - Hussey has looked supremely confident today. Here, he comes forward and drives through extra cover with the ball right under his nose;
32.4;W;Onions to Katich, OUT this is up in the air at fine leg - what a catch! A stunner from Broad. On the pull, he top-edged it and Broad ran 10 or 12 yards to his right before diving, taking it low. Brilliant;Simon Katich c Broad b Onions 48 (141m 93b 6x4 0x6) SR: 51.61;
32.3;?;Onions to Katich, no run good length but too wide. Left alone comfortably;
32.2;?;Onions to Katich, no run short of a length and left alone outside off;
32.1;?;Onions to Katich, no run firmly spanked to mid-off;
31.6;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run ignored outside off;
31.5;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run very well bowled. Holds its line and, though it was a little too short, that wasn't far away from the off stump;
31.4;1;Flintoff to Katich, 1 run on the off stump Katich, as ever, shuffles to the off side and nudges to leg;
31.3;?;Flintoff to Katich, no run leaves this alone outside off, and again Flintoff's getting good lift off a decent length;
31.2;?;Flintoff to Katich, no run good length on the off stump and it's defended out to cover;
31.1;2;Flintoff to Katich, 2 runs uppishly driven, away from his body - not in control of that;
30.6;1;Onions to Katich, 1 run nudged off his hip and Australia's 100 is up;
30.5;4;Onions to Katich, FOUR runs banged down the ground. Power! Nothing more than a bunt down the ground and it fairly raced away for four;
30.4;1;Onions to Hussey, 1 run fuller delivery, squeezed out on the front foot;
30.3;4;Onions to Hussey, FOUR runs smashing shot. In every sense. Hussey has absolutely laced that through cover!;
30.2;?;Onions to Hussey, no run that's a cracker! A fine, fine delivery which shapes back on the left-hander who left it alone on length;
30.1;?;Onions to Hussey, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;
29.6;3;Flintoff to Hussey, 3 runs a confident push out past cover for a couple. Nicely played;
29.5;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run ooh well bowled - straight bouncer to which he sways out of the way. That flew through;
29.4;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run good pace (90.8mph), lifting up and away from the left-hander;
29.3;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run pushed out to the off side;
29.2;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run wide of the crease, helping with his angle across the left-hander. And what an angle it was. Obtuse;
29.1;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run left alone outside off;
28.6;2;Onions to Katich, 2 runs cuts this one straight down into the turf, it bounces over gully and Katich picks up a couple to finish the session;
28.5;?;Onions to Katich, no run angled across again, no shot offered, and no swing for Onions;
28.4;?;Onions to Katich, no run just outside off, Katich prods it back down the pitch;
28.3;?;Onions to Katich, no run pushed across and left alone;
28.2;1;Onions to Hussey, 1 run that's a vicious pull but just the single, he's so quickly into position for that one and slams it to deep midwicket, straight to the man on the boundary;
28.1;1;Onions to Katich, 1 run short of a length, Katich drops it to cover and they hurry through for a single;
27.6;?;Swann to Hussey, no run no turn again, straight ball and Hussey blocks it away;
27.5;?;Swann to Hussey, no run defended back down the pitch;
27.4;?;Swann to Hussey, no run yorker length, Hussey squeezes it out;
27.3;?;Swann to Hussey, no run pushed away towards point, no spin yet from Swann;
27.2;4;Swann to Hussey, FOUR runs that's a really good drive, he's picked a gap in the covers and it runs away to the boundary;

26.6;?;Onions to Katich, no run solid in defence this time;
26.5;?;Onions to Katich, no run fullish ball, this time Katich walks across - as he nearly always does - but then flicks a drive to mid-on;

26.3;?;Onions to Katich, no run no shot offered outside off;
26.2;4;Onions to Katich, FOUR runs fullish and wide, Katich flashes at a squarish drive and it races away to the cover-point boundary;
26.1;?;Onions to Katich, no run left alone outside off;
25.6;4;Broad to Hussey, FOUR runs a bouncer, predictably, but that's a magnificent pull from Hussey, he gets over it and hammers it forward of midwicket, it wasn't that wide of a diving Pietersen in the deep but it was struck with such force that he couldn't save the boundary;
25.5;?;Broad to Hussey, no run another bouncer, this time Hussey leaves it and Prior makes a terrific grab hurling himself to his left;
25.4;2;Broad to Hussey, 2 runs shouts of 'caaaatch', and that could easily have gone to hand in the deep, Hussey hooked a bouncer and couldn't keep it down, there's two men in the deep and it's landed safely a few metres wide of deep midwicket;
25.3;?;Broad to Hussey, no run short ball, Hussey sways out of the way;
25.2;1;Broad to Katich, 1 run tries to york Katich, but he flicks it comfortably through midwicket;
25.1;1;Broad to Hussey, 1 run on the pads again, Broad has strayed there too often, and it's easy to clip away to fine leg;
24.6;?;Onions to Katich, no run another leave outside off, and another fumble from Prior;
24.5;?;Onions to Katich, no run 91mph or 146kph, down leg side and Katich doesn't need to play;
24.4;?;Onions to Katich, no run tempting, tempting outside off and Katich chastises himself for chasing that one, it was wide outside off, moving away and he's lucky his slash didn't connect;
24.3;?;Onions to Katich, no run left alone outside off this time, Prior drops the take, which is probably something of a contradiction;
24.2;?;Onions to Katich, no run ah, that's a good'un! It's pitched on off and straightened off the seam sharply, also some extra bounce and it nips just past Katich's inside edge;
24.1;?;Onions to Katich, no run 90mph or 145kph, angled across Katich, who lets it go;
23.6;?;Broad to Hussey, no run short, Hussey shapes to pull but then checks himself as it sails past wide of off stump;
23.5;?;Broad to Hussey, no run full and straight, Hussey prods it to cover again;
23.4;?;Broad to Hussey, no run driven to cover;
23.3;4;Broad to Hussey, FOUR runs nicely placed this time, Hussey just guides a drive fractionally wide of the man diving at cover and his timing is good enough to reach the boundary;
23.2;?;Broad to Hussey, no run dead-batted away to the off side;
23.1;1;Broad to Katich, 1 run angled in to the pads, Katich clips it away to leg;
22.6;?;Onions to Hussey, no run oops, way down leg side;
22.5;?;Onions to Hussey, no run that one keeps a bit low, on off stump but Hussey is alert enough to get down to it;
22.4;?;Onions to Hussey, no run 'no run', says Hussey, echoing our scorer, as he bunts it to cover;
22.3;?;Onions to Hussey, no run 89mph or 143kph, Hussey defends to cover;
22.2;?;Onions to Hussey, no run left alone outside off;
22.1;4;Onions to Hussey, FOUR runs good shot, Hussey is quickly into position to pull a short one down and through midwicket for a comfortable boundary;
21.6;1;Broad to Hussey, 1 run clipped away through midwicket;
21.5;?;Broad to Hussey, no run straight-bat defence here, Broad isn't looking too threatening here;
21.4;?;Broad to Hussey, no run nudged into the off side again;
21.3;?;Broad to Hussey, no run pushed away to point;
21.2;2;Broad to Hussey, 2 runs too straight again, worked easily off his hips for a single;
21.1;1;Broad to Katich, 1 run on the legs, flicked away for a single behind square;
20.6;?;Onions to Hussey, no run bouncer, not a bad line but it's just a tad too high and Hussey is easily underneath it;
20.5;1;Onions to Katich, 1 run clipped away to midwicket and they scamper a single;
20.4;?;Onions to Katich, no run pushed across the left-hander, he leaves it to go through to Prior;
20.3;?;Onions to Katich, no run left alone outside off this time;
20.2;?;Onions to Katich, no run right up there again, very full to entice a drive, Katich does so to cover;
20.1;?;Onions to Katich, no run fullish outside off to start, Katich drives to mid-off;
19.6;?;Broad to Hussey, no run left alone outside off;
19.5;?;Broad to Hussey, no run good line, Broad gives a shout but it's hit bat and pad together and no umpire is likely to give that;
19.4;?;Broad to Hussey, no run pushed across Hussey, who leaves it alone;
19.3;4;Broad to Hussey, FOUR runs awful ball. A rank long-hop pulled around the corner for four;
19.2;3;Broad to Katich, 3 runs crashed through the off side, though without timing it;
19.1;4;Broad to Katich, FOUR runs four - off the bat I think. A leg-side stray. Broad's bowling himself into a long stay down at fine-leg, here, unless he sorts out his line;
18.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run goes for a big pull and nearly dragged this on! That was mighty, might close. Thank god for big boots;
18.5;1;Anderson to Katich, 1 run steals a single to leg;
18.4;?;Anderson to Katich, no run shuffles forward tentatively and prods it back to the bowler;
18.3;?;Anderson to Katich, no run wide of the crease, this bends back just a touch on Katich who tries to flash it through cover but the blade closes early, the ball working its way back to the bowler;
18.2;?;Anderson to Katich, no run Katich is well back in his crease, forcing this off the back foot;
18.1;?;Anderson to Katich, no run on the back foot, he defends out to cover;
17.6;?;Broad to Hussey, no run and it's ignored once more;
17.5;?;Broad to Hussey, no run too wide, left alone;
17.4;1;Broad to Katich, 1 run a short-arm punch off the back foot yields a single;
17.3;?;Broad to Katich, no run left alone outside off;
17.2;4;Broad to Katich, FOUR runs don't bowl there. Crisply punched square of the wicket - he is so strong there;
17.1;1;Broad to Hussey, 1 run well played by Hussey, who has looked in good and urgent form today. Nudges this to leg and steals a single;
16.6;?;Anderson to Katich, no run ooh, well he was late on that. Went to leave it and got a thick bottom edge;
16.5;?;Anderson to Katich, no run makes him play this time, but Katich is quite comfortable off the back foot;
16.4;?;Anderson to Katich, no run no no. A waste. Too wide;
16.3;?;Anderson to Katich, no run beaten! Beaten comprehensively - absolutely no footwork from the concreted Katich as he went for a horribly loose drive outside off;
16.2;?;Anderson to Katich, no run short, outside off and defended on the back foot;
16.1;?;Anderson to Katich, no run short of a length and Katich goes back, clunkily pushing it off the back foot - one hand coming off the bat;
15.6;?;Broad to Hussey, no run tripe. Way too wide, and it's raining;
15.5;?;Broad to Hussey, no run a waste, left alone;
15.4;?;Broad to Hussey, no run wide of the off stump;
15.3;?;Broad to Hussey, no run that was apparently 93.5mph. It so was not. Quick enough for Hussey, though, beating him on the outside edge;
15.2;1;Broad to Katich, 1 run flicked very late to the leg side. Broad throws his hands up partially in disgust, partially in frustration - a heady mix of the two - as he bent that back into the left-hander quite late;
15.1;?;Broad to Katich, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;
14.6;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run oh dear. Way, way too wide;
14.5;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run little bit too short and wide. Ignored;
14.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run ducks beneath a shorter delivery;
14.3;1;Anderson to Katich, 1 run on his legs, nudged neatly;
14.2;?;Anderson to Katich, no run miles down the leg side and Katich tries to pull it - dangerous stroke and I think he was out like that in Cardiff. No glove on it this time.;

13.6;?;Broad to Hussey, no run ignored outside off;
13.5;?;Broad to Hussey, no run left alone outside off;

13.3;?;Broad to Hussey, no run too wide, left alone;
13.2;?;Broad to Hussey, no run energetically punched to backward point. "Waiting. No!" is the noisy call;
13.1;?;Broad to Hussey, no run Broad begins well! Cuts back just a touch on the left-hander who shouldered arms. No chance of losing his off stump, but still, it was a stroke full of risk;
12.6;?;Anderson to Katich, no run nudged off his pad. Wrong line from Anderson;
12.5;2;Anderson to Katich, 2 runs good line but well played by Katich, gliding it behind square nicely for three. No, two - Hussey had a slip;
12.4;?;Anderson to Katich, no run angled across him, and he wisely leaves it alone;
12.3;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run on his legs, Hussey hustles a single to midwicket;
12.2;4;Anderson to Hussey, FOUR runs ah that's bewdyfull - straight down the ground for four. Nothing more than a check-push, timed exquisitely;
12.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run short of a length, he's back and defending;
11.6;?;Flintoff to Katich, no run 92mph or 149kph, Katich lets it go off his body behind square, takes a run but it's adjudged a dead ball as he didn't play a shot;
11.5;1;Flintoff to Hussey, 1 run yorker, but Hussey does well to keep it out and work it away to cover to get off the strike;
11.4;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run shortish ball, guided down to point;
11.3;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run left alone outside off;
11.2;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run pushed away to point;
11.1;?;Flintoff to Hussey, no run bouncer! Hussey ducks it, but didn't look terribly comfortable in doing so;
10.6;?;Anderson to Katich, no run angled bat from Katich, who guides it to gully;
10.5;?;Anderson to Katich, no run right on line, testing Katich on off stump, he defends back to the bowler;

10.2;1;Anderson to Hussey, 1 run on the pads and he works a single to fine leg;
10.1;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run and Anderson beats the bat this time, that's a good length, right on off stump and moving away a touch, Hussey can't get bat on it;
9.6;?;Flintoff to Katich, no run left alone this time;
9.5;?;Flintoff to Katich, no run golly gee, that's another great ball, angling in and seaming away, beating Katich's bat and Flintoff is really causing the batsman some headaches here;
9.4;?;Flintoff to Katich, no run left alone outside off;
9.3;?;Flintoff to Katich, no run 90mph or 145kph, short of a length and Katich defends;
9.2;?;Flintoff to Katich, no run oh! Play and a miss! That's the really dangerous Flintoff ball, angled in from around the wicket, pitching and seaming away, beats the outside edge;
9.1;4;Flintoff to Katich, FOUR runs bouncer, and that's well waited by Katich, who gets under it and guides an aerial cut over the cordon and away for four;
8.6;2;Anderson to Hussey, 2 runs this time Hussey beats the field and gets off the mark with a clip through midwicket;
8.5;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run moves across the batsman with the natural angle from over the wicket, Hussey leaves;
8.4;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run testing Hussey on middle-stump there, he clips it to Cook at leg gully;
8.3;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run right on target, Hussey drops it in front of him and thinks about a quick single, then reconsiders;
8.2;?;Anderson to Hussey, no run angled across Hussey, who lets it go;

7.2;?;Flintoff to Katich, no run 89mph or 144kph, defended on off stump;
7.1;?;Flintoff to Katich, no run left alone outside off;
6.6;W;Anderson to Ponting, OUT big appeal, and what's happened here? It was a dual lbw/caught appeal and Ponting is out caught at first slip! Angled in, there must've been an inside edge onto the pad and after Koertzen checks if the ball carried, he gives Ponting out!;Ricky Ponting c Strauss b Anderson 2 (19m 15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 13.33;
6.5;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run left alone outside off;
6.4;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run oh, Ponting drives at this one and it slams into the turf, he wants a quick single and then realises what a silly idea that would be;
6.3;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run angled in straighter now, Ponting falls across towards off and drives to mid-on;
6.2;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run a bit wider this time, Ponting lunges and leaves;
6.1;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run nice delivery, probing outside off and Ponting can't get bat on ball, that one just straightened ever so slightly;

 Innings Start



6.30pm But it's raining and off they go. 181 runs in that extended session for England, fairly rattling along they were, and that's stumps on the third day. England dominated the day, with Matt Prior and Paul Collingwood really pushing their scoring rate along to lead by 521. We'll have to wait until tomorrow to see if they bat for another 20 or 30 minutes, but it seems unlikely. Until tomorrow morning, then, it's goodnight from Brydon Coverdale, and it's goodnight from me. Goodnight. But don't forget to check out our free video highlights by clicking here (UK only).
Top knock from Collingwood who receives warm applause. No declaration from Strauss. Umpires are checking the light meters as Bambi comes trotting out
71.2;W;Siddle to PD Collingwood, OUT got him - a silent appeal. In fact, a non-appeal. Collingwood walks after edging behind. Australia barely celebrate;Paul Collingwood c ?Haddin b Siddle 54 (121m 80b 4x4 0x6) SR: 67.5;
71.1;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run clunked to mid-on;

70.4;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run clunked under-edge through to the keeper;
70.3;2;Johnson to Flintoff, 2 runs backs away again and drives to deep mid-off, easy, easy runs here, we're just marking time;

70.1;1;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run worked away to leg;
69.6;1;Siddle to PD Collingwood, 1 run yorker again, this time they get a single to leg;
69.5;?;Siddle to PD Collingwood, no run inswinging yorker this time, squeezed out by Collingwood;
69.4;1;Siddle to Flintoff, 1 run gives himself room and clunks a single away towards point;
69.3;?;Siddle to Flintoff, no run Siddle pleads for an lbw here but Rudi Koertzen quickly, inasmuch as he does anything quickly, shakes his head. Not a bad shout, but probably struck just outside the line playing a shot;
69.2;1;Siddle to PD Collingwood, 1 run pushed away through point for another run;
69.1;1;Siddle to Flintoff, 1 run backs away and works a single back past the bowler;
68.6;1;Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run flicked away to long-on;
68.5;4;Johnson to Flintoff, FOUR runs backs away and cuts hard and high over the cordon and wide of third man for yet another boundary;
68.4;1;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run Collingwood goes aerial now, off a thickish edge down to third man;
68.3;1;Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run Flintoff waits on it this time and cuts late, but third man cuts it off;
68.2;4;Johnson to Flintoff, FOUR runs lovely aerial drive over wide mid-off, Flintoff stepped right across outside off there and lifted it with ease;
68.1;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run fullish slower ball, Flintoff can't quite get bat on it;
67.6;?;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, no run pushed away to the off side;
67.5;2;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, 2 runs swings in, trying for the lbw, but Collingwood clips it through square once more;

67.3;?;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, no run tries to swivel a pull away but the ball didn't get up as much as expected;
67.2;?;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, no run angled in to the pads, Collingwood nudges to leg;
67.2;2nb;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, (no ball) 1 run punched away through the off side.;
67.1;1;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, 1 run driven to mid-off;
66.6;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run flicks the pad on the way through to haddin;
66.5;1;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run nudged to mid-on and they scamper through;
66.4;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run that's a grim sight for Australian fans. Johnson sprays a wide full toss that is so full that it doesn't bounce till it's past the stumps and off the cut strip;
66.3;1;Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run guided away behind point this time;
66.2;4;Johnson to Flintoff, FOUR runs short, wide, and Flintoff plays that one deftly, waiting on it to open the face and guide it over gully, great shot;
66.1;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run bouncer, but sails over Flintoff's head;
65.6;1;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, 1 run good inswing here, Flintoff punches an on-drive but can't quite beat the diving mid-on;
65.6;1nb;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, (no ball) swing and a miss! And a no-ball;
65.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run blocked away this time;
65.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run yorker, half a shout for lbw from Hilfenhaus but it's stifled. On review, he could have had a case there. I thought Flintoff had got bat on it, but he didn't. Possibly sliding down leg, although Hawkeye shows it clipping leg stump. No support from any of Hilfenhaus' team-mates for that appeal;
65.3;1;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, 1 run glanced to fine leg again, just the single on offer this time;
65.2;?;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, no run defended away safely;
65.1;2;Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, 2 runs flicked away to fine leg, boy oh boy, how did they get two there? Great running and judgment from Collingwood;

64.5;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run slower one wide of off, left alone;

64.3;1;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run good bouncer from Johnson, Collingwood swivels around as if to pull but almost looks as if he's trying to avoid it, either way it comes off the meat and away through square leg;
64.2;?;Johnson to PD Collingwood, no run driven to mid-on;
64.1;4;Johnson to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs a bit short, well played by Collingwood who punches a drive square through point;
63.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run blocked away safely;
63.5;4;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, FOUR runs cracking pull races away to the boundary, that's a fine way to get off the mark;
63.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run straight-bat defence this time;
63.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run good curve on that one, Flintoff drives sweetly but can't beat Katich at cover;
63.2;W;Hilfenhaus to Prior, 1 run, OUT oh, what a throw! What a magnificent throw from Marcus North in the ouftield. Prior drives it out to deep point and hares back for what looked like being two, but North's throw from the outfield has hit the one stump he had on offer! Prior is a good half-metre short, the third umpire confirms.;Matt Prior run out (North) 61 (50m 42b 9x4 0x6) SR: 145.23;
63.1;4;Hilfenhaus to Prior, FOUR runs great shot, simply opened the face and guided it behind gully for a boundary, all the way along the ground;
62.6;2;Hauritz to PD Collingwood, 2 runs sweeps it again, almost back onto the stumps;
62.5;1;Hauritz to Prior, 1 run nudges it away to midwicket for a single;
62.4;4;Hauritz to Prior, FOUR runs and this time Prior mixes things up by backing off a touch and pounding it forward of cover, uses his feet well there;

20.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run back-foot defence;
20.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run crunched to mid-off;
19.6;?;Siddle to Bopara, no run wide of the off stump;
19.5;4b;Siddle to Bopara, 4 byes frenzied cricket continues! Down the leg side, Haddin can't stop it - four more;
19.4;1;Siddle to Pietersen, 1 run Pietersen flicks this uppishly to leg, that ballooned into no-man's land;
19.3;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run squeezed out to the off side;
19.2;1;Siddle to Bopara, 1 run timed off his legs;
19.1;?;Siddle to Bopara, no run Ponting has dropped a dolly. Ponting has dropped him at second slip. I do not believe it. Thick outside edge, the ball loops tamely to Ponting who crouches, getting his fingers upwards in front of his face, and somehow - somehow - he shells it;
18.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run beaten! Hilfenhaus is all over Pietersen like overgrown ivy. Wonderful outswinger, beats him on length;
18.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run much too wide;
18.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run touch too wide, though nice, encouraging outswing;
18.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run wide of the off stump;
18.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run wow - that's close! That's got to be out! Late swing into Pietersen but the replays show he got a thin edge on it into his pad. But wait - he could be run out here as he's drifted out of his crease - the ball misses the stumps!;
18.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Pietersen, no run wide of the off stump and it swings away from the right-hander;
17.6;?;Siddle to Bopara, no run wide of the off stump;
17.5;?;Siddle to Bopara, no run defended on the back foot;
17.4;4;Siddle to Bopara, FOUR runs Siddle's furious - absolutely fuming - as Bopara comes forward and delicately opens the face, running it down to third man;
17.3;3;Siddle to Pietersen, 3 runs on middle stump, and bread-and-butter for Pietersen who flips it to leg and times it brilliantly. Not enough for four;
17.2;2;Siddle to Pietersen, 2 runs ever so slightly fuller, and on his legs, Pietersen whips it to leg;
17.1;?;Siddle to Pietersen, no run Pietersen walks across to the off side, defending under his nose. Emphatic defence;
16.6;1;Hauritz to Pietersen, 1 run nicely played, skipping back and nudging to leg;
16.5;4;Hauritz to Pietersen, FOUR runs well, that's four. And a solid, thumping flick it was too, skipping down the pitch and lofting him over midwicket. Yet you just have that nagging concern in your gut that suggests Pietersen is determined to assert his authority a little too soon in his innings (plural) at the moment;
16.4;?;Hauritz to Pietersen, no run left alone outside off - watches it carefully into Haddin's gloves. No turn there;
16.3;?;Hauritz to Pietersen, no run Pietersen lunges forward into a defensive pat;
16.2;W;Hauritz to Strauss, OUT got him! Hauritz sorts his line out, flighting it much closer to the off stump and drawing Strauss into a drive - takes the outside edge and flies to first slip - a classical offspinner's dismissal;Andrew Strauss c Clarke b Hauritz 32 (64m 48b 4x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
16.1;?;Hauritz to Strauss, no run that's hit a crack! Very wide of Strauss but it spat viciously and headed towards first slip;
15.6;4;Siddle to Bopara, FOUR runs Siddle is furious as Bopara gets a thick outside edge - soft hands, opening the face a touch;
15.5;?;Siddle to Bopara, no run defended on the back foot;
15.4;1;Siddle to Strauss, 1 run flicked to leg;
15.3;1;Siddle to Bopara, 1 run flicked through midwicket for a single - timed it remarkably well, actually, hence only a single;
15.2;3;Siddle to Strauss, 3 runs elegant drive through the off side, not timing it particularly well, but it'll earn him three;
15.1;?;Siddle to Strauss, no run good length, left alone outside off. No swing there;
14.6;?;Hauritz to Bopara, no run good line. Defended on the back foot;
14.5;?;Hauritz to Bopara, no run pats forward and presents an orthodox forward defensive;
14.4;?;Hauritz to Bopara, no run on the back foot - quicker delivery - and he defends crisply;
14.3;4b;Hauritz to Bopara, 4 byes tries to tickle this and it comes off his boot, I think, past Haddin for four;
14.2;?;Hauritz to Bopara, no run prods forward to defend;
14.1;W;Hauritz to Cook, OUT got him! Excellent delivery, nice and full, and it turns just enough on Cook whose head fell over, as it so often does, and that's taking out middle-and-leg;Alastair Cook lbw b Hauritz 32 (54m 42b 6x4 0x6) SR: 76.19;
13.6;?;Siddle to Strauss, no run stroked back to the bowler;
13.5;?;Siddle to Strauss, no run stroked back to the bowler - didn't give it the fully humpty. Just half a humpty. A hum, if you like;
13.4;?;Siddle to Strauss, no run too wide of the off stump this time, and Strauss lets it sail by;
13.3;4;Siddle to Strauss, FOUR runs ah, top shot, but a poor ball on his legs, neatly clipped through midwicket and timing it exquisitely;
13.2;?;Siddle to Strauss, no run lovely cover drive, straight to cover;
13.1;?;Siddle to Strauss, no run full toss, stroked out to the off side;
12.6;?;Hauritz to Cook, no run defended to off this time;
12.5;?;Hauritz to Cook, no run left alone outside off;
12.4;1;Hauritz to Strauss, 1 run clipped away through square now;
12.3;2;Hauritz to Strauss, 2 runs that's a lovely sweep from Strauss but there's men patrolling all parts of the boundary now, Siddle cuts it off;
12.2;1;Hauritz to Cook, 1 run on off stump, no turn and it's guided behind point;
12.1;1;Hauritz to Strauss, 1 run cut away to deep point for a single;
11.6;?;Siddle to Cook, no run on off stump, pushed back down the pitch;
11.5;?;Siddle to Cook, no run pushed wide across Cook this time, he's not tempted to drive, though he has been driving wonderfully already today;
11.4;?;Siddle to Cook, no run left alone outside off;
11.3;?;Siddle to Cook, no run pushed back down the pitch, no swing or seam movement here;
11.2;?;Siddle to Cook, no run pushed across Cook, who lets it go;
11.1;?;Siddle to Cook, no run on leg stump, Cook doesn't quite get this one, it bobs up off the pad to the off side;
10.6;?;Hauritz to Strauss, no run pushed away to off;

10.1;?;Hauritz to Strauss, no run on off, no spin, and it's defended;

Time for something a bit slower. Here's Hauritz.
 Innings Start
So that wraps up our live coverage of what has been a monumentally exciting Test. England dominated for the vast majority and were deserved winners with Strauss and Flintoff the stars. For Australia, well, they have plenty to work on before the third Test at Edgbaston. They may not have lost a Lord's Test since 1934 but the good news for Australian fans is that they went on to win that series. Stick around for all the post-match coverage from Alex Brown, Peter English and Andrew Miller. You can start off by checking out the final-day bulletin. And check out the video highlights (UK only). From me, Brydon Coverdale, and Will Luke, it's goodbye for now.
1pm Right, time for the presentations.
Ricky Ponting: "We've always enjoyed playing here, we've had a very proud record here. We were outplayed right through the course of the game, England have been the better team. We've got to bounce back pretty quickly."
"I'm pretty proud of the way we fought the game out. Our bowling in the second innings was as good as it's been through the series. But after lunch on day one we were chasing our tail."
And there's a clap going around Lord's as Ponting comments on the umpiring: "It's all irrelevant. We've been beaten by over 100 runs in a Test." He says Australia can only focus on what they can do to improve.
Andrew Strauss steps up now with a gigantic grin on his face: "It's been a really special victory. To win an Ashes Test match at Lord's is something that plenty of guys have dreamed about over the last 50 or 60 years. We're not going to get carried away, there's plenty of time left in the series."
And Strauss gives special mention to Flintoff, who he says was "magnificent" today. He also admits to a bit of indecision about whether to enforce the follow-on.
"Our medical team will be monitoring him over the coming days but we're still confident of having a fit squad to pick from for the third Test," Strauss says of Kevin Pietersen.
And the Man of the Match is ... drum-roll ... Andrew Flintoff. "A real team performance," he says. Was there any chance Strauss could get the ball out of your hand this morning? "Mate, there was no chance."
And there's a flat "no" when he's asked if he has any thoughts of un-retiring. Although he knows how hard it will be to get through the series and keep up this work-rate.
12.45pm What a victory for England, who have gone 1-0 up and are now in a wonderful position in the series. Flintoff grabs one of the stumps and acknowledges the crowd, gets hugs from all his team-mates after what can only be described as a matchwinning spell this morning, in his last Lord's Test. Fittingly, it's Flintoff who leads England off the field, clapping a stump and the ball together and he gets a standing ovation.
What an exhausting 105 minutes this morning! I can't imagine how tense it was for the players. Test cricket at its best.
"Fred getting that wicket in the first over calmed everyone down," Graeme Swann says. "We knew it was a massive ask for them."
"I was just praying all day yesterday that he'd advance past one," Swann says of the Clarke dismissal. "And it was second ball today."
So it's a 115-run victory, England's first Ashes win at Lord's since 1934. Wow.
106.6;W;Swann to Johnson, OUT gone! That's it! A 75-year-drought ends as Swann gets one through the advancing Johnson;Mitchell Johnson b Swann 63 (94m 75b 9x4 0x6) SR: 84;
106.5;?;Swann to Johnson, no run another marvellous ball, drifts in, turns past the bat and narrowly misses off stump;
106.4;?;Swann to Johnson, no run tossed up again, Johnson drives to cover;
106.3;2;Swann to Johnson, 2 runs Johnson connects this time, with a slog sweep that is cut off on the boundary by Bopara;
106.2;?;Swann to Johnson, no run almost! Tosses it up well wide of off, Johnson looks to slog-sweep and it fizzes past the bat;
106.1;1;Swann to Hilfenhaus, 1 run pushes a single away through cover;
105.6;4;Flintoff to Johnson, FOUR runs brilliant shot! Nothing more than a defensive push, dug out on the off stump, straight back down the ground for four;
105.5;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run excellent delivery on the off stump. Johnson goes back to defend on the back foot;
105.4;2;Flintoff to Johnson, 2 runs short of a length and pushed off the back foot for one. No - two. Well run;
105.3;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run swing and a miss outside off! That was heading into Berkshire if he connected with that. Or Kent. Somewhere outside London. Not far away from edging it either;
105.2;2;Flintoff to Johnson, 2 runs brilliant yorker! Dug out excellently. That was a fine, fast, deadly delivery;
105.1;2;Flintoff to Johnson, 2 runs and that's carved out square of the wicket, Johnson playing away from his body here but timing it nicely. This little innings might give him a bit of confidence for the Edgbaston Test, and indeed Australia's warm-up against Northants beforehand;
104.6;1;Swann to Johnson, 1 run tossed up a little slower and nudged to leg;
104.5;?;Swann to Johnson, no run darts one in full! Very, very full and dug out;
104.4;1;Swann to Hilfenhaus, 1 run defended out to the off side;
104.3;2;Swann to Hilfenhaus, 2 runs squeezed out on the front foot;
104.2;?;Swann to Hilfenhaus, no run squeezed out on the front foot;
104.1;1;Swann to Johnson, 1 run tossed up and he defends;
103.6;W;Flintoff to Siddle, OUT gone! Flintoff is mobbed by his team-mates here as he angles one in and gets between Siddle's bat and pad, crashes into middle stump! Five-for, for Flintoff, and England are one wicket from a monumental triumph.;Peter Siddle b Flintoff 7 (18m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 53.84;
103.6;1nb;Flintoff to Siddle, (no ball) inswinging yorker now, but it's kept out by Siddle and in any case Flintoff has overstepped;
103.5;1;Flintoff to Johnson, 1 run driven down to mid-off and they hare through for a single;
103.4;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run around the wicket now, bangs it in to the hips and Johnson works it to leg;
103.3;1;Flintoff to Siddle, 1 run flicked away to fine leg;
103.2;?;Flintoff to Siddle, no run another inducker, Siddle clips to midwicket;
103.1;?;Flintoff to Siddle, no run angled in to Siddle, who defends;
102.6;?;Swann to Johnson, no run yorks him, Johnson just squeezes it out;
102.5;4;Swann to Johnson, FOUR runs Johnson couldn't resist any longer, slog sweeps it superbly over midwicket and it bounces over the boundary;
102.4;?;Swann to Johnson, no run quicker ball this time, Johnson drives to cover;
102.3;?;Swann to Johnson, no run drifting in and Johnson defends;
102.2;?;Swann to Johnson, no run some turn there but it's well outside off;
102.1;?;Swann to Johnson, no run 'real good, Swann song', says Prior as Johnson drives to mid-off. He could equally have been talking to Flintoff;
101.6;?;Flintoff to Siddle, no run angled in to off, looking to get through the gate, but Siddle shuts said gate;
101.5;?;Flintoff to Siddle, no run a bit closer outside off, but it's shorter so Siddle can leave it again;
101.4;?;Flintoff to Siddle, no run hangs it outside off and Siddle doesn't have to play;
101.3;1;Flintoff to Johnson, 1 run this one looks like a defensive prod, but it beats Flintoff and they get a single to mid-off;
101.2;4;Flintoff to Johnson, FOUR runs glorious off-drive, times that one wonderfully and it races away to the boundary;
101.1;1;Flintoff to Siddle, 1 run worked to leg and Siddle gets away from the strike;
100.6;1;Swann to Siddle, 1 run prodded away to cover for a single;
100.5;?;Swann to Siddle, no run straight ball, Siddle closes the face and works it to leg;
100.4;1;Swann to Johnson, 1 run worked away to the off side;
100.3;2;Swann to Johnson, 2 runs nudged away behind point;
100.2;?;Swann to Johnson, no run dropped! Oh my, Swann has almost held on to a stunner there. Driven hard back to his right, he thrusts the right hand out and the ball looks to stick, but as he falls onto the ground it bobs out. So, so close;
100.1;4;Swann to Johnson, FOUR runs lovely square drive from Johnson, through point for four;
99.6;4;Flintoff to Siddle, FOUR runs yorker, Siddle does well to squeeze it through leg and somehow gets a boundary from it;
99.5;?;Flintoff to Siddle, no run nudged back down the pitch defensively and the crowd sighs;
99.4;W;Flintoff to Hauritz, OUT that's out! Fullish, jagging back sharply off the seam and Hauritz lets it go, and it goes crashing into off stump;Nathan Hauritz b Flintoff 1 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
99.3;?;Flintoff to Hauritz, no run pushed back to the bowler safely;
99.2;2lb;Flintoff to Hauritz, 2 leg byes half a shout, which probably equates to a murmur, angling down leg and it runs away fine;
99.1;?;Flintoff to Hauritz, no run nudged down to off;
98.6;?;Swann to Johnson, no run quicker, Johnson does well to defend it;
98.5;4;Swann to Johnson, FOUR runs around the wicket to Johnson, who clips nicely through midwicket and gets a boundary despite a quick chase from Broad;
98.4;?;Swann to Johnson, no run driven to cover;
98.3;1;Swann to Hauritz, 1 run Hauritz drives to mid-on first up;
98.2;W;Swann to Clarke, OUT bowled him! Fantastic ball! Swann tosses it up, Clarke comes down the pitch as he always does, but has yorked himself as it spins back sharply into him to knock out his off stump;Michael Clarke b Swann 136 (313m 227b 14x4 0x6) SR: 59.91;
98.1;?;Swann to Clarke, no run jumps down the pitch, makes it into a full toss and cracks it to short extra-cover;
97.6;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run fuller delivery smashed on the up straight to cover;
97.5;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run flicked to leg. Johnson is miles back in his crease;
97.5;1nb;Flintoff to Johnson, (no ball) forced off the back foot out to cover;
97.4;2;Flintoff to Johnson, 2 runs steps back, thinks about hooking but just paddles it around the corner;
97.3;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run my word, what a bouncer. The surprise bouncer which spits up at Johnson's neck - that could've gone anywhere! Fended off his glove to the off side;
97.2;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run angled across Johnson. Left alone on width;
97.1;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run waits for it on the back foot, then stands tall to drive. Not much feet movement from Johnson, which isn't abnormal, he's a great, natural timer of the all;
96.6;3;Broad to Johnson, 3 runs angling into Johnson who plays it really well, prodding it down the ground and timing it very well indeed. They nearly ran four there;
96.5;4;Broad to Johnson, FOUR runs on the drive - on the up, too - and that's four more to Johnson, driving square of the wicket. In front of square, actually;
96.4;?;Broad to Johnson, no run beaten outside off! A little wafty fish by Johnson who didn't move his feet at all, and it kept coming in at him before cutting, just a touch, away from his outside edge;
96.3;?;Broad to Johnson, no run good line just outside off and coming in on the angle. Johnson blocks to cover;
96.2;?;Broad to Johnson, no run short of a length and Johnson shoulders arms;
96.1;?;Broad to Johnson, no run now that's a superb yorker! Johnson stepped nervously away to the leg side, digging it out nevertheless quite nicely. Touch of reverse swing there for Broad;
95.6;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run firmly defended on the back foot;
95.5;3;Flintoff to Johnson, 3 runs short and wide, clunked off the back foot. Bopara and Anderson give chase in an attempted relay-throwing exerciser but Bopara does all the work and flings in an accurate throw;
95.4;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run so close to bowling him here! Johnson nervously went back and fended it, the ball bouncing over the stumps. The luck's with Johnson here. Not far away at all!;
95.3;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run rapped on the pads, beaten for pace, but it pitched outside leg. Half-hearted appeal. Johnson looks uncomfortable against pace and this is a good length;
95.2;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run beaten by another, well...remarkable ball really. Though Flintoff is producing them so often that they're not that remarkable. Leg-cutter to the left-hander at about 92mph;
95.1;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run Johnson clamps down on this on the front foot. "Get hold of it," is the vocal demand from Prior to Cook at short-leg, who sprints across to field;
94.6;4;Broad to Clarke, FOUR runs oh what a stroke - flashing off-drive past mid-off for four! Timed the leather off that;
94.5;?;Broad to Clarke, no run yikes. A horrid wide;
94.4;2;Broad to Clarke, 2 runs supreme cover drive, though doesn't quite time it as well as he likes. Absolutely oozes class, though - head right over the ball. Bopara sprints 20 yards to hawl it back;
94.3;1;Broad to Johnson, 1 run outside off, Johnson drives and gets a thick edge short of Flintoff at second slip who dives and makes a good stop. That was not far away at all. An inch short. Excellent, probing line;
94.2;1;Broad to Clarke, 1 run pushed nicely out to point for a single;
94.1;?;Broad to Clarke, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;
93.6;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run defended on the back foot;
93.5;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run shuffles back to defend;
93.4;4;Flintoff to Johnson, FOUR runs shot - shot! Fantastic hook/pull in front of square and played it down, rolling his wrists. Two men in the deep but it bisected them both;
93.3;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run fuller, straighter delivery at 92mph and it's defended well, and solidly, on the back foot;
93.2;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run goes on the pull and that comes off his shoulder, I think, the ball flying short of the slips. He's not comfortable against this bouncer war;
93.1;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run horrid bouncer aiming for his neck, but Johnson is tall and plays this well, fending it safely down to the off side;
92.6;?;Broad to Clarke, no run good length but a touch too wide;
92.5;?;Broad to Clarke, no run that's too wide. Left alone;
92.4;1;Broad to Johnson, 1 run on his legs and tucked to leg for a tension-dissipating single;
92.3;1;Broad to Clarke, 1 run too wide and forced off the back foot to point;
92.2;?;Broad to Clarke, no run cuts back again - good, full delivery;
92.1;?;Broad to Clarke, no run he starts well with a fine off-cutter that's defended solidly on the front foot;
91.6;4;Flintoff to Johnson, FOUR runs smash! Johnson carves him over cover. Bosh. What an aggressive, combative stroke that is - planted his feet and swung through the line;
91.5;2;Flintoff to Johnson, 2 runs superb shot. An attempted yorker flicked beautifully off his toes;
91.5;1nb;Flintoff to Johnson, (no ball) a massive full toss on his pads and that would've been out - but a no-ball! A no-ball. Could've cleaned Johnson up for good;
91.4;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run does a bit of a Jack Russell here and drags his bat inside the line. Well played;
91.3;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run shorter delivery and fast. This is an inspired spell! Spits off a length, Johnson plays it well, dropping his hands low;
91.2;1;Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run Clarke plays this really well, willing himself forward ala Ponting. Nudges to leg and steals a single;
91.1;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run fabulous, jagging off-cutter. That almost rattled into Clarke's family jewels. Half an appeal from Flintoff;
90.6;4;Anderson to Johnson, FOUR runs fine stroke, but Anderson won't mind him driving like that outside off. Better, fuller length. Elegantly played, without a doubt. Cook gives chase but can't reach it;
90.5;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run confidently defended on the back foot out to cover;
90.4;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run swings back into Johnson, just short of a good length, who defends crisply off the back foot. Bat straight.;
90.3;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run good line but too short. Johnson's comfortable on the back foot. Touch of movement back into the left-hander;
90.2;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run and that's a nice one for Johnson - wide of the off stump. A nice little sighter. Temporary relief;
90.1;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run sharp delivery and Johnson plays it late, though thought about leaving it. Excellent, diving, urgent stop by Pietersen in the gully. England are all over them here like a rash;
89.7;1b;Flintoff to Johnson, 1 bye what a delivery to end the over! An absolute snorter! This spell by Flintoff is threatening to match his over against Ponting in 2005, and against Kallis in 2008. Johnson fends and misses, but only by a millimetre;
89.6;1nb;Flintoff to Johnson, (no ball) edged short of second slip! Johnson was much, much too late on that, though it was seriously fast. The perfect delivery to a left-hander;
89.5;1;Flintoff to Clarke, 1 run Clarke gets off strike with a tuck to leg;
89.4;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run and he follows it up with a rip-snorting jaffa! 93mph for the second time in this over, fuller, and it leaves Clarke on a length! Quite brilliant. Unplayable;
89.3;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run and he's hit him. He's hit him nastily. A shorter bumper that follows him like a missile, and he ducks into it - just cannot get away from it. His face winces as the ball smashes into his helmet. That could've been really, really nasty. Must have a damn good helmet;
89.2;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run swings back late on Clarke who comes a little but late forward, digging it out;
89.1;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run that is quick. An inswinging yorker dug out by Clarke and I think that's chipped his bat. He had problems with it last night, too, taping it up;
88.6;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run crashed to mid-off. Timed that well, though it was just a defensive push;
88.5;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run too wide, really. Johnson shoulders arms;
88.4;?;Anderson to Johnson, no run wide of Johnson who leaves it alone;
88.3;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run sweet flick to leg as Anderson's line strays for the first time this morning. As he's shown for almost his entire innings, Clarke seizes on anything even remotely loose;
88.2;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run just a touch fuller, inviting the drive and Clarke accepts with a front-footed and elegant off-drive to mid-off. More encouraging inswing for Anderson who has been absolutely on the money in his first eight balls;
88.1;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run a big inswinger and Clarke shoulders arms. Left alone on length. Very, very good line from Anderson;
87.6;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run defended on the back foot a little nervously;
87.5;?;Flintoff to Johnson, no run very good ball. Johnson's practically sitting on his stumps here and only just gets bat on it in time;
87.4;W;Flintoff to Haddin, OUT got him! Got him! He's out. A superb line and length, and Haddin feels for it to edge it low to Collingwood at second slip who takes a fine catch;Brad Haddin c Collingwood b Flintoff 80 (187m 130b 10x4 0x6) SR: 61.53;
87.3;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run beaten for pace, raps him on the pads but it's down the leg side. Big inside edge, actually - and where's the short-leg?;
87.2;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run good line and length - if just a touch too short. Haddin on the back foot defends;
87.1;?;Flintoff to Haddin, no run good start on the off stump. Haddin defends;
86.6;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run superb line and length, Clarke leaves alone;
86.5;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run touch wider and left alone. We can breath again;

86.3;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run another booming inswinger but it's on the middle stump and comfortably tucked to leg;
86.2;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run another big shout as Clarke flicks this off his pad - great take by Prior down the leg side, but Anderson doesn't think about appealing;

85.3;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run a bouncer, ducked beneath by the batsman;

84.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run great shot, drilled down the ground - what power - but Anderson stopped it with his size 12s;
84.2;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs a horrible, flashing shot but it flies over the slips for four! Strauss and Flintoff didn't have a hope;

82.4;4;Anderson to Clarke, FOUR runs wrong line - absolutely the wrong line. Beautifully clipped off leg stump for four more elegant runs;
82.3;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run defended out to the off side. "No," calls Haddin, but Clarke demands a single;
82.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run beaten by a jaffa! You could hear the batsman cry "ooof" there as he wafted his bat loosely outside off;
82.1;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run the wrong line from Anderson, too straight and it's picked off his pads for another single - and nearly two as Bopara fumbled in the deep, as he has done several times today;

81.5;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run defended on the back foot;
81.4;4;Flintoff to Clarke, FOUR runs thick outside edge at very catchable height between third slip and gully! Ouch. Genuine loose shot from the right-hander;

80.1;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run and Anderson starts with a wide ball outside off;
79.6;4;PD Collingwood to Haddin, FOUR runs slower half-volley outside off, Haddin gets the timing right and drives it through cover, another excellent stroke and Onions in the outfield dives in vain;
79.5;?;PD Collingwood to Haddin, no run on the pads, worked to short midwicket;
79.4;4;PD Collingwood to Haddin, FOUR runs lovely, soft hands, waits on it nicely and opens the face to guide a late cut to third man;

77.1;?;PD Collingwood to Clarke, no run driven to mid-off;
76.6;?;Swann to Haddin, no run defended back down the pitch;
76.5;4;Swann to Haddin, FOUR runs awful ball. That's all there is to it. A rank long hop that Haddin pulls through square leg and despite a despairing dive on the boundary it tickles into the rope;
76.4;?;Swann to Haddin, no run turns on to the legs, Haddin turns it to leg;
76.3;?;Swann to Haddin, no run pushed back down the pitch;
76.2;?;Swann to Haddin, no run turned to leg;
76.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run defended away this time;

72.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run drifts it across from around the wicket, no shot offered;

67.5;4b;Anderson to Haddin, 4 byes Rudi Koertzen looks a bit like he's doing the royal wave here as he signals byes, a full toss down leg that Prior can't get a hand on;

52.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run waits and waits on the back foot before flicking to leg;
52.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run shorter, quicker - the arm ball perhaps, scuttling through low;
