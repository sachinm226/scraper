Data
Phew, what a 50 overs that was! England have set a new world record for men's ODIs, breaking their own mark of 444, with thunderous hundreds from Bairstow and Hales. They were on for 500 before Australia finally started to get their yorkers in during the final few overs, but by then the damage was well and truly done.
Mayank Gupta: "Its really astonishing to see two 450+ LA scores on the same day and in the same country! India A scored 458 against Leicesteshire too today..."
Waseem: "Last 30 deliveries bowled gone without any boundary from the bat, that shows it could be 500 easily where English stood at a time."
I'm off to catch by breath for a while and Miller will be back with you for the start of Australia's chase

49.2;2;Tye to Ali, 2 runs crunches a length ball from outside off straight down the ground, long-off can't stop the second;
49.1;1;Tye to Root, 1 run heaves a length ball high into the leg side, no timing at all, and falls short of long-on;

48.5;3nb;Stoinis to Ali, (no ball) 2 runs taken at deep midwicket, it's another big full toss, and the umpires are checking for height...it's borderline, but this is called no-ball as well. Langer has a rueful smile on the balcony;

33.5;2;Stanlake to Hales, 2 runs pounded high and mightily into the leg side, more height than might in fact ... more of a sand wedge out to no-man's land at cow corner;

33.3;1;Stanlake to Hales, 1 run fuller length, outside off, slashed to deep cover;

47.2;W;Jhye Richardson to Hales, OUT taken at deep midwicket...Hales had just started to lose his shape in the last few minutes. He heaves a length delivery a long way into the air and it's comfortably taken;Alex Hales c Agar b Richardson 147 (92b 16x4 5x6) SR: 159.78;

46.5;2nb;Tye to Hales, (no ball) 1 run caught off a no-ball, called for height...big full toss from Tye, Hales was coming down the pitch, umpire's decide it would have been above waist height in his normal stance. Took a top edge as Hales swung at it.;

Wasteful from him, but it's Short at deep square again who's pulled off the run out. He's been superb the last few overs. Roy was the one who called for the second. Short's arm is excellent.

Terrific delivery, short of a length and nipping back at Roy, cuts him in half. Is it inside edge or trouser pocket? Appears to miss the bat and clip the back leg. Super take, diving to his left, but this won't coun;

Just a few minutes away from the action...Billy Stanlake will open the bowling. Two slips in place
Jak King: "Beautiful early morning (6am) here in Vancouver. Looking forward to another England win!"
1.50pm Jitin Kumar: "Starting my day in the US East Coast with a coffee, computer and cricinfo. Hi everyone!!" The Three Cs!
Duncan Ward: "I agree with Mihir, Aaron Finch has been so successful as an opener, don't understand why he's the one who is dropped so far down the order."
1.35pm Gregor Reis: "Following your commentary from Honningsvag - the most northerly point on mainland Europe. 24 hours of daylight!!" Welcome, Gregor
Kev: "England fan sat following the commentary with you in Kusadasi, Turkey, while watching the football & drinking a beer! Morgan century today. "
Mihir: "i think Australia should change their batting order. 1)Short 2) Finch 3)Marsh 4) Head 5)Maxwell 6) Stoinis 7) Paine 8) Agar 9) Tye 10) Richardon 11) Stanlake. this will give more balance to their batting."
Australia win the toss and will bowl
England 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Jason Roy, 3 Alex Hales, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan (capt), 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 David Willey, 9 Liam Plunkett, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Mark Wood
Australia 1 Travis Head, 2 D'Arcy Short, 3 Shaun Marsh, 4 Marcus Stoinis, 5 Aaron Finch, 6 Glenn Maxwell, 7 Tim Paine (capt & wk), 8 Ashton Agar, 9 Andrew Tye, 10 Jhye Richardson, 11 Billy Stanlake
So that's Kane Richardson out for Australia and Morgan slots back in for Billings for England
Eoin Morgan says he would have bowled as well. "It looks a fantastic wicket," he says
1.30pm Bob B: "English fan, sat here in Greece, working with Italians and a Spanish boss waiting for the Aussies to lose, so I can go home to Australia next week and be rude to my neighbours!"
1.20pm wcpak: "England will wrap up the series today. I don't see Australia having any options in putting up a quality XI to fight against this England team." Well, it looks like Billy Stanlake will be back so that's something.
Meanwhile, England have named their T20 squad today to face India and Australia. No place for Mark Wood or Dawid Malan
1.10pm Hello everyone and welcome to our coverage of the third ODI from Trent Bridge. Can Australia keep the series alive or will England wrap up another success?
It's been a rough time for Australia in one-day cricket and they have slumped to their lowest ranking in 34 years. However, Aaron Finch insists they can turn their fortunes around.
It's saying something about the expectations around this England side that their total of 343 in Cardiff felt a little lightweight. Still, that's a good problem to have. And when Ben Stokes returns one of the top order will have to make way. That looks like being Alex Hales and he knows it.
 Innings Start
England have won by 242 runs and take an unbeaten 3-0 lead in the series. Don't adjust your set, that is the margin. England largest runs victory, Australia's largest runs defeat. What a performance from the home side. Utterly, utterly dominate. Jonny Bairstow, Alex Hales, Eoin Morgan followed by seven wickets for Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid. Bairstow and Hales lead England. A chastened Australia come out to shake hands. Rough day for them. We'll bring you the presentations shortly. Meanwhile, have a read of Mel Farrell's view from the ground. When the burger-stand vendors were on alert for white missiles.
Jasdev: "Such identical performances by Bairstow and Hales.. in terms of runs scored, balls faced, boundaries scored, even on the field, one run-out/catch each. Tough call for MoM!"
Presentation time...Tim Paine "That was some of the best striking I've seen. Hats off to the English boys, they are red hot. On a positive side we are getting some games into the young guys. That was the hardest day I've had in 16-17 years. It was tough, no matter where we put the field they hit the gaps. They are the yardstick of 50-over cricket. Twelve months is a hell of a long time in cricket so things can turn for you quickly. We have six guys who potentially will come back in some will have depth and experience."
Eoin Morgan "Certainly a day for everyone in that changing room to be very proud of. The level of intensity was different to anything we've done in the last three years. It was as close to a complete performance as we've got to. Guys were relentless. A day to be proud. It's never a case of them just getting score, they operate at the strike-rate the team wants them to. There are two more opportunities to score big runs. [Selection] is a good headache to have. It really does keep the playing XI on their toes. Nice place to be with a year until the World Cup. When we get to Durham we'll reassess the bowlers and how they travel. Will be a case of managing the bowlers. We are 3-0 up but two more opportunities to win games of cricket. The way we look at it is that we need to be on top of our game if any trends change by next year. We have put ourselves into a position to adapt."
Man of the match is Alex Hales "As good as it gets, personally and from the team perspective. A special day. You'd have to rank it up there as better [than 2016], we are in a really good headspace as a team. The pool of talent is as good as it's been in one-day cricket. We have to perform day in day out. You are always striving to improve."
Before we leave you, here are some of the major records from today. Now we'll wrap it there for today. What a performance from England. Their thoughts will turn to 5-0 now. Australia will look to save face at Chester-le-Street and Old Trafford. We'll be back on Thursday but for now, from Gnasher and Miller, it's goodnight.
