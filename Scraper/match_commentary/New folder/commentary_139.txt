So Ishant Sharma will be on a hat-trick in the second innings. No wagging from Australia's last three wickets this time, although the Paine-Cummins stand has taken them to a very handy total. India will have the heavy roller you would think, but it will now be all eyes on what the Aussie quicks do with the new ball. The India openers will have a tricky period to bat before lunch.
Babel: "There might be some technical flaws in Rishabh Pant's keeping regarding movement and positioning, but no complaints about his catching! :)" Except the ones he drops.
I'm sure the Australia quicks won't need to be told, but how those last four wickets fell just reinforces the importance of pitching the ball up

 Innings Start
Yet again Lyon has done a brilliant job for his team. All the talk was about the fast men and he bags 5 for 67. Australia lead by 43 runs and now precious will that be? Lyon teams the Australians off, holding the ball aloft. The key wicket, as so often, was Virat Kohli who fell to Cummins. That opened things up for Australia. Overall the last six wickets fell for 60 and the last five for 32. Advantage Australia and India will need early inroads with the new ball before tea. Back with you in five minutes
