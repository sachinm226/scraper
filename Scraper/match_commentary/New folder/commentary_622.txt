Data
New Zealand finish on 290 for 6 - an excellent effort. The innings was set up by Vincent and Fulton who struck timely half-centuries to set up the platform. Vincent missed his century courtesy Shaun Tait who bowled a fiery and economical spell. The middle order chipped in with useful cameos and Australia have a fight on their hands. Join me in about 40 minutes for the chase.

Hello everybody and welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the penultimate group match of the Commonwealth Bank Series. New Zealand take on Australia in today's clash with one spot in the best-of-three final up for grabs. I'm George Binoy and I'll be bringing you the excitement as it unfolds at the MCG.
Toss: Stephen Fleming has won the toss and New Zealand will bat.
Fleming welcomed the additional pressure England's win against Australia put on them. This is what we wanted," said Fleming. "We want it to be a semi-final, a pressure game, where we continue the momentum we build. That's what the World Cup's about, so if anything we couldn't ask for much more. Scott Styris makes a comeback from injury and he replaces Craig McMillan in the starting line-up. Mark Gillespie replaces Jeetan Patel.
Ricky Ponting returns for this game after missing the previous one because of a hip-niggle. He replaces Andrew Symonds, who needs bicep surgery for the injury sustained at the SCG on Friday which means that Brad Hodge gets another chance after his dismissal for one against England. The fiery duo of Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson replace Glenn McGrath and Nathan Bracken in today's game. Shaun Tait, who was fast but rudderless at Sydney, gets another shot.
New Zealand 1 Lou Vincent, 2 Stephen Fleming (capt), 3 Peter Fulton, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Scott Styris, 6 Jacob Oram, 7 Brendon McCullum, 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 Mark Gillespie, 10 James Franklin, 11 Shane Bond.
Australia 1 Adam Gilchrist (wk), 2 Matthew Hayden, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Brad Hodge, 5 Michael Clarke, 6 Mike Hussey, 7 Cameron White, 8 Brett Lee, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Stuart Clark, 11 Shaun Tait.
Here's how it stands at the moment. Australia are already in the final with 27 points from seven games. New Zealand and England are on nine points each. If New Zealand win today then they are all but ensured of a place in the final. Click here to check out the points table and the other complications if New Zealand and England finish on equal points.
Asad Rauf and Steve Davis are the umpires for today. They're ready to do the business as is Brett Lee who has the new ball. He's bowling from over the wicket with two slips in place. Lou Vincent is on strike. Here we go, fingers crossed that it's a tight contest.
 Innings Start
Hodge leaves the ground to massive cheers. He had scores of 0 and 1 in the series before this and has put his hand up with an outstanding hundred at his home ground.
Vincent and Fulton set up the game nicely by powering New Zealand to 290. During the chase the asking-rate crept up to seven an over by the half-way stage but not once did Ponting or Hodge panic. Ponting led from the front with an super-cool century and Hodge overcame a nervy start to see Australia through to the target.

This defeat means that New Zealand and England are on equal points heading into the final group match at Brisbane on Tuesday. That match is a virtual semi-final and make sure you tune in for it. I've enjoyed bringing this game to you, thanks for all your emails. Cheers!
