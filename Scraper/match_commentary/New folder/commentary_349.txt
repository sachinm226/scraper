17.3;1;Tredwell to Finch, 1 run little bit wide and Finch drops back, cuts one through point to the sweeper;
17.2;?;Tredwell to Finch, no run there's an lbw appeal from Tredwell, think the ball hit pad before bat, but umpire S Ravi isn't interested. No one else was, really, but Morgan decides the go with his bowler and England review. This looks a little speculative, though it was definitely pad first ... the line is the key and Hawk-Eye adjudges the ball struck fractionally outside off, so Finch survives;
17.1;1;Tredwell to Clarke, 1 run tossed up, comes forward and worked with the spin into a gap on the leg side;
16.6;?;Bopara to Finch, no run touch back of a length, pushed to mid-on off the back foot;
16.5;?;Bopara to Finch, no run comes forward, hitting slightly across the line and the ball pings back to Bopara;
16.4;1;Bopara to Clarke, 1 run the bat turns in the hand as Clarke attempts an expansive drive, the ball screws away through square leg;
16.3;1;Bopara to Finch, 1 run little bit short and width for Finch to cue end one down to third man;
16.2;1;Bopara to Clarke, 1 run bangs this in short of a length, again Clarke is equal to it, keeping a pull shot down towards deep square leg;
16.1;1;Bopara to Finch, 1 run on the stumps, nurdled to leg for one more;
15.6;4;Rankin to Clarke, FOUR runs Clarke deals with this well enough, not really a bouncer from Rankin and it sits up to be pulled smartly through midwicket for four;
15.5;1;Rankin to Finch, 1 run little bit wide, Finch drives and gets a thick edge through gully/third slip, single down to third man;
15.4;?;Rankin to Finch, no run Finch gets forward to a length ball around off;
15.3;1;Rankin to Clarke, 1 run length, on the stumps and worked through square leg from deep in the crease;
15.2;?;Rankin to Clarke, no run half an appeal from Rankin, as he beats Clarke for pace on the inside, hits the pad ... heading down past leg, though;
15.1;?;Rankin to Clarke, no run dug in short, the ball rises to a good height on its way through as Clarke drops his hands inside the line;
14.6;1;Bopara to Clarke, 1 run width offered again, stays back and runs another single down to third man;

14.4;1lb;Bopara to Finch, 1 leg bye works the ball of the pads into the leg side;

14.1;1;Bopara to Clarke, 1 run little bit of width and Clarke steers cut-dab through point;

13.2;?;Rankin to Clarke, no run comes forward and blocks;
13.1;?;Rankin to Clarke, no run slightly back of a length and outside off, turned to leg;
12.6;1;Bopara to Clarke, 1 run width again, drops back and guides one down to third man;
12.5;?;Bopara to Clarke, no run length ball, wide of the stumps and chopped to point on the back foot;
12.4;W;Bopara to Watson, OUT length, outside off, Watson tries to cut off the back foot, he misses - or does he? Bopara is convinced he hit this and England review. We're into Clockwork Orange replay territory, the footage run over and over again from different angles; there's a definite sound as the ball passes, seemingly over the top edge - but the side-on, Hot Spot angle, has the ball going past the toe of the bat, and no heat mark. This is very tricky, as the different camera angles almost look like they're showing different deliveries... but Dar decides the audio is clear, there's nothing else the bat could have hit as the ball went through, and the decision is overturned. Watson has to go this time!;Shane Watson c ?Buttler b Bopara 38 (51m 51b 6x4 1x6) SR: 74.5;

11.5;?;Tredwell to Watson, no run turn for Tredwell, this spins back and cramps Watson as he tries to cut;
11.4;6;Tredwell to Watson, SIX runs bit more air on this and Watson gets to the pitch, clatters a big ole mow over wide long-on, there was a man out there but it clears him into the crowd;
11.3;?;Tredwell to Watson, no run worked off the front pad to midwicket;
11.2;?;Tredwell to Watson, no run pushed through, Watson comes forward and defends;

10.6;1;Bopara to Watson, 1 run on a length outside off, sits back and glides a single to third man;
10.5;?;Bopara to Watson, no run there's a mix up and England could have had a run-out at both ends! Watson pushed the ball to mid-off and both he and Finch set off before realising there wasn't a run, Root could have thrown it to Buttler at the striker's end, decided to have a shy at the bowler's end and missed, with both batsmen out of their ground;
10.4;?;Bopara to Watson, no run length ball, Watson pushes into the off side;
10.3;?;Bopara to Watson, no run Watson stays back, dangles his bat out horizontally and is beaten, Buttler taking it up to the stumps;

Australia won't be too unhappy after the Powerplay, especially after that wicket maiden to begin the innings. On comes Ravi Bopara at second change
 Innings Start
So that wraps up this first ODI. David Hopps has described in detail Australia's thumping victory and Dan Brettig is in position to bring us more reaction from Old Trafford later in the evening. The next match in the series is on Wednesday down at Edgbaston, so join us then for a floodlit match starting at 2pm BST but from Monty and I today it's goodbye.

Time for the Presentation and the losing captain Eoin Morgan: "Very disappointing. We can learn a lot form today, we struggled to adjust to conditions early with bat and ball. I wouldn't have made a different choice at the toss. We have a strong batting line up but we weren't good enough today. We lost wickets at unfortunate times. We have a lot of bowling options to turn to but today it was a case of not enough guys putting their hands up. Boyd's hit his straps straight away in international cricket and Jos played really well too."

And, finally, the successful skipper is Michael Clarke. who is also the Man of the Match: "It's a nice feeling. all the boys deserve credit, to make over 300 on that wicket was good effort and our bowlers did really well. It doesn't matter how you win but it's the result that matters, as England showed in the Test series. As a one-day outfit we're off to a good start. I'd like to play here all the time, it's a nice wicket. Conditions were really good for batting, there's so much talent in our dressing room and if our guys feel they want to take on a bowler no ground is big enough. George has been hitting the ball really well for a while now. And Mitch bowled with good pace, hopefully it's the start of a big series for him."

As for England, they made the wrong choice at the toss, failed to cap Australia's surge until the damage had been done and then never got close in the chase. Kevin Pietersen played nicely before a poor stroke ended the big innings that England needed from him. Eoin Morgan threatened to play his own big part but fell trying to push things on in the Powerplay. The main positive of the day for the hosts was Jos Buttler who answered questions of whether he can bat a long time with a careful innings that still contained his trademark power. Something to work with but it was the only thing in the plus column of Ashley Giles's notes.

Australia's bowling effort was probably the more impressive part of the match. They had Mitchell Johnson in great form, bowling with pace and aggression and ripping out two early wickets to handicap England's effort. It was a sign that perhaps Johnson will be ready to return to Test duty come Novemeber. He was backed up exceptionally well by Clint McKay who operated well with the new ball and deceived England with slower balls galore as the innings went on. James Faulkner was useful too.

End of the game and Australia have dominated today, winning by 88 runs and it was a complete performance. They began with racking up a tasty total through Michael Clarke's first ODI hundred against England; Clarke following up his ton at Old Trafford in the Test match. George Bailey also played an excellent innings, looking in superb touch and playing some enterprising strokes. Making 315 having been sent in was some effort and they defended it very comfortably.

44.2;W;McKay to Finn, OUT full on the stumps, Finn tries to clear the leg side again but picks out deep midwicket and that'll do nicely for Australia. Finn didn't nail this like his strikes in the previous over and couldn't clear the deep fielder, Adam Voges, who completed a comfortable catch and handed a third wicket to Clint McKay;Steven Finn c Voges b McKay 16 (36m 23b 1x4 1x6) SR: 69.56;

43.2;W;Fawad to Buttler, OUT goes again but this is straight up, Johnson goes back from mid-on a few yards and takes a comfortable catch. He's thumped a few nicely today Buttler but that was a total miscue that went a long way up off a top edge, trying again to swing away a ball floated up on the stumps. Good solid catch from Johnson;Jos Buttler c Johnson b Fawad Ahmed 75 (85m 65b 5x4 3x6) SR: 115.38;
43.1;4;Fawad to Buttler, FOUR runs step across the stumps and swings a flighted ball past mid-on, bit clunky but still got plenty of it;

39.3;4;Johnson to Buttler, FOUR runs full wide of off stump, Buttler leans across and just flicks it really but he's so powerful and he nails this wide of deep cover, quite a shot, managed to time it perfectly;
39.2;?;Johnson to Buttler, no run steps across the stumps to try and play the paddle over long leg who's up in the circle, misses and thankfully for him the ball misses off stump too;

38.6;6;Faulkner to Buttler, SIX runs another back of the hand delivery but this one Buttler sees early and whacks it off the stumps over midwicket, a long way back that's gone, great strike and a first ODI fifty for Jos Buttler, an innings he desperately needed;

36.3;W;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run, OUT and another, this straight and flicked into midwicket, they sprint back for two but oh dear Tredwell is pretty slow and has been run out that was very laboured, perhaps he wasn't expecting the second run but what seemed an easy two with deep midwicket having to run around the ball to get a return in to the bowler's end has produced a run out by a comfortable distance, very poor running indeed;James Tredwell run out (Clarke/Faulkner) 1 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
36.2;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run back of the hand slower ball around off stump, Buttler steps to leg and slaps it on the bounce to mid-off;

35.6;W;McKay to Stokes, OUT yet again slow, 65mph, pulled from outside off, nowhere near enough bat on it, comes off a top edge and flies straight down the throat of deep backward square leg. McKay has bowled several excellent slow deliveries and this has bagged him another wicket.

33.4;W;McKay to Morgan, OUT full outside off, tried to be swung over the leg side but it comes off a swirling outside edge that presents a chance to cover running back and Clarke clings on reaching over his shoulder.

He was aiming one of those whippy flicks over long-on but was through with the stroke a little soon and didn't escape the mistake;Eoin Morgan c Clarke b McKay 54 (99m 69b 4x4 0x6) SR: 78.26;
33.3;2;McKay to Morgan, 2 runs short outside off, slapped wide of long-on but not wide enough as the fielder is able to save four;

33.1;?;McKay to Buttler, no run length ball well outside off but Buttler can only dab it to point, McKay's loosener goes unpunished;

23.4;W;Voges to Bopara, OUT pushed back by Bopara, taken in his follow through by Voges and he's convinced this is caught and bowled... If so, it's a very soft dismissal. The umpires decide to check it, Bopara was just tapping down the ground, stopped in the shot and it came off the toe, Voges eased Morgan aside to take the catch and that will be out.

22.2;?;Watson to Bopara, no run short and over the stumps, Bopara gets out of the way;
22.1;W;Watson to Pietersen, OUT on the attack and he's picked out cover! Watson's golden arm has hit the jackpot, Pietersen departing for a sprightly 60 but England probably needed double that... It was a length ball in the channel, KP drove on the up, didn't come out of the middle - swished slightly across the line, actually - and flew to Faulkner's right, he tumbled and pouched it safely, as Watson roared out his approval;Kevin Pietersen c Faulkner b Watson 60 (95m 66b 6x4 2x6) SR: 90.9;

18.3;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run touch short, drops back and pushes into the covers;
18.2;4;Watson to Pietersen, FOUR runs well, this is extraordinary, a sort of walking ramp scoop shot, using the pace and getting right under it to send the ball high towards fine leg, where there's no man stationed, it plops a few yards in from the rope and then bounces for four;
18.1;?;Watson to Pietersen, no run good length, outside off, walks out and dabs short into the covers;

10.2;W;Faulkner to Root, OUT good length ball and straight through Root onto middle stump.

4.1;?;McKay to Pietersen, no run length ball two feet wide of off stump, left alone;
3.6;W;Johnson to Trott, OUT got him! Super delivery, back of a length, it bounced a little on Trott right on line and he nicked it through to Wade a cracking delivery from Johnson. An absolute beauty angled across Trott, it bounced on him, he couldn't get the bat out of the way and got a thick edge for a simple chance to Wade's right;Jonathan Trott c ?Wade b Johnson 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
3.6;1w;Johnson to Trott, 1 wide leg slip in straight away, bowled for the tuck to leg slip but got it too far down leg;
3.5;W;Johnson to Carberry, OUT back of a length a foot and a half wide of off stump, cut hard but cut straight to backward point for the simplest of chances.
