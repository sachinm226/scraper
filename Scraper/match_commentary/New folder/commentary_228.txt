Data
6.05pm From 92 for 4 in 20.1 overs, Australia finish at 324 for 8. New Zealand's bowling, especially at the slog overs was poor and their fielding was probably worse. Steven Smith led the way with the bat for the hosts, hitting 164 - the highest individual score at the SCG - and found able support from Travis Head, who made a half-century in his first ODI at home. Then Wade who was promoted ahead of Maxwell applied the finishing touches with drills and scoops. Be back in 30 minutes or thereabouts for the chase.
Asgar: "After 50 overs, NZ still have that review left which they did not use against Steve Smith!!! " ---- Had NZ activated their review when Smith was rapped on the pads by Boult, the Australia captain would have been dismissed for 14. At the start of the same over, he was dropped on 13 by Watling diving to his left
Must Hamid: "New Zealand Have NEVER Chased 300+ in Australia successfully till date.... "
49.6;?;Neesham to Zampa, no run wide yorker outside off, Zampa shuffles across, swishes, and is beaten. Very close to being called a wide;
49.5;2;Neesham to Zampa, 2 runs back of a length and outside off, punched in the air over the covers;
49.4;W;Neesham to Starc, OUT polite appeal for caught behind from Watling. Given out by umpire Martell. Did the brush the glove on its way? Or just the helmet? Starc challenges the on-field decision. Big bouncer on middle, the batsman was late on the hook. Grazes the top edge, then the helmet and then flies into the gloves of Watling down the leg side. Hotspot detects a white blotch on the bat and the helmet. Snicko picks up a spike too as the bat meets the ball;Mitchell Starc c ?Watling b Neesham 11 (6m 5b 2x4 0x6) SR: 220;
49.3;4;Neesham to Starc, FOUR runs 114.6ks, slower full delivery outside off, Starc picks it up and launches it straight down the ground. One-bounce four;

48.4;?;Henry to Wade, no run hacked down to mid-off off the inside half;

48.2;4;Henry to Wade, FOUR runs dug short and outside off, clubbed away over midwicket;
48.1;2;Henry to Wade, 2 runs someone finally nails a yorker, inside-edged behind square. Farcical fielding from NZ. The fielder at short fine leg collects the ball and has a wild throw, the ball goes towards cover (for a left-hander). Wade spots it, and aims for the second. Cummins isn't interested. The fielder at cover throws the ball at the non-striker's end, where Boult fumbles. Wade is safe and he collects two;

47.5;1;Boult to Wade, 1 run full on the stumps, hammered down the ground;

47.2;W;Boult to Smith, OUT Munro hangs onto a skier, Smith walks back to a standing ovation. Rousing reception for Smith from his home crowd. Williamson, Santner, and Guptill also congratulate Smith on his landmark. Back of a length and outside off, Smith has a hack at it, skews it in the air with the bottom hand flying off the bat. Munro was probably late again, he moves to his left from square leg and completes a diving catch at the midwicket region. Smith exits with 164, the highest individual ODI score at the SCG;Steven Smith c Munro b Boult 164 (206m 157b 14x4 4x6) SR: 104.45;
47.1;2;Boult to Smith, 2 runs very full on off, whipped away to wide long-on. Smith passes AB's 162, he is now has the highest ODI score at the SCG;

45.4;1;Boult to Smith, 1 run Munro was wrong-footed, he dives late to his right, and attempts the catch with both hands, and just finger-tips it away. Pretty full and just a shade outside off, whipped in the air, the ball just flew of the bat, and Munro messed it up. New Zealand's fielding has let them down today;
45.3;4;Boult to Smith, FOUR runs Smith celebrates his 150, and what a shot to bring up the landmark. Very full and angling away outside off, opens the face late and manipulates it very fine of short third man. This is now his best score in ODI cricket;

45.1;6;Boult to Smith, SIX runs massive six. Back of a length and outside off, pulled away into the stands beyond square leg;
44.6;6;Neesham to Wade, SIX runs this is even better. Wade scoops a six over fine leg. Follows the violent blows with finesse. Full toss on middle, Wade pre-meditated. Goes low and shovels it, Smith enjoyed that too. 21 runs off the over, and 52 runs off the last three overs;
44.5;6;Neesham to Wade, SIX runs and Wade sends Neesham into the stands beyond wide long-on now. Another slower one outside off, Wade hangs back and clobbers it away. 300 is definitely on;

43.5;6;Boult to Smith, SIX runs slower ball, picked up and dispatched. Buh-bye ball. 115ks offering on the pads, Smith spots it, and flicks it smartly over backward square leg for another six. Fine leg is inside the circle, and no protection in the deep;

20.1;W;Neesham to Smith, OUT gone! Marsh is run-out at the non-strikers end. Punches his bat in disgust. Full delivery on off, Smith drives it crisply and cleanly back at the bowler's right. Neesham mis-fields but gets his hands to the ball. It ricochets slightly but into the non-strikers stumps.

And that will be the end of Bailey. Quite a terrible delivery, full down leg. Bailey gets a little bit of bat on that, carries low to Watling's left who gets across and takes it with both hands.

Warner hangs his bat out, looking to get one down to third man. The ball takes the inside edge and hits the off stump. The second chop-on dismissal this afternoon. Another loose, lazy stroke.

Umer Khan: "Can't see what Australia see in Finch to persist with him despite his glaring problems of inconsistency and a dismal record against quality bowlers."
 Innings Start
10pm It was Smith's day at the SCG. He was reprieved on 13, and 152, and went on to rack up 164 - the highest individual score at this venue. His century and Head's half-century propelled Australia to 324 for 8 from 92 for 4. Smith then pulled off a scorching catch when he barely had any time to react to send back Watling.
Guptill's 11th ODI century, filled with trademark drives and lofts - lit up New Zealand's steep chase, but it fizzled out once Zampa struck twice in five balls. Cummins and Marsh then took care of the tail to seal a 68-run victory.
Kane Williamson, NZ captain: If we reflect back, we bowled poorly in the middle stage. A lot of credit should go to Steve. I think we were good in patches, and not so good in some, which left us a tall total to chase. Smith upped the ante with Head, and that sort of took the game away from us. We learnt a few lessons going into the next one. Guptill's was fantastic hundred - one of his better hundreds - and gave us a chance. It will be a quick turnaround for us.
Steven Smith, Australia captain and Man of the Match: I got a bit of luck. I was probably out lbw at one point. Nice to get my highest score at my home ground and post a huge total. I landed straight on my face [after taking the catch of Watling]. Have a sore jaw. Ones like that stick. We were able to get over the line, which was the most pleasing thing. Cummins was probably nervous at the start, nice to see him comeback and bowl with aggression. I am sure New Zealand will hit back hard.
Justin: "Good win to Australia but all is not lost for the visitors. NZ will enjoy Manuka Oval. Good pitch and small ground will make them feel right at home"
Vangmayj: "Munro has been disappointing. Just doesn't look comfortable in hitting boundaries which is supposed to be the reason he's in the team. Need better, more selfless innings than these if he wants to be a permanent fixture in this NZ team. "
Arjuna: "@Adarsh . Gillespie just said Starc and hazlewood will become the best new ball pair for Australia. I don't think he is underrated."
Otaku090: "Henry made 27 runs by hitting 4 fours and 1 six, while Munro made 47 hitting same number of boundaries. Interesting. "
That is all we have for you from this game. Thanks for tuning in. Looking forward to your company for the second ODI on Tuesday. Goodnight and cheers for now.

No signs of an inside edge. Umpire Dharmasena's finger goes up. The batsman reviews more out of hope rather than conviction. He has no hope at all. Horrid review.
