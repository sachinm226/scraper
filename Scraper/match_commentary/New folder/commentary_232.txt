5.50pm That England scorecard looks respectable only because of one man - Eoin Morgan. Starc had them 0 for 2 in this first three balls and they were 69 for 5 some time later because of Cummins and Faulkner. Morgan started slow to consolidate, pushed the run rate over four and then propelled them past 200 with some attractive strokes. 235 is set for Australia and we'll be back in about 40 mins.
Shekhar N: "@ SD, Morgan's innings is still a stellar one - scoring more than half of the team's total when nobody else could cross 30.. I am not sure how many times this has happened previously #AskSteven...."

 Innings Start
Time for the presentation:
Eoin Morgan: We did well to get to 234 after the early wickets, 250 would have been better. Ultimately the early wickets cost us. Starc swings the ball like Jimmy Anderson, so credit to him. We still won't know what a par score is if we look back, losing wickets throughout the innings cost us. I was happy with my performance to start like this as captain but devastated at the result. Woakes bowled well, Moeen Ali held his own as well. Looking forward to play India after four days.
Starc is the Man of the Match: To contribute to a win is always great and make Australia win is what we play for. The ball came out nicely and they got some partnerships in the middle but as a whole we bowled really really well. It's fantastic to see Warner bat like that, he's had a great summer and showed it tonight as well. There's healthy competition among the fast bowlers in the squad, everyone's looking for games and wickets in the tri-series and in the lead up to the World Cup.
George Bailey: Outstanding, and especially the start Starc gave us. He's coming down at really good pace and he can rip through the heart of a team. Cummins is coming along nicely as well and Johnson will be back with Hazlewood so we have some good pace. It's a challenging tri-series here. We were reasonably late to go for the bonus point, maybe in the Powerplay and Warner deserved to get his hundred. We made sure he got it and then went for the win, trying to make sure it didn't get messy.
That's all we have from the first match of the series. Join us again on Sunday for the Australia-India clash at the MCG - 2.20pm local time. Until then it's goodbye from Vishal Dikshit. Adi?s!
9.35pm What was going to be an easy win turned out to be stressful as Australia chased the bonus point. The target wasn't that steep on this pitch and Warner's hundred made sure they got there within 40 overs to start the series on a great note. What actually set it up for them was two wickets in the first three balls of the match from Mitchell Starc. It did go downhill from there, even though Eoin Morgan unleashed a fighting hundred that put up a respectable score for England.
