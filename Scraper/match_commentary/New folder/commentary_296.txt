So all it took was a couple of balls after tea and me nipping off to get some coffee. Australia have one long session to play and the new ball's been a pretty decent weapon even on this deck. Lets see what David Warner and Chris Rogers can do
144.6;W;Lyon to Rahat Ali, OUT oy, he's slogged a length ball straight down the throat of deep midwicket. This was a good length ball pushed across Rahat from around the wicket. Played a typical tailenders slog and is caught out in the deep;Rahat Ali c Rogers b Lyon 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
144.5;?;Lyon to Rahat Ali, no run good length ball on and around off stump, kept out awkwardly;
144.4;W;Lyon to Sarfaraz, OUT goes around the wicket and pushes this good length ball with the arm. Goes for a sweep and misses completely, Haddin whips the bails off in a flash and Sarfraz, having stretched too far forward, hasn't pushed his back leg to safety. Hammers his bat onto his pad in disappointment and that means it is tea Goes back to the dressing room who are all standing and gets a hug from Misbah;Sarfaraz Ahmed st ?Haddin b Lyon 109 (145m 105b 14x4 0x6) SR: 103.8;
144.3;1;Lyon to Babar, 1 run goes back and taps a good length ball towards third man. Babar's still not happy with that right hand of his;Zulfiqar Babar retired hurt 7 (24m 14b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50;
144.2;1;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 1 run gets to the length ball and sweeps it, not quite off the middle, to deep midwicket. Takes the single, if a little reluctantly;
144.1;2;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 2 runs runs down the track and whips it to the right of mid-on. Shows off his strong wrists and deep midwicket gets some work;
143.6;?;O'Keefe to Babar, no run fires in a low full toss on leg stump, which is tucked to midwicket;
143.5;?;O'Keefe to Babar, no run covers the line of a flighted ball and blocks;
143.4;4;O'Keefe to Babar, FOUR runs whack! gets to the flighted ball on the front foot and slaps it down the ground. What a strike, gets a pat on the back from Sarfraz;
143.3;?;O'Keefe to Babar, no run pushed through on off stump, Zulfiqar blocks and then shakes that hurt hand again. Looks like he isn't feeling at all comfortable out there. Pulls off the glove and has a chat with the umpire. While Clarke stretches his back too. More work for the Pakistan physio. A few painkillers popped in. Tea break round the corner. Stays at the crease though. Good man;
143.2;?;O'Keefe to Babar, no run tossed up on off stump, defended off the front foot;
143.1;?;O'Keefe to Babar, no run flighted on middle and leg, Zulfiqar plays a clip down the wrong line. Beaten;

142.2;?;Johnson to Babar, no run thuds into his right (non-bowling) hand and he is wringing it in pain. Drops his bat straight away after being hammered by a 143 kph, short ball on middle. Was barely in position to play the ball there and his middle finger is bleeding. Physio comes out immediately to put some tape on the bruised finger;
142.1;1;Johnson to Sarfaraz, 1 run shortish and outside off, Sarfraz chops it to deep point and takes the single first ball. Australia wouldn't mind that;

87.1;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run tossed up outside off, Misbah has lunged forward to nudge it towards midwicket. Turns a little too much for it and is struck on the front pad. Impact was outside off though and ruins the appeal;

140.6;?;Johnson to Sarfaraz, no run full and outside off, Sarfraz slices it into the gully region which is quite well populated;
140.5;?;Johnson to Sarfaraz, no run fishes outside off and is beaten again. This was a back of a length delivery at 144 kph, straightens just enough to beat the edge.;
140.4;?;Johnson to Sarfaraz, no run full and wide outside off, Sarfraz slices it to gully;
140.3;?;Johnson to Sarfaraz, no run lands a wide yorker, just about right, and beats Sarfraz' slice towards third man;
140.2;?;Johnson to Sarfaraz, no run full and wide outside off, seemed quite slow too. And it was, 126 kph, Sarfraz won't bit;
140.1;?;Johnson to Sarfaraz, no run full and a touch outside off, Sarfraz blocks towards point;
85.6;2b;Lyon to Misbah, 2 byes looped up around off stump, he goes for a sweep but mistimes it. So much that he misses the shot. Couple of byes though;
85.5;1;Lyon to Shafiq, 1 run nips down the track and gets himself in trouble as he tries to turn this good length ball behind square leg and it falls just short of the man there;
85.4;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run good length ball ducks in off a good length and strikes him on the front pad. Some dust popping up off the turf from this delivery. Too much turn though;
85.3;3lb;Lyon to Misbah, 3 leg byes no leg slip, and Misbah has tickled the ball around the corner for three runs. No need for Australia to have their hands on their heads though, no bat involved;

83.6;?;Siddle to Misbah, no run good length ball outside off, Misbah gets forward and lifts his bat skyward;

82.1;?;Johnson to Shafiq, no run full and a few inches outside off stump, Shafiq shoulders arms;
81.6;?;Siddle to Misbah, no run banged in short, seems to deflect off his back and away to the keeper. Siddle appeals, possibly for leg before? Won't be getting that;

81.1;1;Siddle to Misbah, 1 run full on middle, Misbah settles into a forward defensive and gets an inside edge towards square leg. Played down the wrong line there;
80.6;?;Johnson to Shafiq, no run fuller and outside off, Shafiq doesn't want to chase it;

80.4;?;Johnson to Shafiq, no run back of a good length and outside off, Shafiq shoulders arms. Just a shade of inward dip there;
80.3;?;Johnson to Shafiq, no run fullish and outside off, refuses to play;
80.2;W;Johnson to Younis, OUT he's struck again! Johnson has a knack of keeping any game alive. This jagged back in, that movement surprised Younis and the pace was too quick for him, at least judging by how late he brought the bat down from that high backlift. Struck on the top flap of the back pad. The on-field up gave it out, Younis went for a review. Three reds is the reply. Brilliant innings comes to an end off a brilliant ball. Walks off with his bat raised and to generous applause. First Pakistani to hit centuries against all Test-playing nations, by the way;Younis Khan lbw b Johnson 106 (312m 223b 10x4 1x6) SR: 47.53;
80.1;?;Johnson to Younis, no run bowls a wide yorker first up, that ducks back in after pitching.;

79.3;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run tossed up well outside off, Younis sweeps powerfully to deep square leg;
79.2;6;Lyon to Younis, SIX runs jumps down the track and pummels a six over long-on. Into the second tier! Younis gets a bear hug from his captain. What an innings, he's been the saviour for Pakistan so many times and he does it again. 25th Test ton. Equals Inzy's record;

78.6;?;Smith to Misbah, no run full toss on leg stump, Misbah taps it down to mid-on;

76.4;1;O'Keefe to Misbah, 1 run pushes a tossed up ball to the right of cover and races off to the other end. Good placement;
76.3;?;O'Keefe to Misbah, no run defends a flighted ball on middle;
76.2;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run meets a full toss with a full-blooded sweep and finds deep square leg;
76.1;4;O'Keefe to Younis, FOUR runs lifts this handsomely to the long-on boundary. Lovely footwork as he jumps down the track and hits through the line. Gorgeous stroke;

75.5;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run full toss on and around middle, Younis sweeps through to deep square leg. He's brought that stroke out a lot more regularly in this session;

73.5;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run goes back and cuts a shortish ball outside off;
73.4;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run goes back and punches a good length ball, seeking a single to long-on, but Lyon runs to his right and parries to away for short midwicket;
73.3;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run big appeal from Australia, they think this has come off the glove as he goes for a sweep. Clarke has a chat with his bowler and goes upstairs for a second opinion. Good length ball with just a little bit of turn to beat Misbah's shot, it seems to have come off the wristband and not the glove. That's a top call from umpire Kettleborough;
73.2;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run gets across outside off and defends a flighted delivery;
73.1;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run flighted and outside off, defended calmly;
72.6;?;Johnson to Younis, no run back of a length on off stump, defended;

72.3;?;Johnson to Younis, no run 133kph, full and wide outside off, Younis won't be lured into playing;
72.2;?;Johnson to Younis, no run batting outside his crease he punches a shortish ball to short cover. This was at 147 kph. So much for me thinking he's tired in this session;

70.5;?;Johnson to Younis, no run tries a bouncer on middle and leg at 143 kph, Younis sinks below it. Mitch tests his left ankle as he walks back to his mark. Alex Kountouris seems to be on stand-by in the dressing room. Mitch spent quite a while checking the landing area in the crease in this innings;
70.4;?;Johnson to Younis, no run gets across on off stump to defend a good length ball that clocks at 140 kph;
70.3;?;Johnson to Younis, no run good length and pushing away outside off, doesn't bother with it;
70.2;?;Johnson to Younis, no run a bit of excitement there and the umpires come together to check, but I think this was a bump ball. This was a full toss outside off, the batsman looks to slice it away and gets an outside edge, that is drilled into the ground before reaching Clarke at second slip. Why would then want to go up for that? Unless they hadn't been watching...;
70.1;?;Johnson to Younis, no run back of a length and outside off at 137 kph, punched to mid-off;
69.6;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run tries to force a flighted delivery outside off stump through the extra cover region, doesn't time it well though;
69.5;1;Lyon to Misbah, 1 run ooooh, Misbah! He's lined up a length ball and launched it straight over Lyon's head. But the bowler has done well. He held the ball back just enough to make sure Misbah mistimed the stroke.;
69.4;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run gets forward to drive a flighted ball outside off and slices it to point;
69.3;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run length ball on off stump, tapped down to mid-off;

67.4;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run tossed up outside off, swept all along the turf to deep square leg;
67.3;?;Lyon to Younis, no run this one gets a little rip off the deck, but Younis has lunged forward and across and deadens it. Silly point might be in order;

66.4;1;O'Keefe to Misbah, 1 run and there's Misbah's guilty pleasure, goes for a reverse sweep and makes it dribble away past the wicketkeeper;
66.3;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run gets back to block a good length ball;
66.2;4;O'Keefe to Younis, FOUR runs it's surprising that he's used that shot so little. Lunges forward and a flighted ball and sweeps it powerfully to the deep square leg boundary. And despite the best efforts of Lyon, it gets the rope;
66.1;?;O'Keefe to Younis, no run tossed up on the pads, Younis stamps down on it with a dead bat;
65.6;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run stays back to a good length ball on off stump and keeps it out;

65.2;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run flighted just outside off, Misbah smothers it;
65.1;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run goes back and whips a length ball through to square leg. His wristwork has been impressive this innings. Just as much as his footwork;
64.6;?;O'Keefe to Misbah, no run flighted on off stump and drives to mid-off;
64.5;?;O'Keefe to Misbah, no run a little more bounce this time but Misbah controls it well as he backs away and cracks it towards backward point;

63.2;?;Lyon to Younis, no run tossed up outside off, defended;
63.1;4;Lyon to Younis, FOUR runs hello! That's a stunning strike from Younis, especially in light of the cricket today. Gets down the track and unleashes on a flighted ball outside off. Collects a boundary to the long-on boundary. Free swing of the arms;

61.5;?;Marsh to Younis, no run a shade shortish on off stump, Younis blocks from the crease;

61.3;1;Marsh to Misbah, 1 run back of a length and outside off, taps a way through into the covers and they go through for a quick single despite a bit of hesitation. Get together for a little conversation mid-pitch to sort out their frequency troubles;
61.2;2;Marsh to Misbah, 2 runs but Misbah trumps them all as he plays late and tucks a full, inswinging delivery through the gap at midwicket;
61.1;1;Marsh to Younis, 1 run full and slipping down leg, Younis clips it uppishly behind square leg.;
60.6;?;Siddle to Misbah, no run good length ball outside off, not bothered with;
60.5;?;Siddle to Misbah, no run it's not just Mitch who roughs up the batsmen. Here's Siddle digging in a short ball and Misbah takes his eyes off it and gets into a crouch, struck on the shoulder and the ball balloons over towards point;
60.4;?;Siddle to Misbah, no run good length ball around the off stump, defended with soft hands;
60.3;1;Siddle to Younis, 1 run back of a length and outside off, this one seems to nip away from the bat and Younis has to reach out and tap it towards point;
60.2;?;Siddle to Younis, no run oooh, they almost pulled a dismissal out of the hat. They've been teasing the batsman into playing the flick with all these fuller balls curling in. this is another of that variety and it almost carries to short mdiwicket;

52.5;W;Johnson to Azhar Ali, OUT he's struck! Azhar's laziness has sneaked through and he has to depart. Teases him with a fuller ball outside off and gets the uppish drive in reply. Doolan is at short cover and snaffles up a simple catch. Vents his frustration by slamming the bat down on the turf;Azhar Ali c Doolan b Johnson 53 (211m 167b 6x4 0x6) SR: 31.73;

 Innings Start
Australia losing 10 for 175 then, after the 128-run opening partnership. Pakistan's inexperienced attack has done superbly to give their side a 151-run lead. Six wickets for the spinners, three for the debutant leggie Yasir Shah. The opening came via Rahat Ali, who removed Chris Rogers and then ran out Alex Doolan. Third successive hundred for David Warner but very little from the middle order before Johnson chipped in with 37.
Pakistan will have about 15 overs to bat this evening. They will want to bat at least two sessions and a bit tomorrow, but for now, will have to avoid losing wickets today.

Hafeez back
 Innings Start
Generous applause, from both his captain and the opposition captain. It's been a serene innings, despite the calls for upping the run-rate. And yet he didn't ignore them either. Used his sweeps and reverse sweeps to collect his boundaries. Then dabbed and tucked and ticked off the singles to savour yet another century. Not too many can lay claim to scoring two in a Test. More than his own record though, he's put Pakistan in an immensely powerful position to claim this Test
77.6;4;O'Keefe to Younis, FOUR runs that's the Pakistan record! 26th Test ton, and it's two tons in the same Test. Against Australia too. Comes off a powerful sweep, all along the ground to the square leg boundary. That is also Pakistan's declaration!;
77.5;?;O'Keefe to Younis, no run tossed up on the pads, nudged away behind square leg, but there's a man there as well;
77.4;?;O'Keefe to Younis, no run this is a good length ball on off stump, defended under his eyes;
77.3;?;O'Keefe to Younis, no run and that means that tap into the point doesn't fetch him the single he needs;
77.2;1;O'Keefe to Sarfaraz, 1 run shortish and a shade outside off, tapped away through the covers;
77.1;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run that's a top edge, Younis' sweep, for once, is mistimed. He had to drag it from well outside off and there wasn't too much pace behind this either. Two seemed likely, but Mitch had thundered in at the ball from fine leg;
76.6;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run goes back to a flatter ball and taps it through to deep midwicket to retain strike;
76.5;1;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 1 run tossed up and Sarfraz gets to it on the full and drives to long-off;
76.4;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run a tough shorter and outside off, Younis pulls through to deep long-on;
76.3;1;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 1 run think this was a legspinner from Lyon, Sarfraz clips it away through midwicket;
76.2;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run on the pads again he tucks it through midwicket;
76.1;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run tossed up on the pads, Younis tucks it away behind square leg;
75.6;2;O'Keefe to Sarfaraz, 2 runs a touch shortish and outside off, Sarfraz taps it away behind point for a couple of runs;
75.5;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run this held up in the pitch and Younis was into his cut a touch too quickly. Checks his stroke, but still the lob fell dangerously close to point;
75.4;6;O'Keefe to Younis, SIX runs this time it's pure, brutal power as he takes a length ball and mauls it over cow corner. That hundred is racing towards him. And it will be his second of the match;
75.3;2;O'Keefe to Younis, 2 runs sweeps a flighted delivery from middle to deep square leg. All along the ground;
75.2;1;O'Keefe to Sarfaraz, 1 run stays back to a good length ball on middle, tapped away towards point in hopes of a single;

74.4;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run tossed up on off stump, nudged towards short midwicket;
74.3;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run another reverse sweep, but this ball was a touch quicker and flatter and outside leg too. Struggled to connect, but managed to do so towards point;
74.2;4;Lyon to Younis, FOUR runs that's lovely work from Younis. Big stride forward and meets it with a delicate reverse sweep. Only wanted to give it direction and he has got it fine enough to beat third man;
74.1;1;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 1 run keeps to his crease against a flatter ball on middle and clips it through to deep midwicket;
73.6;?;O'Keefe to Younis, no run tossed up on off stump, Younis drives it into the covers;
73.5;2;O'Keefe to Younis, 2 runs drags a flighted ball from outside off and sweeps it powerfully to deep midwicket;
73.4;1;O'Keefe to Sarfaraz, 1 run eased through the covers for a jogged single to deep cover;
73.3;?;O'Keefe to Sarfaraz, no run tossed up just outside off, Sarfraz opens the face towards point;
73.2;2;O'Keefe to Sarfaraz, 2 runs looped up well outside off, Sarfraz lunges forward and sweeps to deep square leg;
73.1;2;O'Keefe to Sarfaraz, 2 runs this claims the outside edge as Sarfraz goes for a forceful drive through point, but gets it a lot finer than he intended;
72.6;1;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 1 run whipped away behind square as Lyon targets the pads;
72.5;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run lunges forward to try and tuck this good length ball through the leg side, only manages a bit of a leading edge;
72.4;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run leans into a drive through the covers as Lyon keeps flightede the ball outside off, from around the wicket;
72.3;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run conventional sweep this time as he finds deep midwicket;
72.2;?;Lyon to Younis, no run tossed up on middle and leg, Younis decides to reverse sweep. Doesn't quite connect properly and the ball bounces just before Clarke at point;
72.1;?;Lyon to Younis, no run goes back to a fuller ball in an effort to clip it through midwicket. But the length wasn't there;
71.6;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run it's short now and Younis jumps back and pulls so hard he is nearly off balance. There is protection there now though;
71.5;4;O'Keefe to Younis, FOUR runs this was looped in on leg stump, Younis has pummeled a slog sweep into the deep midwicket boundary.;
71.4;1;O'Keefe to Sarfaraz, 1 run tossed up on off stump, Sarfraz drives through the covers to get off the mark;
71.3;W;O'Keefe to Shehzad, OUT oh, has he been struck in front?! The umpire reckons so, but Shehzad goes for a review. This was a nicely flighted delivery, pitching on off and keeping its line. The batsman went for a reverse sweep in hopes of upping the ante, but seems to be struck in front of off stump. Hawk Eye confirms it and says umpire's call with respect to the ball going on and hitting the stumps;Ahmed Shehzad lbw b O'Keefe 131 (292m 233b 10x4 4x6) SR: 56.22;
71.3;1w;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 wide flighted, but the direction is awful, as it skates away well outside off stump;
71.2;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run nips down the track to a good length ball and taps it to short cover;
71.1;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run loads of flight on off stump, Younis spots an opportunity as he dabs it in front of cover with soft hands and sneaks a single;
70.6;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run a little shortish this time and Younis half-sweeps and half-pulls it through to deep square leg;
70.5;2;Lyon to Younis, 2 runs tossed up on middle and off, Younis pulls out a reverse sweep and makes sure that goes all along the ground too;
70.4;?;Lyon to Younis, no run;
70.3;1;Lyon to Shehzad, 1 run jumps down the track to thump a flighted ball straight down the ground. Dominant stroke, but after hitting it, he grabs at his right leg. Seems to be cramps.;
70.2;?;Lyon to Shehzad, no run a little too full for that back-foot loft over the covers, which is why he misses it outside off;
70.1;2;Lyon to Shehzad, 2 runs a little width on offer and Shehzad backs away to cut behind point;
69.6;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run goes back and tucks a length ball off his pads through square leg;

69.4;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run goes back to a short ball on off stump and taps it down to long-off;
69.3;2;O'Keefe to Younis, 2 runs tossed up on middle, a little slower though, which dupes Younis as he plays a sweep. Gets a top edge and it lobs over the keeper;
69.2;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run slider on middle and leg, Shehzad tickles it towards fine leg;
69.1;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run pushed through on off stump, punches it to short cover;
68.6;1;Lyon to Shehzad, 1 run clips, a little uppishly, but wide of short midwicket much to the chagrin for the man who yelled "catch";
68.5;?;Lyon to Shehzad, no run nips down the track to a flighted ball outside off and drives back at the bowler;
68.4;?;Lyon to Shehzad, no run goes back to a good length ball on off stump and tucks it to short leg;

68.1;1;Lyon to Shehzad, 1 run goes back to a good length ball and clips it to deep square leg;
67.6;2;Siddle to Younis, 2 runs short and aimed at the body, Younis is up off his toes, he does that a lot, and rolls his wrists on top of the bounce, he does that a lot too, and finds a couple to deep fine leg;
67.5;?;Siddle to Younis, no run gets down the track to an eventually shortish ball outside off and taps it towards point;
67.4;1;Siddle to Shehzad, 1 run low full toss on off stump, Shehzhad taps it back down to long-on;
67.3;?;Siddle to Shehzad, no run full and outside off, Shehzad leans into a drive but finds cover;

67.1;?;Siddle to Younis, no run back of a length and on the off stump, punched into the covers;
66.6;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run length ball, sizes it up and sweeps it to deep square leg. Gee, he's good with that shot. Full swing of the arms;

66.2;1;Lyon to Younis, 1 run tossed up a little more on the stumps, Younis keeps to this crease and tucks it away behind square leg;
66.1;2;Lyon to Younis, 2 runs flatter delivery on the pads, Younis whips it away quite extravagantly through towards deep square leg;
65.6;?;Siddle to Shehzad, no run goes for another short ball, Shehzad sways away from it and looks to ramp it over the keeper. But doesn't pull it off;
65.5;6;Siddle to Shehzad, SIX runs another overpitched delivery on the stumps, another violent strike down the ground. This is another emphatic strike from Shehzad. He's definitely been freed after reaching that century;
65.5;1w;Siddle to Shehzad, 1 wide banged into the middle of the pitch and it soars over Shehzad's head. Too wide, even by Test match standards;
65.4;6;Siddle to Shehzad, SIX runs whther he likes it or not, Siddle is going for a few! Pushes a middle stump half-volley and Shezhad launches him over wide long-on.;
65.3;4;Siddle to Shehzad, FOUR runs length ball on off stump, Shehzad slaps it down the ground with pure disdain. Big fast bowler's not going to like that;
65.2;3;Siddle to Younis, 3 runs that's deftly stroked to the left of mid-off. The ball was a little too full and Younis simply hit through the line. Lovely stroke. Marsh chases after it, almost wilting in the heat in Dubai. But he pulls it back;
65.1;?;Siddle to Younis, no run back of a length and outside off, Younis slices it towards point;
64.6;4;Johnson to Shehzad, FOUR runs dug in short and seeking the helmet, Shehzad goes for the pull. Doesn't connect it properly though. Skews away towards the square leg boundary. Slow pitch, shmoe pitch. A Johnson short ball is still never a pleasant experience;
64.5;?;Johnson to Shehzad, no run 143kph, full and wide outside off, no need to bother with that;
64.4;?;Johnson to Shehzad, no run back of a length on middle and leg, Shehzad defends as he opens himself up to get behind the line better;
64.3;?;Johnson to Shehzad, no run full and wide outside off, Shehzad will not play at that;
64.2;?;Johnson to Shehzad, no run banged in short as he moves around the wicket, Shehzad ducks under it though;
64.1;1;Johnson to Younis, 1 run fuller and moving across the right-hander, Younis steers it behind point with far better control after two plays and misses in the last Mitch over;
63.6;4;Siddle to Shehzad, FOUR runs a calm push down the ground that belies any sense of nerves - although there were there, he kept walking to square leg to keep himself in check. Lovely looking stroke as he shuffled in line and caressed a fuller ball down the ground for the two he needed;
63.5;?;Siddle to Shehzad, no run fuller ball on and around off stump, Shehzhad punches it back at the bowler;
63.4;?;Siddle to Shehzad, no run short of a good length and outside off, Shehzad gets across to it and blocks;

62.3;?;Johnson to Younis, no run full and slanted across the right-hander, Younis is lured into a drive on the up and misses;
62.2;2;Johnson to Younis, 2 runs moves back over the wicket now but his short balls are still perfectly on target. This was 148 kph too, but Younis has done wonderfully well to absorb all that pace and tuck it behind square leg. And he has made it through for a couple too;
62.1;1;Johnson to Shehzad, 1 run shortish with a little width on offer, chopped through to the sweeper on the off side boundary;
61.6;?;Marsh to Younis, no run fuller on off stump, capably kept out by Younis;
61.5;3;Marsh to Shehzad, 3 runs backs away to a shortish delivery and he's cracked it through the gap in the covers. Terrific timing;
61.4;?;Marsh to Shehzad, no run targets the pads again, clips to midwicket;
61.3;?;Marsh to Shehzad, no run full and slid a bit too far down the leg side for Shehzad to reach with his flick;
61.2;?;Marsh to Shehzad, no run shortish on off stump, runs it down to a fly slip;
61.1;4;Marsh to Shehzad, FOUR runs if it is, you should like this shot! Picks up a length ball and wallops it down the ground to the long-off boundary. Pakistan had had a little drinks break before the start of the over. Guess it was more a message being sent out;
60.6;?;Johnson to Younis, no run full and slanted in on off stump, pushed towards mid-off;
60.5;?;Johnson to Younis, no run fuller and outside off, sliced away towards point;
60.4;?;Johnson to Younis, no run good length ball on middle and off. Defended carefully;

60.2;?;Johnson to Younis, no run gets up off his toes to tuck a shortish ball towards short midwicket;
60.1;?;Johnson to Younis, no run makes him hop with a short ball on off stump, Younis controls it well though;
59.6;?;Marsh to Shehzad, no run gets up tall and outside off, tapped into the off side as he gets up on his toes;
59.5;?;Marsh to Shehzad, no run shortish and outside off, Shehzad wanted to crack it through the off side and then checks his stroke towards point;
59.4;1;Marsh to Younis, 1 run fullish and a shade outside off, Younis taps into the covers and sets off. Good call, Shehzad responds. Nicely done;

59.2;?;Marsh to Younis, no run slides a good length ball down the leg side, can't get his flick to connect;

58.6;1;Johnson to Younis, 1 run 141kph, full and outside off, driven towards mid-off and he retains strike. Seems to be drinks;

58.1;?;Johnson to Younis, no run 138kph, fullish on middle, Younis keeps to his crease to defend;
57.6;?;Marsh to Shehzad, no run back of a length and outside off, defended a bit away from his body;
57.5;4;Marsh to Shehzad, FOUR runs full toss on leg stump, that's a simple putaway. Shehzad uses his wrists to send it scurrying past the right of mid-on. Into the nineties;
57.4;?;Marsh to Shehzad, no run fuller and outside off, Shehzad is confidently forward to a push into the covers;
57.3;?;Marsh to Shehzad, no run good length ball just outside off, defended carefully;

56.4;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run tossed up outside leg, Shehzad clears the front leg to defend and gets a bit of an outside edge past the right of slip;
56.3;6;O'Keefe to Shehzad, SIX runs gorgeous stroke! He's added a little more oomph into this stroke and it shows as the ball sails over the long-on boundary. Not enough spin to worry Shezhad as he hits clean through the line of a flatter ball outside leg. Excellent use of the feet;
56.2;2;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 2 runs gets down with a sweep this time and powers it away behind square leg. Hit a little too hard to get enough timing on it;
56.1;4;O'Keefe to Shehzad, FOUR runs they don't like this leg stump line one bit. This time it is Shehzad who runs at the bowler, gets to the pitch and slams it over long-on's head;
55.6;1;Marsh to Shehzad, 1 run short ball, doesn't get up and Shehzad short-arm pulls it to deep square leg.;

55.4;1;Marsh to Younis, 1 run full and tailing in late, not enough to worry Younis though as he pushes to mid-on to tick the lead over to 300;
55.3;?;Marsh to Younis, no run full and outside off, driven to mid-off off the front foot;
55.2;?;Marsh to Younis, no run just short of a good length and it seems to straighten. Younis covers it off the back foot and blocks to mid-on;
55.1;?;Marsh to Younis, no run full toss outside off, another loosener to start his spell, Younis can't take advantage though as he mistimes a push to the covers;
54.6;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run driven to long-on and he will keep strike;
54.5;4;O'Keefe to Younis, FOUR runs runs down the track, makes loads of room and lifts a good length ball over long-off. Wonderful shot. Very fluent;
54.4;?;O'Keefe to Younis, no run tossed up seeking the rough outside leg, but there's a bit too much flight. Misses the debris and it's calmly tucked away to short fine leg;
54.3;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run tucked off his hips into the midwicket region;
54.2;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run looks to hit this good length ball hard on first thought, then he checks his stroke. Lobs back at the bowler;
54.1;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run gets down the track, but O'Keefe beats him in flight. Refuses to give him the loft he wants and the batsman has to settle for a push to mid-off;
53.6;?;Siddle to Younis, no run neatly driven into the covers, leaning into a full and wide delivery outside off;
53.5;1;Siddle to Shehzad, 1 run good length and outside off, punched off the front foot through the covers;

53.1;?;Siddle to Shehzad, no run back of a length and outside off, defended stoutly;
52.6;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run looks much better when he comes down the track to the pitch of a flighted ball outside leg and drives to mid-off;
52.5;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run tossed up outside leg stump, Shehzad goes for a sweep. Doesn't look to comfortable playing that shot though as it dribbles off the pad and wanders away rather close to leg stump;
52.4;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run nips down the track, but having seen the ball wasn't there to get under, he blocks;
52.3;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run goes back to a fuller ball and taps it into the leg side;
52.2;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run backs away to a good length ball that hits the rough. Turns and bounces, but it is slow enough for the batsman to adjust and tap into the covers;
52.1;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run tossed up outside leg stump, defended;
51.6;?;Siddle to Younis, no run beats the batsman with a little inward drift. Younis was on the flick but the ball skidded on a touch too quickly for him and he was left playing outside the line and was struck on the pads;

51.4;?;Siddle to Younis, no run fullish and angled in on off stump at 139kph, defended;

50.5;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run goes back to work a good length ball through midwicket, but this turns a bit more and takes the leading edge. But falls well to the left of the bowler;
50.4;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run flighted on middle and leg, defended as he keeps the front leg away;
50.3;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run pushed through a touch shorter on leg, tapped away through midwicket;
50.2;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run tossed up outside off, he taps it down to long-off;
50.1;2;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 2 runs this is swirling, Marsh was running back, he had to track it over his shoulder. Always a tough chance and Shehzhad has managed to put enough power into a down-the-track loft to make sure the ball lobs over the fielder;
49.6;?;Siddle to Younis, no run another one that keeps low. This was good length and outside off, Younis again leaps up while playing away from his body and gets an inside edge;
49.5;?;Siddle to Younis, no run back of a length and outside off, Younis jumps up needlessly and seems to have sabotaged his own shot. The cut shot ends up getting an inside edge right off the toe of the bat to the keeper;
49.4;?;Siddle to Younis, no run fullish and slanted on middle, Younis is far more confidently behind it;
49.3;?;Siddle to Younis, no run good length ball that ducks in off the pitch to cramp Younis up. The lbw appeal is for bat hitting pad before the bat, keeper went up straight away, bowler followed a touch late. Umpire disagrees. Discussion between captain and bowler and we go for a review. It is pad first, and the batsman hadn't moved too far across on off stump. Hawk-Eye says the impact was outside off and that means the umpire's decision will be confirmed;
49.2;?;Siddle to Younis, no run fullish and a shade outside off, Younis covers it and blocks;
49.1;?;Siddle to Younis, no run full on off stump, Younis gets forward and drills it to mid-on. Good punch;

47.6;?;Siddle to Younis, no run back of a length and outside off, tapped into the covers;
47.5;?;Siddle to Younis, no run gets the ball to dart away just enough to have Younis in a spot of bother. It was wide enough to be left alone, but this is Pakistan looking for runs and so he tries a run to third man and is beaten;
47.4;?;Siddle to Younis, no run good length ball a shade outside off, Younis shuffles across to try and defends towards midwicket;
47.3;?;Siddle to Younis, no run shortish and outside off again, Younis looks to slap it through the covers and gets it off the inside edge again;
47.2;?;Siddle to Younis, no run fuller delivery with a little nip in off the deck, gets an inside edge onto his thigh pad;
47.1;?;Siddle to Younis, no run back of a length and outside off, he was leaving those more often than not, this time though he looks to crack it through extra. Sought to hit it too hard and only manages an inside edge;
46.6;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run defends a tossed up delivery on middle and off;
46.5;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run flighted on leg stump, with a touch more bounce it would seem. Hits a little higher on the bat as he pushes to mid-off;
46.4;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run tossed up on leg stump, defended calmly;
46.3;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run goes back to a flatter ball and taps it through into the midwicket region again. O'Keefe's looking to target the rough outside the right-hander's leg stump.... or trying to stymie the batsman;
46.2;2;O'Keefe to Younis, 2 runs tossed up on the pads, Younis drops it into the midwicket region, sort of at the mid-point between short leg and the man in the deep and they stole two!;
46.1;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run tossed up just outside off, driven smartly to mid-off as he uses his feet to give him the room to bring down a straight bat;
45.6;?;Siddle to Younis, no run a little bit of width on offer and its been sliced away towards third man;
45.5;?;Siddle to Younis, no run a little shape away and Younis covers it quite well. Nice, full length from Siddle;
45.4;?;Siddle to Younis, no run back of a length and outside off, Younis is happy to see it off to the keeper;
45.3;?;Siddle to Younis, no run good length ball, and judging by the batsman crouching after the shot, kept a touch low. Defended well enough;
45.2;4;Siddle to Younis, FOUR runs looks like they've been given some stern instructions during the break. Then again this was a leg-stump half volley. Younis pulls out a brilliantly whip through square leg. Terrific stroke;
45.1;?;Siddle to Younis, no run fullish on off stump, Younis gets on his front foot and blocks;
44.6;6;O'Keefe to Shehzad, SIX runs that's length, that should always be swatted away and Shehzad doesn't disappoint. Runs at the bowler to make it a touch more emphatic and launches it straight over the bowler's head. The tailender in me roars in delight;
44.5;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run tossed up on leg stump, bunted back at the bowler;
44.4;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run this is flighted above the eye-line and Younis resorts to his slog sweep to deep square leg;
44.3;?;O'Keefe to Younis, no run watches this good length ball carefully enough to keep to his crease and turn it away behind square leg;
44.2;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run goes back this time as he sees a flatter ball and taps it through the same extra cover area;
44.1;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run nips down the track to get to the pitch of this O'Keefe delivery and taps it towards extra cover;
43.6;?;Lyon to Younis, no run pushed through on middle, kept out easily. That will be lunch;
43.5;?;Lyon to Younis, no run moves around the wicket to target the stumps, Shehzad's straight bat ensures that mission is unsuccessful;
43.4;1;Lyon to Shehzad, 1 run goes back and uses his wrists to turn a good length ball to the left of leg slip;

43.1;6;Lyon to Younis, SIX runs heaves a good length ball away over the long-on boundary! That's a Misbah-like shot, just decides he wants all of this delivery tossed up outside off and creams it.;

42.1;?;O'Keefe to Younis, no run tossed up outside off, Younis gets his front foot to the pitch and defends;
41.6;?;Johnson to Shehzad, no run 138kph, that's a slower ball, quite wide of off stump, left alone;
41.5;?;Johnson to Shehzad, no run banged in short, but again this one doesn't rise too much. Shehzad does well to sink under that;
41.4;?;Johnson to Shehzad, no run good length ball outside off, coaxes a little seam away as well, Shehzad doesn't play;
41.3;1;Johnson to Younis, 1 run shortish on middle and leg, Younis tucks it through midwicket;
41.2;2;Johnson to Younis, 2 runs good reply from Younis as he reaches a fuller delivery outside off and crisply drills it through in front of cover. Top shot;

38.2;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run nips down the track and pushes the ball down towards mid-off and sets off straight away, Younis doesn't oblige. Has to put on the breaks, whirl around and get back to his crease. Warner's throw from mid-off hits him, but he did not deviate from his path with the intention to obstruct the throw;
38.1;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run tossed up on middle, Younis sweeps it behind square leg. A go-to shot;

37.5;?;Johnson to Shehzad, no run 147kph, dug in short and it forced this deck to offer just enough help to rise up and have Shehzad in considerable bother.

36.5;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run nips down the track and drives along the ground to that mid-off fielder to bring up his half-century. Team-mates stand up in appreciation, so does a more populated Dubai stadium;

36.1;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run that was hit a little uppishly, but mid-off is rather deep and he knows it. Opens the face as he gets down to the pitch of the ball to make sure mid-off had to rush to his right;

34.3;1;O'Keefe to Shehzad, 1 run that's a lovely shot, ran down to the pitch of a flighted ball and drives to long-off. O'Keefe doesn't normally get too much turn and Pakistan know that. Again, Smith follows the batsman again;
34.2;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run tossed up on off stump, defended casually;
34.1;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run nips down but O'Keefe first it in on off stump, Younis can only smother it between bat and pad. Steve Smith is following the batsman, even as he runs down the track, from silly point;
33.6;3;Marsh to Shehzad, 3 runs gets up tall behind a shortish ball outside off and smokes it through the covers. The outfield is a little slow though and that means this will only be three;

32.2;?;O'Keefe to Shehzad, no run nips down the track towards the pitch of a good length ball and pushes back at the bowler;
32.1;1;O'Keefe to Younis, 1 run tossed up outside off, Younis says he's have some of it with a sweep, all along the ground to deep square leg;

Glenn: "@ Lyon Doubters. What does Lyon have to do to get support. His strike rate is marginally behind Herath, HIs average is slightly behind Herath, but for some reason one is a an attacker and the other is defensive? And he also bowls in a pace dominated team where they get most of the wickets... yet he does well. The monkey will always be on his back even if he gets over 200 test wickets! He is not Warne... can we move past that?" Point is, would you be scared of Lyon or Herath if you were batting out there?
 Innings Start
That's all we've got for you. Do stick around for the post-match quotes, analyses and videos that are bound to pour in on the site. And there's a second Test to play too, at Abu Dhabi on Thursday. So do join us then. For now, this is Alagappan Muthu, and Vekat Raghav saying sayonara
"Really required win for us. We were really struggling in the last two series. Will really give a lot of confidence to the youngsters who've just joined us," Misbah-ul-Haq. "We were determined after the one-day series loss. One bad innings and we lost the match in Sri Lanka. We really did well in every department in this Test and that really helped us put Australia under pressure. These bowlers are young at international level, but they have a lot of experience in first-class level. They know how to bowl longer spells and build pressure. Their temperement was wonderful. They got confidence from the four-day game win. And conditions suited them too. Really important to consolidate. We haven't won a series against Australia in so long. Big incentive for us, all the guys are determined to do well against them and we need to play disciplined cricket. Stick to basics, focus and we can do anything"
Younis Khan is the Man of the Match " Thank you to my followers for the support. Fans back home, media, family, friends, trainer, Grant Flower [batting coach] for working with me. I came here a week earlier. [Laughs when asked there was no contribution by the board] Board wanted and I wanted to play. There was a situation when I didn't want to play. My family motivated me. They said there maybe records created. I am thankful to them. I wanted to come back after the results in ODI's and T20. I worked with Grant Flower for week. We tried out a lot of different things. I got hit in ribs and shoulder. I was ready for them. They bowled well on the first day but we stuck around, giving belief to the team to play well. Looking at the way Shehzad, Yasir Shah, Zulfiqar Babar, Misbah, Shafiq and Sarfaraz played it's very important. This win will take us a long way"
"No doubt Pakistan deserve a lot of credit. Beat us in all three facets. Batmen batted us out, spinners had us in trouble. We have a couple of days to turn it around," says Michael Clarke, "Want to use our bat a little more. We knew spin would play a lot, but a lot of us gout out to balls that didn't spin. So we want to get into the right positions [when we're batting against spin]. Smith and Johnson fought as hard as they could. Again, Pakistan deserve credit. Younis showed how to play spin and reverse swing. Any time you make 400-450, that helps the bowlers put pressure on the opposition. Our bowlers had to work hard on a flat wicket on day one. We can turn it around, definitely. We've got the talent, the attitude and I'm sure you will see a different team in the next Test"
Satish chavan: "whenever Johnson plays a test match he makes sure that his name is in the match summary (recent years)"
Talal Dar: "We lost 13 consecutive Test matches against them. Now we have won two in a row. Only 11 more to go."
3.39 pm Pakistan get together in a huddle, it's broken only so they can shake hands with the opposition players. Younis Khan gets a stump, Yasir Shah gets a stump on debut, Misbah looks like its just another day in the office. But no, this is Pakistan 1-0 up in a two-match series.
Massab: "Now I can study in peace." Not waiting for the presentation?
zohaib: "Can't stop tears from my eyes after long time unbelievable victory.Lovely boys congrats"
91.1;W;Babar to Siddle, OUT wait, what happened there? Umpire Erasmus did not move, then he did as if he was stepping away to ensure he doesn't get in line with a throw, if it comes. And then raises the finger. Siddle wants a review, but it comes back against him. Siddle jumped down the track to defend, and manages to get just a little inside edge onto pad and straight into the hands of silly point. Five-for for Babar and he deserved it, after a few drops off his bowling;Peter Siddle c Azhar Ali b Zulfiqar Babar 15 (66m 48b 1x4 0x6) SR: 31.25;
90.6;?;Yasir Shah to O'Keefe, no run good length ball on middle, O"Keefe's played out the over quite confidently;
90.5;?;Yasir Shah to O'Keefe, no run looped up outside off, O'Keefe pads up to inspire a few muted appeals;
90.4;?;Yasir Shah to O'Keefe, no run tossed up slower and a little wider outside off, O'Keefe doesn't play at it;

90.2;?;Yasir Shah to O'Keefe, no run nicely tossed up just outside off, O'Keefe is forward to defend again;
90.1;?;Yasir Shah to O'Keefe, no run tossed up on middle, O'Keefe lunges forward to block.;
89.6;?;Babar to Siddle, no run good length ball, which Siddle chooses to play back, and defends. Bit of turn away from the bat there.;
89.6;1nb;Babar to Siddle, (no ball) gets down the track to defend a tossed up delivery on off stump, Zulfi has overstepped though which means he has to bowl this again;
89.5;?;Babar to Siddle, no run goes back to a good length on middle and leg, defended;
89.4;2;Babar to Siddle, 2 runs driven quite smartly through the covers to [pick up a couple;
89.3;?;Babar to Siddle, no run gets down the track to the pitch of a flighted ball and drives to short cover;
89.2;?;Babar to Siddle, no run oh, have they got it here? Misbah has gone for the review after a flighted arm ball hits Siddle on the front pad! Hits in front of off stump as he was bringing his bat down at an angle. Another Australian batsman playing for the turn and he might rue it too. The crowd's clapping already. They know this is done and dusted, or they want it to be. Helooooo! It pitched in line, hit in line, but it was only clipping leg stump, so umpire's call it shall remain! Not out;
89.1;?;Babar to Siddle, no run loads of flight on this one just outside off, punched away to point;
88.6;W;Yasir Shah to Johnson, OUT Sarfraz is ecstatic! Pakistan are ecstatic! Has Mitch been stumped? The third umpire has been called in. This was tossed up outside off, lures the batsman forward but he plays inside the line. Lunged way too far forward, and his back foot seems to be on the line. Tries to drag it back, but has be managed to do so before the bails completely come off. Touch and go... as touch and go as it can be.. Umpire Llong has a tough call to make. And he clicks the red button! Mitch has been sent packing, the Australian dressing room is none too pleased.;Mitchell Johnson st ?Sarfaraz Ahmed b Yasir Shah 61 (161m 127b 6x4 1x6) SR: 48.03;

88.4;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run goes back to a good length ball on off stump and blocks. Better to go forward to that though;
88.3;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run huge appeal! Johnson's shouldered arms! Misbah has been convinced to go for a review. Some questions regarding the height here, which is why it was originally given not out. Still not the best decision to leave that ball. Impact was umpire's call, it clips the middle bail too, which remains umpire's call. Not out then;
88.2;2;Yasir Shah to Johnson, 2 runs a little more bounce again from Yasir, the batsman is rooted to his crease as he defends with soft hands. Good job too because it falls short and wide of the lone slip;
88.1;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run he keeps pulling out these rippers! Hits the rough at a decent length and it cuts back in quite quickly at Johnson and finds him a little slow pulling out that flick of his;
87.6;?;Rahat Ali to Siddle, no run but still goes for the short ball, Siddle blocks it off the back foot;
87.5;?;Rahat Ali to Siddle, no run banged in short again, but Siddle doesn't fancy this at all. Leg slip was brought in for that ball too;
87.5;3nb;Rahat Ali to Siddle, (no ball) 2 runs back of a length and cramping him up on middle, Siddle works it past short midwicket for a couple of runs. Seemed tight, but Johnson's made it back before the throw from the deep. Ump says Rahat's overstepped;

87.3;?;Rahat Ali to Siddle, no run good length ball on middle and leg, Siddle works it towards short midwicket in hopes of a single. Not there;
87.2;?;Rahat Ali to Siddle, no run banged in short, but he had directed it a little too far outside leg. Siddle doesn't need to bother with it;
87.1;1;Rahat Ali to Johnson, 1 run goes for the yorker, but Mitch isn't hassled by it. Whips it away to deep square leg. Neat wrists on display there;
86.6;1;Yasir Shah to Johnson, 1 run a little shortish and outside off, Mitch goes back and taps into the covers;
86.5;1;Yasir Shah to Siddle, 1 run pushed through on the pads to try and extract that magic delivery, but it only enables Siddle to flick behind square leg;
86.4;?;Yasir Shah to Siddle, no run lunges forward to try and smother the turn, and so he does;
86.3;?;Yasir Shah to Siddle, no run tossed up and angled in on middle, gets it to rip away quite impressively past the outside edge. Great drift into the batsman from the legspinner;
86.2;?;Yasir Shah to Siddle, no run that falls short of the slip fielder! That's a much better length from Yasir for his quicker pace, lures the batsman forward, coaxes the outside edge but it doesn't carry;
86.1;4;Yasir Shah to Siddle, FOUR runs presents a short ball outside off, Siddle accepts the gift with a back foot punch through the covers. Way to go, P Siddy;
85.6;?;Rahat Ali to Johnson, no run but this doesn't rise as far up to force Johnson into that defensive mindset. Pulls out the pull, but the short ball outisde off, sinks under his stroke;
85.5;?;Rahat Ali to Johnson, no run sways away from the line of this short ball, this one around the off stump. Rahat stares and Mitch replies, "I'm not playing";
85.4;?;Rahat Ali to Johnson, no run goes short on middle and leg, Johnson is happy to evade it;
85.3;2;Rahat Ali to Johnson, 2 runs looks to play the angle of a good length ball, but it straightens to snatch his leading edge. It's safe though, and fetches him two through the covers;
85.2;?;Rahat Ali to Johnson, no run shortish and outside off, Mitch taps it with an open face towards point;
85.1;?;Rahat Ali to Johnson, no run strays in line as this back of a length delivery wanders down leg. Johnson looks to tickle it fine, but misses;
84.6;?;Md Imran Khan to Siddle, no run fullish and a shade outside off, Siddle defends with an angled bat;
84.5;2;Md Imran Khan to Siddle, 2 runs capably handles a fuller ball slanted on the pads. Got forward and worked it with a subtle roll of his wrists to get it wide of mid-on;

84.1;?;Md Imran Khan to Johnson, no run fullish on middle and off, kept out resolutely off the back foot;

83.1;?;Rahat Ali to Siddle, no run fuller delivery outside off, Siddle doesn't need to bother with it;
82.6;4;Hafeez to Johnson, FOUR runs that's glorious! Lovely little bit of footwork to make this shot, moves a touch to his left to make sure he was beside the flighted ball and then launched it over mid-off's head with a lovely straight bat. An extension of defence;
82.5;?;Hafeez to Johnson, no run gets across on off stump, stands up tall and blocks a skidder on off stump;

80.6;4;Babar to Johnson, FOUR runs that's his fifty and it comes in typically belligerent fashion. Generous applause as he clears that front leg and takes advantage of a half-volley on middle. Thump over to the wide long-on boundary;

79.3;?;Yasir Shah to Siddle, no run tossed up outside off and turning further away, refuses to play;
79.2;2;Yasir Shah to Siddle, 2 runs gets his first runs of the Test with a back foot whip to deep square leg. And retains strike. Good stroke;

78.2;1;Babar to Johnson, 1 run goes back to a flatter ball and clips it behind square leg for a single;
78.1;6;Babar to Johnson, SIX runs oho! Mitch is definitely shedding some of his restraint. Gets into the 40s with a mow over wide long-on. Gets down one one-knee, picks it up and wallops it;
77.6;?;Yasir Shah to Siddle, no run good length ball just outside off, defended off the front foot;
77.5;?;Yasir Shah to Siddle, no run uncertainty! Tossed up just outside off to lure Siddle on the front foot, he was all set to defend but then decided to pull his bat away. Not quite quick enough and it runs off the open face to gully;

77.3;?;Yasir Shah to Siddle, no run fired in at the base of off stump, Siddle blocks. Still on a pair;

76.1;?;Babar to Johnson, no run goes back to a good length ball that rips in off the rough to hit the top flap of the pad. Mitch was shouldering arms rather. Wait, did it even hit the pad? I thought it did from the appeal, but I'm not sure that touched anything..;
75.6;W;Yasir Shah to Smith, OUT huge appeal from Pakistan, they are absolutely convinced. The umpires though look like they will take some assistance. Smith runs down the track and is met by a tossed up ball fired in on the pads, he looks to tuck it past short leg. But he's found the man. Terrific work again from the Pakistan close-in fielders. Smith is dragging himself off the field, head down, disconsolate. Such a good innings... Such a dogged innings. Gets a pat on his shoulder from his captain as he finally reaches the dressing room;Steven Smith c Asad Shafiq b Yasir Shah 55 (230m 175b 3x4 0x6) SR: 31.42;
75.5;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run good length ball just a touch outside off, defended bat and pad close to the body;

75.2;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run looped up on off stump, defended off the front foot;

74.4;4;Md Imran Khan to Johnson, FOUR runs banged in short, Mitch has pummeled it well in front of square. Took care to keep the ball down, but still doesn't compromise on his power. Not the easiest stroke considering that ball came up around shoulder height, without much room to free his arms;
74.3;?;Md Imran Khan to Johnson, no run full and sliding down leg, MItch shuffles across in hopes for a fine-leg boundary. Doesn't connect;
74.2;1;Md Imran Khan to Smith, 1 run gets a little curve in at Smith, but he isn't bothered by it at all. Tucks it away through to deep midwicket;
74.1;?;Md Imran Khan to Smith, no run jumps across on off stump to block a good length ball;

73.5;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run runs down the track and closes the face too early. Lovely flight and chance of pace from Yasir, as this lures the leading edge.;

73.1;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run goes back to a good length ball and pushes it back to mid-on. I like the pace he's bowling at, just quick enough to get some purchase off this slow deck;

71.4;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run nips down the track and this one reaches him quicker as the bowler spots his movement. Manages to tuck it to leg gully and has to hurry back into his crease;
71.3;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run ripper! This leaps up off the surface and Johnson does extremely well to soften his grip and blunt it. That just spat out of the pitch, from nowhere!;
71.2;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run good length ball that gets loads of spin in again, Johnson looks to roll his wrists on it and manages to do so to keep leg slip out of the game;
71.1;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run loads of turn as the rough behaves itself for once. Johnson was stretching forward to block, but the ball rips in at him, past the bat, to take the front pad to slip;

70.5;?;Babar to Smith, no run gets down the track to a length ball on leg stump and pads it away;
70.4;?;Babar to Smith, no run loads of flight on this delivery on off stump, Smith is happy to defend it;

70.1;1;Babar to Johnson, 1 run tossed up just outside off, Mitch drives strongly to long-on;
69.6;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run gives this a lot of rip on off stump, but it doesn't materialise. Smith goes back to block quite calmly;

69.1;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run good length ball outside off, Smith shoulders arms;
68.6;2;Babar to Johnson, 2 runs that's another drop! Yasir's misjudged it at square leg! Another sweep, off a length ball which bounces a touch too much for him to control. The top edge should have been pouched, but Yasir has not backtracked enough. Misjudgement again;

67.5;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run tossed up just outside off, defended;
67.4;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run there's always a bit of excitement when a leggie's on. This was tossed up on off stump, brought Smith forward to block and then pulls the ball away outside off. Terrific bowling;

67.1;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run goes back to a good length ball just outside off and blocks;
66.6;1;Babar to Johnson, 1 run dropped on the deep square leg boundary? or so I think. Mitch was playing against his nature this long and is finally lured into pulling out the big slog sweep. Shehzad was on the boundary, he has to come in, he has to dive, and he seems to have shelled it. Yep, more straightforward than I thought...;

65.4;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run quicker and tossed up outside off, Johnson does well to roll his wrists on top of it and keep it down from short leg;
65.3;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run what happened there?! This ripped in quite late off the rough, beats Johnson's flick and lobs up off this thigh pad, takes a bit of bat on its followthrough. Too tough a chance for the keeper;
65.2;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run goes for a slog sweep, off a flatter ball outside off. Finds short midwicket;
65.1;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run tossed up just outside off, Mitch is forward to blunt it.;

64.2;?;Babar to Smith, no run runs at the bowler and hammers it at short cover at a catchable height, but it has many miles behind it. Still at international cricket, it might be a chance. Low to the captain's right, but he shells it;

63.6;?;Hafeez to Johnson, no run goes on with the arm, but since it started outside off Mitch doesn't want to play at it;

62.1;4;Babar to Smith, FOUR runs gorgeous shot! He's used his feet wonderfully all this innings, this time he pins it with a bit more aggressive intent. Drives it handsomely through extra cover;
61.6;?;Hafeez to Johnson, no run similar sort of ball, only it doesn't skid as much this time. Johnson stays back to block;
61.5;?;Hafeez to Johnson, no run was that drifting down leg? Huge appeal though, especially from Hafeez. This was pushed through on middle and leg, keeps low as well to lure Mitch to play around his pads. Sarfraz says it might have slid down to dissuade his captain from referring;

60.1;?;Babar to Johnson, no run very tentative footwork from Johnson. Didn't know whether to go forward or back. Decides to keep to his crease and pokes outside off at a good length ball that turns in just a touch. Plays inside the line and is beaten;
59.6;?;Hafeez to Smith, no run gets down the track and pulls out a whip of his wrists, sends the flighted ball angled in at him to deep midwicket;
59.5;?;Hafeez to Smith, no run goes back to block a good length ball on the stumps;
59.4;?;Hafeez to Smith, no run nicely tossed up just outside off, defended;
59.3;1;Hafeez to Johnson, 1 run goes back to tuck a good length ball around the corner for a single to fine leg;
59.2;?;Hafeez to Johnson, no run slider again, skids on off this dusty old pitch to make Johnson hurry into his back foot defensive;

58.6;1;Babar to Johnson, 1 run goes back to block a flatter ball outside off;

58.4;?;Babar to Johnson, no run goes back to a good length ball and tucks it to short leg;
58.3;1;Babar to Smith, 1 run goes back on middle and leg, takes care of a delivery that bounces very low with a straight blade;
58.2;?;Babar to Smith, no run;
58.1;?;Babar to Smith, no run runs down the track, while making room for himself. A little too much, actually and Smith realises he is in danger. He tries to throw his hands at it, but he's yorked himself. Can't connect. Sarfraz isn't too alert this time. Stumping chance but it is missed;
57.6;1;Hafeez to Smith, 1 run runs at the bowler and whips a tossed up ball from outside off to deep midwicket;
57.5;?;Hafeez to Smith, no run looped up wide outside off, Smith won't be suckered into playing those;

57.3;1;Hafeez to Johnson, 1 run pushed through on leg stump, Mitch whips it behind square leg;
57.2;?;Hafeez to Johnson, no run slides on with the arm, but the acute angle from around the stumps allows Mitch to let go down the leg side;
57.1;?;Hafeez to Johnson, no run tossed up nice and high to tempt Johnson into a forceful drive to mid-on;
56.6;?;Rahat Ali to Smith, no run fullish delivery straightens outside off, forces Smith to get squared up as he defends into the covers;
56.5;?;Rahat Ali to Smith, no run oopsy! There's a false shot from Smith, a very rare one in this innings and he's worn a rather painful block on the stomach! Went on the pull a little too early, tries to adjust midway with his bat-swing, doesn't succeed and is left a little winded;
56.4;?;Rahat Ali to Smith, no run fullish and outside off, Smith gets across to the 140kph delivery and pushes it to cover;
56.3;?;Rahat Ali to Smith, no run back of a length and outside off, shuffles across to block;
56.2;?;Rahat Ali to Smith, no run full on off stump, Smith gets forward to block;

55.6;?;Babar to Johnson, no run plays for the turn, but it doesn't manifest. Tossed up just outside off to lure Mitch forward into a block and it holds it line to beat the outside edge;

54.5;1;Rahat Ali to Johnson, 1 run good length ball around the stumps, tucked away through square leg;
54.4;4b;Rahat Ali to Johnson, 4 byes another one, this comes as byes though. Goes for another yorker, coupled with reverse swing, but he directs it a bit too far down leg;
54.3;4;Rahat Ali to Johnson, FOUR runs think he knew that was on the cards and he's ended a woeful drought. First four in 300-odd balls; 273 it seems. Tries a reversing, inswinging yorker on middle. Not quite on target though and Johnson flicks it away wonderfully.;
54.2;?;Rahat Ali to Johnson, no run another bouncer a shade outside off, Johnson sinks below it;
54.1;?;Rahat Ali to Johnson, no run 137kph, goes for the short ball against Johnson, has to duck and sway away from the line. Rahat liked that, flashes a smile;
53.6;?;Babar to Smith, no run brilliantly bowled that, saw the batsman coming down at him and held the length back. Babar's control has been striking. He's always looked to attack the stumps;
53.5;?;Babar to Smith, no run good use of the feet again and a deft tuck through midwicket seemed on the horizon, but short leg does brilliant work . Shafiq, was it?;
53.4;?;Babar to Smith, no run looped up and drifting in on middle from around the wicket, as he has been bowling all over, defended;
53.3;?;Babar to Smith, no run leaves his crease to defend a tossed up delivery on middle and leg;

52.6;?;Rahat Ali to Johnson, no run lines up a back of a length delivery on off stump and flicks it to short leg;
52.5;?;Rahat Ali to Johnson, no run looks like he's concentrating on keeping as still as possible, helps him out with a good length ball that ducks back in on middle;
52.4;?;Rahat Ali to Johnson, no run good length with appreciable shape back in, Mitch is stuck on the crease and wears it on the pads. Mild appeal for leg before, but it was sliding down;

52.2;?;Rahat Ali to Smith, no run good length ball on and around off stump, defended cautiously;
52.1;?;Rahat Ali to Smith, no run negotiates a fuller ball on middle and leg with a dead straight bat;
51.6;?;Babar to Johnson, no run another good length ball pushed outside off, Johnson doesn't want any of it. That would be lunch;
51.5;?;Babar to Johnson, no run goes around now and works the angle across the left-hander, left alone though;
51.4;2;Babar to Johnson, 2 runs goes for a sweep again, this time he controls it better. Gets on top of the bounce and works it past leg slip;
51.3;2;Babar to Johnson, 2 runs tossed up outside off, drives towards cover;
51.2;?;Babar to Johnson, no run goes for a sweep, but it's an awkward one and he almost has to weave his head out of the way to ensure its safety in case there was extra bounce. Only gets it as far as leg slip;
51.1;?;Babar to Johnson, no run goes back to a good length ball that doesn't turn again. That rough is doing the opposite of what it's supposed to, at least from the Aussie perspective. Gets the outside edge, but it goes down before reaching slip. Good work from Younis diving to his left;
50.6;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run tossed up on off stump, Smith drives into the covers quite well;
50.5;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run tossed up outside off, Smith defends to silly point with a good stride forward;
50.4;1;Yasir Shah to Johnson, 1 run nips down the track and works it away through midwicket to get off strike;
50.3;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run huge appeal for an catch at leg slip. Johnson loads up for a a sweep again, misjudges the length again and it loops up off his forearm. Good decision from Pakistan not to go for a review;
50.2;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run good length ball that rips in quite sharply, Johnson hurries into a flick through square leg;
50.1;?;Yasir Shah to Johnson, no run tossed up just outside off, goes for a lap sweep but he gets it only off the toe of the bat;

47.3;1;Babar to Johnson, 1 run pushed through on middle, Mitch works it past a diving short leg;
47.2;?;Babar to Johnson, no run good length ball that rips in from outside off, Johnson leaves rather bravely as this rips in quite alarmingly;
47.1;W;Babar to Haddin, OUT oh, that's not the best bit of batting against spin! Haddin has turned a relatively straight delivery into a top class delivery! This Zulfi spell has brought Pakistan so much joy, not least of all for him. Wonderful reward for a bowler with amazing accuracy. Haddin was too slow on the forward defensive and was bring his bat around his front pad. Ample gap for the ball to skid on and ram into the stumps;Brad Haddin b Zulfiqar Babar 0 (14m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
46.6;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run shortish and outside off stump, legspinner this time and Smith is happy to leave it well alone;
46.5;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run was the the wrong 'un? Yep. Fires it in a bit short, and it doesn't quite turn either. Smith stays back and taps it into the covers;

46.3;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run tossed up just outside off, defended;

45.6;?;Babar to Haddin, no run tossed up on middle, Haddin reaches the pitch to smother it;
45.5;?;Babar to Haddin, no run jumps back again as he meets a quicker, flatter delivery on leg stump. Kept low again;
45.4;?;Babar to Haddin, no run goes back to defend another good length ball that doesn't quite bounce as much. Those close-in fielders must be troubling him;
45.3;?;Babar to Haddin, no run tossed up on off stump, to bring the batsman forward to block. Silly point is alert as ever.;
45.2;?;Babar to Haddin, no run tossed up and angled in on middle and leg, Haddin defends;

43.5;?;Babar to Haddin, no run brings down his bat in front of pad and this one loops up too, but far too straight for Azhar to pose a threat;
43.4;?;Babar to Haddin, no run loads of flight on off stump again, defended with softer hands;
43.3;W;Babar to Marsh, OUT that's brilliant work from Azhar! This was by no means an outside edge, excellent reflexes. Again gorgeous loop from Zulfiqar to lure the batsman forward into playing with hard hands. Goes straight at silly point who does well to stay low enough to grab it;Mitchell Marsh c Azhar Ali b Zulfiqar Babar 3 (14m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 37.5;

41.5;3;Hafeez to Smith, 3 runs driven out of the rough, but he doesn't need to worry about it when his front foot is so confidently forward and hits through the line. Very good-looking stroke;

40.4;?;Md Imran Khan to Marsh, no run more reverse swing, Marsh does well to keep it out. Gingerly front foot stride though;
40.3;W;Md Imran Khan to Rogers, OUT Imraaaaan, he's given Pakistan the spark they needed! Moves around the wicket to spear in a very full delivery on middle and off stump. Possibly a little bit of reverse as well to make Rogers play all around it. Bails go flying, Imran pulls out the aeroplane celebration;Chris Rogers b Imran Khan 43 (169m 131b 1x4 0x6) SR: 32.82;
40.2;?;Md Imran Khan to Rogers, no run looks far more adept against pace, but that doesn't mean he's looked too suspect against spin today. This is been a pretty good resistance from Rogers. Back of a length delivery, defended right under his eyes;

39.3;?;Hafeez to Rogers, no run runs down the track and whips a flighted ball to mid-on;

39.1;?;Hafeez to Rogers, no run goes back to a good length ball and taps it through the covers;
38.6;?;Md Imran Khan to Smith, no run 130 kph, seeks the yorker on middle and off stump, slow enough for Smith to control it though and trudge off for some refreshments. First hour of the day done. Is there a checklist somewhere?;

36.3;?;Hafeez to Rogers, no run nips down the track to push a tossed up delivery back at the bowler;
36.2;?;Hafeez to Rogers, no run oooh, that's wonderful use if flight. Lured the batsman forward and then made the ball dip on him to claim the outside edge. But Rogers is wily as well. Holds the bat with soft hands and ensures the outside edge doesn't carry;
36.1;?;Hafeez to Rogers, no run tossed up outside off, Rogers is happy to watch it hit the rough and leap away to the keeper's gloves;
35.6;1;Rahat Ali to Rogers, 1 run lovely stride forward to meet a fuller ball and he drills it to the right of mid-off. Have to give it to Rogers here, he's not letting those unplayables play on his mind for too long;

35.1;?;Rahat Ali to Rogers, no run you little beauty! That kind of trouble is usually brought about by a spinner on a pitch as work as this, but Rahat gets a back of a good length delivery to straighten off the deck and beat the outside edge. Rogers is bemused;
