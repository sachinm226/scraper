Data
New Zealand have collapsed from 120 for one to be 238 all out. Some soft dismissals were the cause, it must be said, however Australia were able to create enough pressure, especially from Hauritz at a crucial time. The crucial loss was McCullum for 61 off 75 balls just as he was looking to accumulate through the middle and the hosts were unable to gain any momentum from then on, losing wickets consistently right through the innings.
Nathan Hauritz was the pick of the bowlers for the visitors, taking three for 46, with his only blip being hit for three consecutive sixes by Daryl Tuffey. Shane Watson continues to take crucial wickets at vital moments, dismissing Guptill just when New Zealand were starting to gain the upper hand and then Hopkins from the first ball of the Batting Power Play.
Join us in 40 minutes when Australia chase 239 to win and to take the series. See you soon
Welcome back. We have some bad news from Auckland as it has started to rain during the innings break. The covers are on the pitch and play will not start at the scheduled time.
6.05pm It is still raining here and while it is not heavy it has been a consistent downpour. There is enough moisture out there to keep the players from the field for a time yet. If we are able to get play before 6.30pm there will be no loss of overs, however, from that time on we will be losing time and overs. I will keep you posted.
6.55pm The rain has stopped and the ground staff are out in the middle trying to dry the ground which is quite damp without having any areas of the ground clogged with surface water.
Being a rugby venue, the drainage here is very good and, as long as there is no more rain, we should see some more play within the next hour at the worst.
The clouds are clearing and it looks as though we are only a matter of time away from getting a start. The match will be reduced, however, it is not yet certain as to how many overs will be bowled this evening.
7.05pm With the amount of moisture in the outfield, the umpires have decided to have another look in 15 minutes time and with clear skies above, it should be positive news at that.
7.40pm The players are on their way back out onto the field with Australia needing 200 to win from just 34 overs. Power Play 1 is 7 overs, Power Play 2 (bowling) is 4 overs and Power Play 3 (batting) is 3 overs long. Bond to begin to Watson

Hello and welcome to Auckland for the 4th ODI between New Zealand and Australia.
Ricky Ponting has won the toss and Australia will bowl first. Ponting is happy with the formula they used during the last match in Hamilton and he sees that as the best way to win the game and the series. Amazingly, it's his fourth straight correct call with the toss.
We have a fine afternoon forecast with a maximum temperature of 23 degrees C and no rain scheduled until much later on tonight. The drop in pitch is in good condition and should play even better than it did on Saturday
In team news, New Zealand have made a number of changes with Ingram, Broom and Mason left out, while Stewart comes in for his ODI debut and Franklin and Tuffey are back into the side after injuries.
The New Zealand batting order will be: McCullum, Guptill, Taylor, Stewart, Styris, Vettori, Hopkins, Franklin, Tuffey, Bond, Southee.
Australia maintain the same XI from Hamilton and are in great shape to take the series with a game remaining.
Harris to start with the new ball to McCullum.
 Innings Start
Australia take the series 3-1 with one game remaining with another comprehensive win here in Auckland.
Ponting played a great innings under pressure and basically counter-attacked the New Zealand attack when Bond was fired up at the top of the innings, with 50 off just 35 deliveries.
Cameron Whites deserves a lot of praise for bringing the game home with 50 not out and his amazing summer continues. Hussey and Voges played important innings too.
New Zealand simply did not score enough runs, once again, and the Duckworth/Lewis system actually gave them a greater chance of winning, unlike five days ago during the second ODI.
McCullum struck the ball cleanly for 61 but he didn't receive enough support at the top of the innings to allow New Zealand to build a sunstantial score.
Nathan Hauritz made the important breakthroughs, nabbing McCullum, Stewart and Franklin in a spell that squeezed the life out of the New Zealand innings. Watson, again, provided the crucial partnership-breaking wickets and finished with for two for 24.
New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori is disappointed in both the batting and bowling. His batsmen didn't socre enough runs, being 120 for one before collapsing to be all out for 238, and his bowlers weren't consistent enough to create enough pressure.
Ponting is rapt with the team effort and heaps praise on most of his players.
Cam White is named Man of the Match and he's happy to see it through to the end for the second game in a row. His game plan is to hit long and straight and it's obviously working pretty well for him. It's his first Chappell-Hadlee series victory in New Zealand so he is a very happy man.
The fifth and final ODI is in Wellington on Saturday March 13 at 2pm local time, that's 1am GMT. Join us in a couple of days time as New Zealand look to salvage some pride, while Australia will look to finish the series in style.
On behalf of the crew here at Cricinfo, this is Marc Ellison signing off. Bye for now, see you in two days time.
