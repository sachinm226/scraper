Target 192 and it's going to be a stiff task for this inexperienced Australian line-up. It was a good batting pitch after all.
Coulter-Nile: "I know I will not be needed because the top six will finish this off." He's confident.
A lot of the West Indians enjoyed the conditions tonight. A few dropped catches. Can Australia's top six finish this off? Join us shortly for the chase.

And finally...
West Indies: Chris Gayle, Johnson Charles, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Narsingh Deonarine, Devon Thomas (wk), Darren Sammy (c), Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Tino Best, Kieran Powell (12th)
Toss: West Indies have won the toss and they will bat first.
Australia: Finch, Marsh, Voges, Bailey (capt), Rohrer, Haddin (wk) Faulkner, Cutting, Coulter-Nile, McKay, Hazlewood.
Rohrer, Coulter-Nile and Hazlewood are making their debuts.
Waiting on the Windies team. The news is that Chris Gayle is playing.
Gareth: "It may not be the A-Team, but it's not a bad side. Lots of in-form players. I think the most interesting thing is the lack of a spinner. Especially how much Gayle and Co enjoy the ball coming onto the bat."
Paul: "@Gareth - that's because every spinner worth a dime has been crated up and carted off to India. Pretty sure even John Howard was considered on the strength of his brief and Youtube-worthy bowling performance a few years back."
Caino: "Great to see 3 WA boys in the team! Coulter-Nile is a definite young talent on the rise, watch out for him tonight with the ball and with the bat aswell if gets a chance"
6pm: Welcome everyone to the coverage of the one-off T20 between West Indies and Australia at the Gabba. You might rub your eyes at first glance of this Australian line-up. Resembles a BBL composite XI. The main guys are away in India for the Test warm-ups, hence an unrecognisable line-up at the Gabba.
Two Australian teams reminds you of the WSC quadrangular in 1994-95, with an Australia A team added. What a resounding success that was...
Sofa: "At least today, this "B-team" will give us a look at several potential 2015 World Cup Australia players, in contrast to if an "A-team" was playing, of which probably three quarters will retire or get dropped (because of declining form) by the 2015 World Cup. Keep in mind that the world cup will be in Australia and New Zealand."
 Innings Start
So much for Coulter-Nile's prediction at the halfway mark...
Haddin: "WI showed why they're world champions in this form. Those run-outs changed the game. No exchange (between me and Pollard after my dismissal)."
Pollard is the Man of the Match: "We got a really good score on the board. Hopefully we can improve our 50-over game as well. Took me a couple of games too late to find form. We've got to get the team balance right to win more consistently."
West Indies head back home with something to shout about. It was a tough tour for them. Can't help but state how much they missed Marlon Samuels. Wishing him a speedy recovery from the eye injury.
Victories for both the men and women's West Indies teams today. Twitter will be abuzz surely. Thanks for joining us today. Cheers!
