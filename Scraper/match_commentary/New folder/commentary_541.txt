David Quinlan: "For a top class team to lose 6 for 23 is disgraceful. Not even a yelp from the tail, and all the hard work from Hughes and Katich comes undone!"
Australia must have been eyeing a score of well above 400 after that opening stand but lost their way badly, particularly today. They lost their last six wickets for just 23 - and their last five for just 4 - as the South African seamers tore away at them, troubling their batsmen especially with the short ball. The pitch has helped the bowlers today so Johnson and Hilfenhaus will bank on some assistance.
107.4;W;Steyn to Hilfenhaus, OUT Australia have collapsed here! Fraction short on the off stump and moved away, Hilfenhaus prodded at it off the back foot, got the outside edge and Smith at first slip pouched it easily moving to his right;Ben Hilfenhaus c Smith b Steyn 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
107.3;?;Steyn to Hilfenhaus, no run similar delivey but lands just slightly wider tha the previous one, Hilfy is able to back away from it quite easily;
107.2;W;Steyn to Siddle, OUT Referral, That's a snorter! Short on the off stump and spat off the pitch, Siddle tries to basically cover his face with his bat, takes his hand off the bat but only after it seems he has gloved it, Boucher snaps it and Asad Rauf raises his finger immediately. Siddle has doubts though and calls for a referral. It's in vain as hot spot indicates there was a faint white mark on the gloves. Perhaps he felt he took his hand off before it hit him, which, according to the rule, would have been not out. However, the replays indicate otherwise. Australia are nine down.;Peter Siddle c ?Boucher b Steyn 0 (10m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

105.5;?;Ntini to Siddle, no run saves the hattrick by moving forward to defend;
105.4;W;Ntini to Johnson, OUT Oh dear Oh dear ... What was Mitch thinking? It was full, it was straight and Mitchell decides its time to shoulder arms. Dead duck. The ball landed in line with the stumps and straightened a fraction - Mitch thought Ntini would be taking it away as usual - and caught him in front. Australia are crumbling here. What a morning. The ball landed in middle and leg and would have hit the middle and off;Mitchell Johnson lbw b Ntini 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
105.3;W;Ntini to Haddin, OUT Another one! Short outside off, he could have hit that anywhere but pulled it straight to Amla at midwicket who takes it comfortably, that definitely makes it South Africa's morning;Brad Haddin c Amla b Ntini 5 (23m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;

104.4;4;Kallis to North, FOUR runs shot! Just a fraction full outside off, gets forward and drives it crisply wide of mid-off where Morkel doesn't quite get his dive right;
104.3;?;Kallis to North, no run short of a good length outside off, holding its line, North lets it go;
104.2;1;Kallis to Haddin, 1 run came back in, good length on the off stump, defends it on the leg side for a quick single short of midwicket;
104.1;?;Kallis to Haddin, no run beatenstraightaway, full, meaty ball outside off, Haddin chases it, trying to cream it through the covers, misses as the ball zips away off the pitch;

Change from both ends, Kallis comes in
Many would disagree with Hieu: "With all the chopping and changing in the Australian cricket team, isnt it about time they let Hussey go and get some form somewhere else? He is starting to really bring the team down."
 Innings Start
Australia will bat on so no follow-on. They lead by 214, a massive one as they look to close out the series. It was all over before you could blink. Steyn flashed at a wide one and Ntini was trapped in front the following ball. Siddle will be on a hat-trick when he takes the new ball soon. It's been a superb turnaround by the Australians after they collapsed yesterday morning. They'll look to pile on the agony.
57.3;W;Siddle to Ntini, OUT that's the end of the innings! Siddle lands it on a good length just outside off and gets it to angle inwards, the ball clips Ntini's pads in line with legstump and Bowden raises the finger, Smith won't come out to bat;Makhaya Ntini lbw b Siddle 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
57.2;W;Siddle to Steyn, OUT very early success for Australia! Siddle pitches it up wide of the offstump and has Steyn chasing it without moving his feet, the ball clips the toe of the bat and it's an easy catch for Haddin, Steyn will be kicking himself for throwing it away, Duminy needs support;Dale Steyn c ?Haddin b Siddle 8 (59m 41b 1x4 0x6) SR: 19.51;

Nick: "In response to Marsh. It's funny how, what started out as being an "inexperienced" and "unbalanced" attack has suddenly become an "excellent" attack in the space of 1 test match. This just goes to show how Australia (in terms of depth) are head and shoulders above anyone else in the world. How many other sides could have the injuries and retirements that we have had to bear over the past couple of years and STILL be the best in the world?"

 Innings Start
Australia win by 175 runs and lead the series 2-0. They've completely turned the tables on South Africa after what happened in Australia late last year. Talk about revenge.
South Africa were in with a fighting chance to draw the game at the start this morning but the new ball did the trick. Both Kallis and de Villiers fell early and the result was inevitable from there on. Australia were under pressure at the start of the series to retain their No.1 ranking and they have done so in ruthless fashion, thanks to their young brigade.
South Africa will blame it all on their batting in the first innings of both Tests. Was it complacency or were their players tired? Robin Jackman made a valid point on commentary that the board should have organised a practice game for the Test side against a composite XI before the series to shrug off the rustiness. That they managed to beat India and West Indies after losing the opening Test is another story. But against Australia, you cannot afford to take things lightly and hopefully lessons will be learnt.
Stay with us for the presentation.
Smith: "We haven't been able to maintain the intensity. We've got to be honest with ourselves and take it on the chin. We'd like to bounce back as soon as possible. I went 10 years without breaking a finger and now I've broken two in three Tests. The squad has done well over a period of time."
Ponting: "We knew we had our backs to the wall. People probably overlooked how close the series was back at home. It feels different ( leading a team I have built). All of a sudden we look good again (laughs)."
Phillip Hughes is the Man of the Match "Been an exciting two weeks. There's been a lot of hype and talk about how different my batting is. All the guys in the pub at Macksville (NSW) got a free beer (laughs)."
That's it from all of us here. We'll see you at Newlands in CapeTown on March 19. On behalf of Siddhartha Talya and Raju, this is Kanishkaa signing off. Cheers!
