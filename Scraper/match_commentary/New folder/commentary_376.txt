Data
Quite an anti-climax for West Indies, considering the start. They completely lost the plot especially after they lost Smith and Australia did really well to pull things back. What West Indies can learn from their opponents is the use of the slower ball. There were plenty of them. McKay especially choked the batsmen with it.
Alan Gardner, fresh from the Wanderer's washout, will take you through the rest of the game Join us soon.

While we wait, read the preview of this game.
Looks like a great day for cricket. Big queues outside the ground
1.20pm: Good day everybody and welcome to the coverage of the second and final T20, in Kensington Oval. It's a beautiful day and sell-out crowd at Bridgetown. It's bleeding runs at the Wanderers. Will it be a similar story here?
The one-day series was squared. West Indies will have to win this one to level the two-match series.
 Innings Start
5.40pm: We're back out on the pitch for the presentations ...
Australia captain George Bailey: "Great start from the West Indies, I think we pulled it back to about par, 160, and I thought we were on course to knock it off. They put pressure on us, the wicket of David Warner was huge, run-outs change matches. The crowd were great and hopefully we provided some good entertainment."
West Indies captain Darren Sammy: "We knew it was a 180-plus pitch. We tried Polly and myself up the order to try and get some momentum- that didn't work today but we kept going. The work we've been doing in the camp and throughout the series has been paying off and I want to ask the boys to keep doing that. We want to keep doing well in the Tests and hopefully continue the good results."
Dwayne Smith is named Man of the Match: "I was pleased with the performance and glad we got a win. I've been doing a lot of work on my batting, doing the things I know and it seems to be working."
Man of the Series is Shane Watson: "Today was a bit disappointing to not get the result we wanted. It's been an up and down series and today was another learning experience. It worked out well for us to hold them back to 160. We were well on the way so it's disappointing and once again a learning experience."
That's it from me - have a great weekend and do join us for the first Test, which starts on Saturday April 7. Bye!
5.30pm: West Indies have tied the series, just as they did the one-dayers, and put another dent in the tourists' confidence. Despite a spectacular collapse, they got enough on the board and managed to keep a lid on the Australian scoring - getting rid of David Warner was particularly crucial, thanks to an exhilarating run out from Dwayne Bravo. He, along with Marlon Samuels and Fidel Edwards, bowled superbly and West Indies deserved their win - one which keeps them above Afghanistan in the ICC rankings.
