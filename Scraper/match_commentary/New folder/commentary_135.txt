Innings break What an incredible display from South Africa. They scored 130 from the last 10 overs and 75 from the last five overs. It was all due to Faf du Plessis and David Miller. From 3 for 55, they set new South Africa record for partnerships in ODIs against Australia. Faf made his 10th ODI hundred. David Miller his fifth, and his highest ODI score. Huge task for Australia to chase this down. Join us after the dinner break in 20 minutes time.

Here's Pat Cummins replacing Starc
 Innings Start
South Africa win by 40 runs and take the series 2-1. A very fine performance today, highlighted by that huge stand between Faf du Plessis and David Miller then some outstanding death bowling. Dale Steyn to the fore again. Australia threatened for a while through Shaun Marsh's hundred and some strong hitting by Marcus Stoinis, but their poor start had left them a lot to do.
Kagiso Rabada: "It's never easy coming to Australia. We wanted to keep the momentum we had after Sri Lanka. Everyone played very well so we're very happy. Faf and David kept going and inflicted proper damage at the end there. They won us the game today. As soon as the batters got in, they look rather comfortable. The difference was that Faf and Davey went right through to the end. Our bowling attack spoke about needing to be ruthless. I think we did that today."
Shaun Marsh: "Disappointing not to be there at the end. I probably should have tried to go a bit deeper. They put us under pressure and we couldn't get there in the end. Full credit to South Africa. They outplayed us throughout the series."
We'll bring you the presentation shortly...
Man of the Match goes to David Miller "It's always a great feeling to contribute, and when you win it's sweeter. We were in a little bit of trouble so nice to bat some time. Wanted to extend the partnership as much as we could. Nice to make it a big one. They put a bit of a scare into us, but credit to our bowlers who have been fantastic the whole series."
Aaron Finch "Every time you get a couple of set batters at the end of the innings it's hard to contain. They bowled exceptionally well a the end, credit to them in the last 10 overs. After 35 overs we were in a great position but they took it away at the end. With the short boundary, once you get in you can really cash in. They batted extremely well. That partnership between Marcus and Shaun was outstanding to give us a chance to launch. If we'd been at that point two down we'd have been a chance, but not to be."
Faf du Plessis "It's good, I thought we played our best game of cricket. We challenged ourselves to put in a performance. A high pressure game. From a batting point of view we were, but from a death-bowling point of view we were excellent. Really good that we could get tested against two set batsmen and the way we responded was great to see. Myself and Dave had to somehow get a score together, we talked about trying to get to 240 but with Dave's power we were able to get going. We'll remember this place fondly."
So the series win to South Africa and they deserved it. A few things for Australia to take with them in their rebuilding, but they have a distance to go in one-day cricket. They won't play 50 overs again until January against India as they switch back to T20 mode before the Tests. There is a one-off T20 between these two sides on Saturday and we'll be back to bring you the action. For now, though, it's goodbye from Gnasher and Alex and thanks for joining us.
49.6;?;Rabada to Hazlewood, no run and quite aptly it's a yorker to finish, dug out to the covers;
49.6;1w;Rabada to Hazlewood, 1 wide a short ball outside leg stump, goes over his back and it's called wide...a few smiles around;
49.5;1;Rabada to Cummins, 1 run low full toss which he whips to midwicket;

49.2;?;Rabada to Zampa, no run backs away to leg, short of a length, and has a swing and a miss;
49.1;W;Rabada to Starc, OUT well, that's pretty soft...round the wicket, back of a length, and Starc just chips it straight up in the air;Mitchell Starc c & b Rabada 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
48.6;?;Steyn to Cummins, no run another dot ball, 141kph, short of a length and he's through the shot too early (despite the pace);

48.4;?;Steyn to Cummins, no run beats him a short ball as Cummins pulls;
48.3;W;Steyn to Maxwell, OUT finds deep cover and that's that, a sliced lofted cover drive. Pretty comfortable catch for Hendricks. Another for Steyn who has been outstanding;Glenn Maxwell c Hendricks b Steyn 35 (27b 3x4 0x6) SR: 129.62;
48.2;?;Steyn to Maxwell, no run backs to leg and has a swing and a miss to a short delivery;

47.4;2;Ngidi to Maxwell, 2 runs this could be costly, a big full toss which he manages to pull between deep square and long leg...well fielded, Maxwell asks about the no-ball, but the umpires say it's okay;
47.3;1;Ngidi to Cummins, 1 run full outside off, drives firmly but straight to mid-off inside the circle;
47.2;1;Ngidi to Maxwell, 1 run carved out to deep cover;
47.1;2;Ngidi to Maxwell, 2 runs just evades Hendricks in the deep, Maxwell heaved a length ball towards wide long-on. The fielder couldn't quite get there, but does an excellent job to recover and prevent the boundary;
46.6;1;Rabada to Maxwell, 1 run a low full toss, he actually stands still this time and pushes down the ground to keep the strike;
46.5;?;Rabada to Maxwell, no run beaten this time, gives himself too much to the leg side, Rabada keeps it full outside off;
46.5;1w;Rabada to Maxwell, 1 wide follows him with a short ball as he moves to the leg side, it's too short;
46.4;2;Rabada to Maxwell, 2 runs moves over the off side, picks up a length delivery and pulls towards fine leg, a very good tumbling save on the boundary from Ngidi. His knee caught in the turf which is worrying, hope he's okay;
46.3;2;Rabada to Maxwell, 2 runs gets the leg-stump yorker, it's a sweetly-struck drive in response, and they get a couple as cover cuts it off;

46.1;1;Rabada to Maxwell, 1 run short, huge swing to the leg side, flies off the top edge towards third man and he loses the strike again;

45.5;?;Ngidi to Cummins, no run swing and miss outside off, another full one, maybe not quite the yorker this time...four dots in a row;
45.4;?;Ngidi to Cummins, no run another yorker on target outside off, he can't make contact, and this is brilliant from Ngidi;
45.3;?;Ngidi to Cummins, no run fantastic yorker, such skill, fired in just outside off stump and Cummins plays over it;
45.2;?;Ngidi to Cummins, no run full outside off, swing and miss, another valuable dot ball;
45.1;1;Ngidi to Maxwell, 1 run excellent delivery, gets the yorker in at off stump, all Maxwell can do is squirt it to backward point;
44.6;W;Steyn to Carey, OUT edged, caught behind! Carey backing away to leg then tried to carve through the off side, could only get a top edge through to de Kock. More reward for the excellent Steyn;Alex Carey c ?de Kock b Steyn 42 (41b 1x4 1x6) SR: 102.43;

44.1;1;Steyn to Carey, 1 run back of a length, straight, hitting the pitch hard, played to the off side;
43.6;?;Rabada to Maxwell, no run they have called for a review here, Maxwell moved right across his stumps and it was a yorker heading to leg stump which glanced the boot as it went through to de Kock. Ah, it actually glanced the pad and is missing another set of stumps. But it's a dot ball;
43.5;?;Rabada to Maxwell, no run ah, well bowled, defeats him with a slower ball, short of a length, and he's through his shot far too early;
43.4;2;Rabada to Maxwell, 2 runs full toss outside leg, he's back away and drives to long-off. They do well to get two there;
43.3;1;Rabada to Carey, 1 run round the wicket, low full toss, flicked to midwicket on the edge of the circle. Hits with the throw, they try to steal an extra run but it's not on;
43.2;1;Rabada to Maxwell, 1 run full and straight, good ball, driven into the off side;
43.1;4;Rabada to Maxwell, FOUR runs power from Maxwell, it just a fraction short outside off, fetched over midwicket with a stinging pull shot;
42.6;1;Ngidi to Maxwell, 1 run full outside off, carved to deep cover;
42.6;1w;Ngidi to Maxwell, 1 wide oh, well, think that may be a harsh wide call. Maxwell backs miles outside leg, Ngidi bowled it wide outside off but it went over the marker the umpire uses. Yeah, tough call I reckon for the bowler;
42.5;1;Ngidi to Carey, 1 run gets the yorker in, straight, dug out down the ground;
42.4;2;Ngidi to Carey, 2 runs dropped at fine leg by Pretorius! Not an easy chance. A big top edge as Carey pulled at a slower ball. He never looked steady coming in and shelled it close to the ground. Had no base for the catch;
42.3;1;Ngidi to Maxwell, 1 run another big full toss, Maxwell moving all over the crease, the ball thuds into the top of his leg and rebounds away. There's an ask for lbw...far too high;

41.5;1;Pretorius to Maxwell, 1 run full outside off, driven powerfully to the sweeper;
41.4;4;Pretorius to Maxwell, FOUR runs what a way to get off the mark as he swivels on a pull, takes the ball from outside off to split long leg and deep square;
41.3;1;Pretorius to Carey, 1 run short, angled into the hip, pulled to deep square;
41.2;W;Pretorius to Marsh, OUT taken at deep midwicket! Marsh can't beyond his ton. Massive, massive moment. That came down with snow on it. A short-of-a-length delivery, Marsh was aiming to clear the leg side again but could only send it high into the night sky. Klaasen had an age to think about the catch as it came, but held on securely;Shaun Marsh c Klaasen b Pretorius 106 (102b 7x4 4x6) SR: 103.92;
41.1;1;Pretorius to Carey, 1 run round the wicket, short of a length, shoveled to deep midwicket;

39.6;1;Pretorius to Marsh, 1 run full outside off, gets forward and drives into the covers but can't beat the man on the edge of the circle. Marsh to 98;
39.5;1;Pretorius to Carey, 1 run just back of a length, a heave to the leg side and there's not much timing...more swift work at deep square;
39.4;1;Pretorius to Marsh, 1 run fuller at off stump, bunted down the ground to long-on;
39.3;1;Pretorius to Carey, 1 run drives at a length delivery, opens the face and runs it to third man;

36.6;1w;Steyn to Marsh, 1 wide a short ball just down the leg side, Marsh doesn't connect with a pull and gets the wide call. So close to his hip;

36.4;1;Steyn to Carey, 1 run back of a length, angled to third man;

36.1;?;Steyn to Carey, no run full and straight, 142kph, played into the on side;

35.3;1;Ngidi to Carey, 1 run back of a length at off stump, angled behind point to third man;
35.2;?;Ngidi to Carey, no run a very tough chance as this is drilled back at Ngidi, who gets his right hand down to it. Got to say that saved a boundary. Came back so fast;
