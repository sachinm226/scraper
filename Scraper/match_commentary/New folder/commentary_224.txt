1.24pm That wicket also brings out the declaration. The Australia players shake Azhar's hand. He wlaks off with his bat in the air, acknowledging the applause. Viv Richards' 208 remains the highest by a non-Australia Test batsman at the MCG. Hazlewood leads Australia off the ground. So in 10 minutes Australia will begin their response. Their target: get 244, avoid follow-on and that should go a long way to save the Test

125.4;2;Starc to Azhar Ali, 2 runs there it is. Just the fourth double-century by a batsman visiting the MCG. Short of a length, angling in, tucked away for two. He sets off for a big leap after finishing his second, removes his helmet and lets out a big scream. Wahab gives him a big hug. The team-mates give him a rousing ovation. Then he does the sajda and puts his helmet back on;
125.3;1;Starc to Wahab Riaz, 1 run full and fast again, and Wahab does his job. Pushes this past cover. They could have taken two but settle with one. The crowd doesn't like it;

124.1;?;Hazlewood to Azhar Ali, no run on a length, straight, pushed to mid-on;
123.6;4;Starc to Sohail Khan, FOUR runs and the last ball before lunch is full and down leg. He gets a touch of the pad and will gladly take the four leg-byes. Oh in fact the umpire rules he has hit it too. All the better for Sohail;
123.5;4;Starc to Sohail Khan, FOUR runs short ans wide, and he has spanked this away wide of gully. This is a proper thrashing. I don't see why they should declare at lunch. Get 500 and look to bat just once;

123.1;4;Starc to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs lovely shot. As much as the brute force of Sohail has entertained us, this is as good as batting gets. Short of a length, angling in towards off, he arches his back to give himself some space, and then steers it between second slip and gully;
122.6;?;Lyon to Sohail Khan, no run stays back to defend an offbreak that is not in his driving zone;

120.5;2;Lyon to Sohail Khan, 2 runs dropped by Warner. The strong wind might have something to do with it.

Not even close to catching it;
120.4;6;Lyon to Sohail Khan, SIX runs this is a lovely clean strike. Lyon flights this one to see if the tail-ender is up for it. Sohail languidly lofts this over long-on for a six. Beautiful connection. This is his Test best;

118.3;?;Lyon to Sohail Khan, no run sharp offbreak again, but starts too straight. Sohail is deemed not to be playing a shot so he doesn't get leg-byes. I don't think I agree with Umpire Ravi there. Only recently I saw R Ashwin get away with worse;

 Innings Start
12.04pm Australia have declared. Pakistan will have tricky 16 minutes to negotiate before lunch. With this not-out, Smith ends 0.1 behind Bert Suttcliffe on overall averages and just five unbeaten runs short of Bradman's average at MCG. That doesn't matter, though. This is a perfect declaration. Pakistan have to bat for four overs or so before lunch, and then two sessions to go. Trailing by 181, they will be denied the confidence you can draw from having drawn level, which is when every run scored means the opposition will have to come back and score it
Yobo: "I wish I was as technically poor as Smith. "

137.4;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run looks for the reverse sweep from outside leg. Beaten;

131.6;?;Sohail Khan to Starc, no run short of a length, on off, defended to mid-off;
131.5;4;Sohail Khan to Starc, FOUR runs glorious pull shot to bring up his fifty. Not a long hop, but Starc is expecting something short. He sits back in the crease, and pulls this through midwicket;

131.3;1;Sohail Khan to Starc, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, tucked away for a single;
131.2;?;Sohail Khan to Starc, no run good comeback. On a length, middle and off, slight seam away, and Starc is beaten. He is either hitting them out of the screws or missing them altogether;
131.1;4;Sohail Khan to Starc, FOUR runs Sohail gets the pace up to 135ks, but he overpitches it and is creamed down the ground for four. Between the stumps and mid-on. Starc's first four;

129.4;3;Sohail Khan to Smith, 3 runs short and wide, cut away, misfielded at point, and Smith steals the second. Then the throw from third man at the bowler's end is wide. The backing up is not good. Azhar the culprit here. They get three when it really should have been one;

128.5;1;Wahab Riaz to Smith, 1 run shuffles across, takes this from outside off, bunts it into the leg side;

128.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Starc, no run into the shoulder. This is a good spell from Wahab. This bouncer is right at him. With no room to do anything, Starc looks to fend. Too high for the fend, misses the gloves and hits the shoulder;

128.1;?;Wahab Riaz to Starc, no run sharp. Length ball at 144ks. Starc has no feet here and just pushes at it. Beaten. Yet again;

124.3;?;Wahab Riaz to Starc, no run short of a length, just outside off, defended;
124.2;?;Wahab Riaz to Starc, no run good sharp short ball. Into the armpit. Starc fends. Is hit on the arm guard for sure but does it kiss the glove on the way. It is not too far from the glove, I tell you, but misses it. Caught by Sarfraz but Starc survives. No appeal at all anyway;
124.1;?;Wahab Riaz to Starc, no run short, straight, chest high, fended down by Starc;
123.6;?;Sohail Khan to Smith, no run short of a length, wide, Smith shuffles across to cut but can't reach it;

121.1;?;Amir to Smith, no run short of a length, outside off, defended to cover;
120.6;?;Yasir Shah to Starc, no run tries another big slog but is beaten outside off;
120.5;6;Yasir Shah to Starc, SIX runs fourth six for Starc. Wrong'un but doesn't matter. It is full enough for Starc to swing at, and he lofts this over wide long-on. What clean golf swings we are witnessing;
120.4;?;Yasir Shah to Starc, no run looks like the wrong'un. Pitches middle, defended outside off by Starc;
120.3;?;Yasir Shah to Starc, no run on a length, on the pads, defended to leg;
120.2;6;Yasir Shah to Starc, SIX runs the big wind-up again. Yasir pitches this too full and too straight, and Starc goes square as opposed to his earlier two cow corner hits. Clears square leg. Six No. 3;

119.6;?;Amir to Smith, no run quicker one here. Short of a length, 144ks, fizzing across the stumps. Smith looks for the cut and is beaten. Head-high collection for Sarfraz. First maiden of the day;

119.2;?;Amir to Smith, no run short of a length, wide, punched hard but straight to backward point;
119.1;?;Amir to Smith, no run Smith shuffles across because Amir has been bowling wide with a strong off-side field. Aborts the thought of playing into the leg side as this is still too wide;
118.6;1;Yasir Shah to Smith, 1 run flighted outside off, played with an open face, gets a single wide of cover;
118.5;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run nice dipping legbreak, just outside off. Defended off the front foot;
118.4;1;Yasir Shah to Starc, 1 run oh Starc. When he mistimes he mistimes it so badly it doesn't carry to the boundary fielder. Tries another slog, the ball doesn't quite come on, and he toe-ends it towards deep midwicket. Lands short, though;
118.3;2;Yasir Shah to Starc, 2 runs too short again, punched between the two men deep on the leg side for a couple;
118.2;?;Yasir Shah to Starc, no run short, a touch wide, Yasir is lucky Starc has found one of the three men on the off side. Punches this straight to cover;

116.3;?;Yasir Shah to Starc, no run flatter, shorter, defended to leg;
116.2;6;Yasir Shah to Starc, SIX runs Starc has seen enough. Gets one up in his zone, clears the front leg, and boom, he sends this over cow corner. Might even be a wrong'un. What a clean swing of the bat;
116.1;?;Yasir Shah to Starc, no run turning into the pads from round the wicket. Defended towards mid-on;
115.6;?;Amir to Smith, no run wide length ball, Smith stands upright, looking to drive it through the covers. The ball doesn't quite come on, and he ends up pushing it to mid-off;
115.5;1;Amir to Starc, 1 run what does Amir need to get a wicket? He draws another edge. With the short ball this time as Starc fends in front of his chest but it falls safe where gully would have been;
115.4;?;Amir to Starc, no run short ball at 140ks, Starc is early into the pull and is hit on the rear arm after he is through with the shot;
115.3;?;Amir to Starc, no run bouncer, 138ks, just outside off, Starc stays away from it;
115.2;?;Amir to Starc, no run slightly short of a length, around that off stump again, punched down to mid-off;

114.1;?;Yasir Shah to Starc, no run flighted outside off, defended back to him;
113.6;4;Sohail Khan to Smith, FOUR runs Smith makes a superb start to day five. Sohail bowls a loosener to complete the overnight over. Short of a length, wide, Smith punches this crisply through cover-point;
113.5;1;Sohail Khan to Starc, 1 run short of a length, outside off, pushed towards point. A misfield allows them a single;
113.4;3;Sohail Khan to Smith, 3 runs short and wide, Smith reaches it with a ladder and cuts it away forward of point. Matches Warner with century No. 17. Removes his helmet after finishing the third, kisses the badge, raises his bat, soaks in the moment;

113.2;?;Sohail Khan to Smith, no run short of a length, outside off, punched to cover;

111.4;?;Sohail Khan to Starc, no run bouncer, middle and leg, 128ks, Starc stays under it;
111.3;W;Sohail Khan to Wade, OUT Sohail has another. This is not the best ball but he will take this wicket. Short and wide. Just a little fuller than cutting length, and just not wide enough perhaps. Wade arches back to cut, gets a healthy edge and Shafiq takes a smart catch at first slip;Matthew Wade c Asad Shafiq b Sohail Khan 9 (36m 27b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
111.2;?;Sohail Khan to Wade, no run short of a length, outside off, punched to point;

110.6;1;Yasir Shah to Wade, 1 run worked into the leg side, with the turn, for a single;
110.5;?;Yasir Shah to Wade, no run is there an edge? Short of a length, outside off, quick, doesn't turn as much as he expects it to, and also bounces more. Sarfraz doesn't collect it clean, and the deflection falls short of slip. No edge, though;
110.4;?;Yasir Shah to Wade, no run flatter, just outside off, defended back to him;
110.3;?;Yasir Shah to Wade, no run flighted outside off. Slower through the air. Higher. Defended off the front foot;

109.2;?;Sohail Khan to Smith, no run wide length ball, left alone;
109.1;4;Sohail Khan to Smith, FOUR runs short and wide. At 125ks. Deserves to go for four. Just that it chooses a new route. Through fine leg off the inside edge;
108.6;?;Yasir Shah to Wade, no run flighted outside off and defended back to him;
108.5;?;Yasir Shah to Wade, no run long hop. And leggies tend to get wickets with those. This one isn't though. Pulled into the helmet of short leg and lobs up for a catch. Next October onwards this will be out but it isn't now. It has hit Azhar Ali smack on the head. Hard enough for it to lob as far as short fine leg. Azhar is sitting up now but he is getting attention. Azhar looks fine for now, but surely he will be tested for a concussion. Surely he should walk off for a few minutes? Wade apologises. Azhar acknowledges the apology. Azhar is walking off the field. Good to see he doesn't need any help to walk off;
108.4;1;Yasir Shah to Smith, 1 run tossed up, middle and leg, pushed to long-on;
108.3;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run tossed up, middle and leg, turning towards off. Defended back to him;

107.1;4;Sohail Khan to Smith, FOUR runs short ball at 126ks. Smith is awake to the loosener. Pulls it between the two men in the deep. Smith reaches 1000 for 2016. Seven men have managed that;
106.6;?;Yasir Shah to Wade, no run short, but turns in sharply to cramp him up;
106.5;2;Yasir Shah to Wade, 2 runs short of a length, goes back to work it into the gap on the leg side for a couple;

104.4;?;Yasir Shah to Wade, no run flighted outside off, defended back to him;
104.3;W;Yasir Shah to Maddinson, OUT bowled him. Shah gets the field right and does Maddinson in. Maddinson leaves the crease to cover the turn on this flighted legbreak outside off. This is a ball the previous fields didn't let him bowl. Now he does. Maddinson not to the pitch of the ball, and it spins past his outside edge. Not as much turn as he expects here. Shane Warne points to a scrambles seam, which might suggest Shah intended to not turn it big;Nic Maddinson b Yasir Shah 22 (77m 55b 2x4 0x6) SR: 40;
104.2;?;Yasir Shah to Maddinson, no run on a length, just outside off, defended in front of his body;
104.1;?;Yasir Shah to Maddinson, no run full, outside off, can't beat point. That extra man helps now;
103.6;?;Wahab Riaz to Smith, no run wide length ball, left alone;
103.5;2;Wahab Riaz to Smith, 2 runs another square drive. How does he manage it? Plays away from the body, opens the face, and beats the man at point to his left to take a couple;
103.4;?;Wahab Riaz to Smith, no run fuller, closer to off, pushed to mid-off;
103.3;4;Wahab Riaz to Smith, FOUR runs full and wide. Smith's square drive. It is a thing of wonder. He doesn't get close to it, he stands upright, and he still middles it. This is not the first one either. Beats third man to his right;
103.2;1;Wahab Riaz to Maddinson, 1 run full and straight. Just short of being a yorker. Worked away into the leg side;
103.1;?;Wahab Riaz to Maddinson, no run on a length, outside off, defended off the front foot. Hit on the high part of the bat;
102.6;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run on a length, middle and leg, defended back to Shah;

102.2;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run this one is slightly fuller, and Smith pushes forward to defend;

100.5;?;Yasir Shah to Smith, no run not much turn on this, negotiated easily;

Peter: "Also for those wondering about Amir's bad luck since his comeback to international cricket - there's a YouTube video for that!"
 Innings Start
What a finish. Sometimes Test cricket shakes out of a slumber. Today was one such day. That's all we have got for you as of now. Messrs Samiuddin, Coverdale and Kimber will have more for sure. Not to forget Mel Farrell. As Nathan Lyon sings Under The Southern Cross, as Australia celebrate this amazing win, this is Sidharth Monga leaving you thinking of a champion cricket fighting doubts at the twilight of his career. The 42-year-old Misbah, the rock that this Pakistan team's resurgence is built on. Through scandals and upheavals, through triumphs and disaster, through controversies and conspiracies, Misbah-ul-Haq has been the only constant, calming everything and everybody down. Today he played two premeditated sweeps to cap up a Test of poor field sets for Yasir Shah with. You always wonder when an old cricketer leaves the crease...
"It's been a pretty good day," says Steve Smith, also the Man of the Match. "At the start of the day we thought of batting for 40 minutes and see how it goes. We didn't lose any wickets so we put our foot down. Starcy's hits gave us the opportunity to take the 180 lead and go after them. We thought if we were able to get it to reverse soon enough, we could win. Also Lyono bowled so well before the ball started to go. At about five down when the ball was swinging, the bowlers were fresh, that's when it started to look clear. It's an unbelievable feeling to see the boys in that huddle. Pretty surreal to have now wrapped up the series. We have got a lot of belief in the guys around. The guys are doing the hard yards to improve every day. It has been a great sort of transition. I am proud of how the guys came out today to win the Test. I am doing okay. I have felt for a while that I have been hitting them all right. I love batting at MCG. Been a happy hunting ground for me. Can't wait to go to SCG. I like it there too, hopefully I can make it three in a row."
"Think especially after getting 443 in the first innings," says Misbah-ul-Haq. "we could not bowl to any discipline, could not build any pressure. We lost all the momentum there. Full credit to the Australian batsmen. It's a funny game. Especially when you are under pressure. When you know there can only be a draw or a defeat, that can create a lots of problems. We thought it might be easy if we could get a couple of wickets early. Anything over 100, you never know on the final day. We knew anything could happen. Azhar has been outstanding. The ball was doing a lot in the first innings. Seaming and swinging. Loads of concentration. In the second innings, under pressure.. Also Asad Shafiq played really well. Srafraz too. In the end you have to win sessions. You have to play well over both innings. That's what we haven't been able to manage. You have to forget these kind of performances and stand up as a team."
Australia in a huddle. This has been some win. We have had three days and two sessions of play. Pakistan made 450 in the first innings. Still Australia have won. They batted with intensity. Despite all the rain and the Pakistan runs, Australia kept thinking of the win. They enjoyed some luck when Warner batted but the intensity never dropped. You saw plays and misses but every time you looked up at the scoreboard Warner had added 20 more. Smith then followed it up with a calculated hundred that took him past the Test average of 60. Pakistan meanwhile remained lacklustre. Were they complacent thinking of the rain? They were sloppy in the field on the final morning, allowing Australia to make the declaration before lunch. Australia were switched on from ball one. Pakistan fans will poignantly look back at that Misbah innings
"It has finished a lot better than it started," Starc says. "We kept trying to find a way to win. We always had the belief. We knew if we took our chances we were confident of creating 10 chances. We knew we only had two sessions. Together as a bowling group we did really well. Just tried to hang out with Smitty and have a good time."
"Unbelievable," says Handscomb. "Great start to a Test career. Our motto today was to come out and keep believing. Second catch (Shafiq) was a bit lucky. Just moved with the shot, but on another day it would have fallen elsewhere. Amazing. Great experience to be in front of this crowd. To come out here and sing the anthems on the Boxing Day."
"Pretty special," says Lyon. "The bowling unit stood up today. The credit goes to all the boys. Smitty is a really good captain. We love playing under him. We want to go out and win three-nil now. We want to turn up to Sydney and try hard. We thought we had to do something special. Credit to the boys who held the catches. Doesn't matter who is taking the wickets, we just go out to take 20 wickets as a team. It's all about belief. I learnt it against India in Adelaide two years ago."
"Unbelievable," says Hazlewood. "Rocking up today we didn't know what to expect. Pretty good wicket. Doesn't really break up. Reverse swing from us was the key. We did end up getting the wickets pretty quickly. The plan was to crack one end up. Tight turnaround this Test but the body is feeling really good."
53.2;W;Starc to Yasir Shah, OUT all ovah. Starc ends it. The shine is on the outside. Full, on the pads, Yasir looks to work on the leg side, but the ball swings away late, takes a hefty leading edge for an easy catch for Bird at mid-on;Yasir Shah c Bird b Starc 0 (12m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
53.1;?;Starc to Yasir Shah, no run Starc gives Shah a bouncer first up. Down the leg side. Flicks his arm on the way;
52.6;?;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, no run on a length, on off, defended back to him. And we will have the last hour;
52.5;?;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, no run bouncer, he gets under it. Now where does he gets the single to keep the strike?;
52.4;4;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, FOUR runs lovely off drive on the up. Past Hazlewood before he gets down, and beats Warner at mid-off too. Deficit under 20, but does it matter now?;
52.3;?;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, no run big swipe to a length ball. Into the shin of short leg;
52.2;?;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, no run full, swinging in, defended back;
52.1;?;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, no run on a length, outside off, pushed to cover, turns down the single;
51.6;?;Starc to Yasir Shah, no run nope, not just yet. Yasir defends a straight full ball back to Starc;
51.5;W;Starc to Wahab Riaz, OUT Starc is too good. Hits the off stump again. He did a repeat of Chris Lewis last over, has he done an Allan Lamb here? Beats the outside edge with the slight tail away from Wahab. This is going to hurt Pakistan more because this is what they used to do to opponents;Wahab Riaz b Starc 0 (8m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
51.4;?;Starc to Wahab Riaz, no run yorker at 144ks, in front off, dug out to Starc. Such a shame there aren't 60000 people at the MCG cheering him on as he charges in;
51.3;?;Starc to Wahab Riaz, no run full, straight, defended in front of middle and leg;
51.2;?;Starc to Wahab Riaz, no run full, just outside off, swinging away late. Wahab is late and playing down the wrong line. Pakistan getting a taste of their own medicine. This is as good as Akram;
51.1;?;Starc to Wahab Riaz, no run full, fast, outside off. Beaten by the away movement;
50.6;?;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, no run bouncer, he ducks it;
50.5;?;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, no run length ball, outside off, defended to mid-off;
50.4;?;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, no run short of a length, just outside off, defended;
50.3;?;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, no run bouncer from Hazlewood. Sohail ducks under it;
50.2;2;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, 2 runs this one swings back in, Sohail gets a thick inside edge and takes a couple. That back lift with the ball reversing will encourage Australia;
50.1;4;Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, FOUR runs expectedly now Sohail starts to swing about. Gets a thick edge to a length ball. Between the slips and gully for four;
49.6;W;Starc to Sarfaraz, OUT Starc has broken the game open. This is the old Pakistan treatment given to Pakistan. Think of Wasim Akram bowling Chris Lewis at the same venue all those years ago. All over Starc has been swinging it away from Sarfraz. Now he reverses the shiny side. It is now facing the batsman. This is quick, this is on target and this snakes back in. Through the gap between bat and pad. Top of off. This is genius;Sarfaraz Ahmed b Starc 43 (96m 62b 4x4 0x6) SR: 69.35;
49.5;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run short of a length, down the leg side. Sarfraz is so concerned about that off and around that off stump, he misses out on this;
49.4;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run goes for the yorker at 141ks. Sarfraz keeps it out;
49.3;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run oh it is reversing properly now. On a length, outside off, bends away with the shine. Sarfraz has to play the angle. Beaten;
49.2;4;Starc to Sarfaraz, FOUR runs and it goes between the second and the fourth slip. Sarfraz defends a length ball outside off, gets a thick edge but it goes wide of the diving Smith. Wouldn't have carried to the third slip anyway. Deficit under 30;
49.1;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run on a length, on off, defended solidly;
48.6;?;Bird to Sohail Khan, no run another big winding back lift to defend a full ball back to Bird;
48.5;?;Bird to Sohail Khan, no run on a length, headed for top of off, 138ks, defended back. That back lift from Sohail, though. Big and winding;
48.4;1;Bird to Sarfaraz, 1 run full and straight, tailing in a little, Sarfraz takes a single off the inside half of the bat;
48.3;2;Bird to Sarfaraz, 2 runs short of a length, wide, guided wide of point for a couple more;
48.2;2;Bird to Sarfaraz, 2 runs full, outside off, driven in front of deep cover, and he starts the third and decides midway to go back. Sarfraz not happy with slow running from Sohail. Perhaps Sohail thinks he will be protected by Sarfraz so early in the over;
48.1;?;Bird to Sarfaraz, no run on a length, straight, headed for middle. Defended back to him;
47.6;?;Lyon to Sohail Khan, no run nice dip outside off. Defended from the crease;
47.5;?;Lyon to Sohail Khan, no run shuffles across to defend a slow offbreak outside off;
47.4;1;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 1 run short of a length, goes back to punch it past midwicket;
47.3;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run stays back to defend a length ball;
47.2;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run nice dip on this. Sarfraz's back lift is high but he has to play defensively because of the dip;
47.1;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run tossed up outside off, defended back to Lyon;
46.6;?;Bird to Sohail Khan, no run full and straight first up. Defended back to him;
46.5;W;Bird to Amir, OUT and Bird has got the length right this over. He has bowled Amir. This has been an excellent over. The ball has been tailing away against the angle from round the wicket this over. Amir has left one but he is not sure because of the angle. Here he decides to play at it, the ball moves away and he has to follow it with his hands. Doesn't react fast enough, gets an inside edge onto his body and then onto the stumps. The umpire checks Bird's front foot, but he is fine. Amir is on his way after playing an important hand;Mohammad Amir b Bird 11 (55m 39b 1x4 0x6) SR: 28.2;
46.4;?;Bird to Amir, no run full, down the leg side, tailing away. Amir misses out on runs. Wade flies to his right to save four byes;
46.3;?;Bird to Amir, no run big big shout, called not-out and Australia are reviewing this. Length ball, angling in, nips back in, misses the inside edge, hits the flap of the pad and goes through to Wade. They have appealed for an inside edge here, but there is no bat involved. Also bouncing over the stumps so no lbw either;
46.2;?;Bird to Amir, no run what a leave. This pitches around the fifth stump and straightens. A brave call to not play that angle;
46.1;1;Bird to Sarfaraz, 1 run short of a length, into the pads, tucked away to long leg;
45.6;?;Lyon to Amir, no run full, on off, easy to defend;
45.5;?;Lyon to Amir, no run on a length, no turn, goes straight on, hits the inside edge onto the pad, but doesn't pop up;
45.4;?;Lyon to Amir, no run this one doesn't turn. Pitches middle, angles into the pads, runs off the inside edge past short leg;
45.3;?;Lyon to Amir, no run short of a length, outside off, punched to cover;
45.2;?;Lyon to Amir, no run some turn, from just outside off, hits the outside edge but it dies right away;
45.1;?;Lyon to Amir, no run on a length, dipping in front of off. Defended back to Lyon;
44.6;1;Bird to Amir, 1 run short of a length, into the body, worked square on the leg side. Deficit under 40 now;
44.5;?;Bird to Amir, no run another goes past the edge. Again just short of a length and around off. He has to play the angle, but the ball moves away with the shiny side to beat the edge;
44.4;2;Bird to Amir, 2 runs short of a length, angling in, nicely steered past the slips for a sharp second. This is the urgency that was missing earlier in the innings;
44.3;?;Bird to Amir, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
44.2;3;Bird to Sarfaraz, 3 runs half-volley outside off, driven between mid-off and cover, gets three more. Warner asked to chase some more;
44.1;?;Bird to Sarfaraz, no run short of a length, outside off, punched to point;
43.6;?;Lyon to Amir, no run on a length, outside off, left alone;
43.5;2;Lyon to Amir, 2 runs lovely square drive. Just a touch fuller than the previous deliveries that he defended. Past point it goes for a couple;
43.4;?;Lyon to Amir, no run slightly short but sits in the surface and bounces, which means Amir has to abort designs of a forceful shot;
43.3;?;Lyon to Amir, no run past the edge. Lyon slows it down, gets some dip, Amir not to its pitch when he defends, Has his outside edge beaten;
43.2;?;Lyon to Amir, no run flighted outside off, driven square, with the turn, to cover-point;
43.1;?;Lyon to Amir, no run length ball, slight turn, defended in front of off;
42.6;?;Bird to Sarfaraz, no run bouncer. Designed perhaps to keep Amir on strike for the first ball of the next over. And Lyon shall have Amir now;
42.5;2;Bird to Sarfaraz, 2 runs short of a length, outside off, and a lovely punch off the back foot, in front of point;
42.4;?;Bird to Sarfaraz, no run on a length, angling into the pads, defended to leg;
42.3;?;Bird to Sarfaraz, no run bouncer at 132ks, Sarfraz ducks under it;
42.2;4;Bird to Sarfaraz, FOUR runs short of a length, wide, Sarfraz waits for it to arrive and then steers it between slips and gully. Deficit under 50 now;
42.1;?;Bird to Sarfaraz, no run on a length, outside off, driven on the up, straight to cover;
41.6;?;Lyon to Amir, no run full, middle and leg, defended to leg;
41.5;1;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 1 run flat outside off, 99ks, pushed wide of mid-off for a single;
41.4;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run on a length, dipping outside off, defended back to him;
41.3;4;Lyon to Sarfaraz, FOUR runs swept away again. This team he beats that short fine leg to his left. Again sweeps down on it and by the leg umpire;
41.2;?;Lyon to Sarfaraz, no run swept away from outside off. Right into the pitch. Fielded at short fine leg;
41.1;4;Lyon to Sarfaraz, FOUR runs half-volley outside off, and driven through the vacant cover region. Important to take all the runs on offer. Deficit under 60;
40.6;?;Bird to Amir, no run wide length ball, left alone;
40.5;?;Bird to Amir, no run beats the edge. Lovely bowling. On a length, just outside off, seams away as Amir has to play for the angle. So unlucky to not take the edge;
40.4;4;Bird to Amir, FOUR runs full and wide, Amir squeezes this past the diving Lyon at point. That's four crucial runs;
40.3;?;Bird to Amir, no run on a length, angling in, defended from the crease;
40.2;?;Bird to Amir, no run full, outside off, pushed to cover-point;
40.1;1;Bird to Sarfaraz, 1 run length ball, on off, shapes back in a little, takes the inside edge on the big drive. They think of a second but decide against it. Just in the nick of time;
39.6;?;Starc to Amir, no run short of a length, middle and leg, and nicely negotiated;
39.5;1;Starc to Sarfaraz, 1 run on a length, angling in, worked past short leg. Gets the single. Amir has to face just one ball this over;
39.4;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run wide length ball, angling in, but not enough to make him play;
39.3;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run on a length, outside off, solidly defended followed by a loud call of "waiting";
39.2;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run short of a length, down the leg side. Left alone;

38.5;?;Hazlewood to Amir, no run on a length, outside off, left alone.Not enough angle;
38.4;?;Hazlewood to Amir, no run short of a length, on off, angling away. Left alone;
38.3;3;Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, 3 runs lovely shot. Driven on the up,wide of mid-off, and Warne chases like a bulldog again. Saves one run. Deficit under 70 now;
38.2;?;Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, no run short of a length, angling in, hits the thigh pad;
38.1;?;Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, no run on a length, on off, defended back to him;
37.6;?;Starc to Amir, no run inside edge. Amir survives. A low, really low, full toss at 149ks. Bang on off. Amir just about gets the inside edge onto the pad;
37.5;?;Starc to Amir, no run yorker - like Amir bowled a few to Starc - but down the leg side;
37.4;3;Starc to Sarfaraz, 3 runs half-volley, Sarfraz alert to it, and drives it through covers for three. Warner gives a quick chase and saves one;
37.3;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run edged and short of gully. Handscomb absolutely sensational everywhere in the field. Sarfraz looks to open the face, can't keep it down. This is short and wide of gully but Handscomb saves four with a full-length dive;
37.2;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run wide length ball, left alone;
37.1;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run low full toss, pushed to cover;
36.6;?;Hazlewood to Amir, no run length ball, middle and off, stays back to defend it;
36.5;?;Hazlewood to Amir, no run on a length, outside off, left alone;
36.4;?;Hazlewood to Amir, no run on a length, shaping away. Looks like Amir has pushed at it, but he keeps his bat inside the line;
36.3;1;Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, 1 run on a length, outside off, pushes wide of cover with soft hands. Sarfraz takes the single. You can see the urgency in the batting now;
36.2;?;Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, no run on a length, just outside off, defended off the front foot;
36.1;?;Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, no run on a length, shaping back in, defended back to him;
35.6;?;Starc to Amir, no run on a length, angling in, Amir defends this to short leg;
35.5;?;Starc to Amir, no run uppish square drive. A push really. Away from the body. Falls in front of point;
35.4;1;Starc to Sarfaraz, 1 run on a length, angling in, pushed past short leg for one;
35.3;2;Starc to Sarfaraz, 2 runs on a length, on the pads, worked away past short leg, and comes back for a quick second. That is the urgency Pakistan need. That is the urgency that has been lacking;
35.2;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run full and wide, Sarfraz lets it go through to Wade;
35.1;?;Starc to Sarfaraz, no run bouncer at 143ks, over the leg stump. Sarfraz ducks it;
34.6;2;Hazlewood to Amir, 2 runs short of a length, outside off, runs this past gully;
34.5;?;Hazlewood to Amir, no run on a length, pretty straight, defended from the crease;
34.4;W;Hazlewood to Azhar Ali, OUT this one stays low. I think he has got him, but Azhar will review the lbw call. Uneven bounce for perhaps the first time in the Test and it has caught Azhar in front. Short of a length, nips in a little, stays low, and Azhar is caught in front. He is on his toes, deep in the crease and is hit on the flap of the pad. He is the best batsman. He has to review this. The tracking shows the ball clipping the top of the stumps. Umpires call then. So out it is, and they have finally got Azhar out. This could be it for this Test;Azhar Ali lbw b Hazlewood 43 (156m 112b 3x4 0x6) SR: 38.39;

33.3;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run on a length, left alone outside off. Still good carry. Wade collects it by his head;
33.2;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run back to concentrating then. Wide length ball, left alone;
33.1;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run wide and full, a rare play and miss from Azhar. Tries the drive, and is beaten;

32.1;?;Hazlewood to Azhar Ali, no run short of a length, straight, defended. That's a Cowan for Azhar. Needs another to take Pakistan to safety;

30.6;?;Hazlewood to Azhar Ali, no run on a length, outside off, defended back to him;
30.5;?;Hazlewood to Azhar Ali, no run good short ball. Into the ribs, and Azhar is not expecting it. He fends at it, and is hit on the handle of the bat. He is really lucky this has not lobbed up. Think it has got a bit of his finger on the lower glove too;
30.4;1lb;Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, 1 leg bye on a length, into the pads, beats the inside edge but headed well down the leg side;
30.3;?;Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, no run Hazlewood keeps testing him on that length just outside off. Defended off the front foot;
30.2;?;Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, no run more seam movement from outside off. Sarfraz leaves this alone again, and it decks back in late. is it seam or is it really late swing, which could mean... well... reverse;
30.1;?;Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, no run length ball outside off, left alone. This seams back in a touch. Will cause doubts in Sarfraz's mind;
29.6;1;Lyon to Sarfaraz, 1 run nice dipping offbreak and Sarfraz flicks with hard hands. Uppishly it goes but wide of short leg;
29.5;W;Lyon to Shafiq, OUT Lyon produces another before tea. Is it that field change that has brought about this wicket? He has been defending to off solidly so far, but now with silly mid-off there he leaves his crease. He leaves the crease too early and Lyon shortens the length. He flicks it to leg where Handscomb stays low in his stance. The ball hits the left hand, then the armpit, and then the Handscomb hands come around when the ball is on its downward flight. A good fielding change and a really good catch to follow it up with;Asad Shafiq c Handscomb b Lyon 16 (39m 31b 1x4 0x6) SR: 51.61;

27.5;?;Lyon to Azhar Ali, no run wide half-volley, driven to short cover;

22.3;?;Starc to Shafiq, no run about a set of stumps wide outside off. Left alone. A bit of tail back in. That might raise doubts in Shafiq's mind;

22.1;?;Starc to Shafiq, no run full and wide, left alone;

20.1;?;Bird to Azhar Ali, no run short of a length, on off, defended to leg;
19.6;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run it is all happening. Shafiq steps out, clips it to leg, short leg gets a touch on it, Wade dives on the ball and tires to run him out with a back flick. Phew. Breathless action;
19.5;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run another sharp turning delivery, and he stabs at it. He is lucky it doesn't carry to short leg;
19.4;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run big shout first up. Lovely bowling. Dip and drift outside off, makes Shafiq defend in front of the body, spins it past the inside edge but Shafiq has just about got outside the line of off;
19.3;W;Lyon to Misbah, OUT what is Misbah up to? This is poor Test-match batting. Premeditation. Big-time premeditation. Sweeping everything. And the bounce for Lyon does him in. He sweeps this from outside off but is nowhere close to it, leaving himself prone to the bounce. The top edge is gobbled up at short fine leg;Misbah-ul-Haq c Maddinson b Lyon 0 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
19.2;?;Lyon to Misbah, no run premeditated sweep first up. And this is in front of off. And too full to sweep. They are all excited but the bat comes down in the nick of time;
19.1;W;Lyon to Younis, OUT just when Pakistan were looking a little comfortable, Lyon produces the goods. Extra bounce here. Lyon bowls an offbreak on a length. Younis nowhere near it and pushes at it with his hands. The bounce surprises him. Off the high part of the bat it falls towards short leg where Handscomb takes a smart low catch;Younis Khan c Handscomb b Lyon 24 (66m 37b 2x4 0x6) SR: 64.86;

18.5;?;Bird to Azhar Ali, no run wide length ball, left alone again;
18.4;4;Bird to Azhar Ali, FOUR runs not the best spell from Bird. Down the leg side again. Azhar gets enough of a tickle. Wide of the diving Wade. Actually no touch, only pad. Erroneously called runs by the umpire;

17.3;?;Lyon to Younis, no run nice drift again. Younis has to stretch far out to defend outside off;
17.2;?;Lyon to Younis, no run slightly shorter than the previous ball, which means Younis can't drive. He is forced to defend off the front foot;

15.1;1;Lyon to Azhar Ali, 1 run that's 50 balls faced for Azhar. Clips a full wide ball wide of mid-on for a single;
14.6;?;Bird to Younis, no run on a length, outside off, Younis is forward as he defends;

14.4;?;Bird to Younis, no run short of a length, down the leg side, misses out on runs;
14.3;?;Bird to Younis, no run on a length, just outside off, Younis strides forward to defend. If he starts getting this forward stride right, it is a good sign for Pakistan;

13.1;?;Lyon to Azhar Ali, no run tossed up outside off, defended off the front foot. Not quite to the pitch of the ball;
12.6;?;Bird to Younis, no run on a length, just outside off. This is perfect. Can't drive it, can't steer it. Younis defends away from the body a touch;

11.2;?;Lyon to Younis, no run slightly short as he goes outside off. Defended to short leg;

10.5;?;Bird to Azhar Ali, no run presses forward to defend this one;
10.4;?;Bird to Azhar Ali, no run seams back in and there is an lbw shout. Azhar is caught back to a ball that is between good length and proper short of length. He gets an inside edge but this would have sailed over. He has been just that one foot short than the ideal length;
10.3;?;Bird to Azhar Ali, no run short of a length, straight, worked to square leg;
10.2;?;Bird to Azhar Ali, no run beats him. Bird is on a length and catches him on the back foot. Squares him up as the ball straightens after pitching;

8.6;?;Starc to Azhar Ali, no run good leave. A really good delivery too. Short of a length, just outside off. Azhar thinks he needs to fend at it. But the ball rises alarmingly. Azhar sees it and drops his wrists to watch it through to Wade;
8.5;3;Starc to Younis, 3 runs pitched up. Younis sees it is full enough and goes ahead with the drive although the front foot has not moved. Places it past cover;

7.5;?;Hazlewood to Azhar Ali, no run nearly bowled him. Change-up in length. Short of a length, gets it rib high. Azhar defends with soft hands. The ball falls on the front toe, then hits the feel of the front foot, and ricochets back towards the stumps. Misses by six inches, I suppose;
7.4;?;Hazlewood to Azhar Ali, no run stays on that impeccable line and length. Can't drive it, and you have to play at it because it is close to off. Azhar defends well here;
7.3;1;Hazlewood to Younis, 1 run on a length, angling in, worked around the corner for one;

5.6;?;Hazlewood to Younis, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
5.5;?;Hazlewood to Younis, no run edged but short. What an over this has been from Hazlewood. He is testing them inches outside off stump again. On a length, around that fifth stump, Younis pushes and edges but it doesn't carry to second slip. Soft hands, though;

4.2;1;Starc to Younis, 1 run full, swinging in, clipped away off the toes;
4.1;W;Starc to Babar Azam, OUT got him first ball. A perfect cherry first up. Babar Azam reviews it after a word with Azhar Ali. Perfect swinging ball, on a length, swinging bast the inside edge, no edge. It pitches middle, swings past the bat and hits him in front of leg. Tracking has this clipping leg. Umpire's call. So the original "out" call stays;Babar Azam lbw b Starc 3 (10m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
3.6;?;Hazlewood to Azhar Ali, no run leading edge. Azhar thinks this is full enough to work to leg, but it stops a touch on him. Lands short of point, though;

1.4;W;Hazlewood to Sami Aslam, OUT bowled him. Australia have one out of the ten. This is just tentative from Sami. Just a decent length ball, on off. Sami has to play at it.
