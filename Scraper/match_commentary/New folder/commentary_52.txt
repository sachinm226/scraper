5.47pm Raining again at the MCG. Covers are on. Gnasher says warm-ups are still going on and the big sheet is now being removed. The pitch covers are being pulled off now. Play will resume at 5.55pm. No overs lost. The players are all ready to go.
5.20pm Another underwhelming day for Australia. It's become so common on this tour. Doesn't look like the rain can save them anymore as the weather seems to be holding up fine. They need to bowl seriously well. Not impossible. This is a slowish surface, a bit two-paced and a bit of variable bounce as well. But they will have to pull more than their share of weight with the ball.
India handed out a debut to Vijay Shankar, and he seemed to do fine with his gentle medium pacers, producing nice and accurate lines and keeping it tight. Buvneshwar Kumar set them up for this failure by nipping out the openers in quick time. Finch tried all he could - including standing several yards outside the crease - to counter his swing, but once again fell victim to the inswinger. All he had to show for all that effort were 14 runs. But India's hero with the ball was Yuzvendra Chahal. This was his first game of the series, replacing Kuldeep Yadav, and he's created history. His figures are the best for any bowler in an ODI in Australia. It's a record he shares with Ajit Agarkar. No spinner before Chahal had ever managed to grab six wickets in an ODI in Australia, so this has been a historic day for him.
Australia have managed just 17 boundaries in the 47-odd overs they have bowled. It all paints an ominous sign, really. India's top-order is among the most domineering and overpowering in world cricket. Barring the entire top-order collapsing, this will be uphill for Australia. We'll be back with the chase in due course.
Karthik Rajagop: "I am missing the aggressive attitude and the well known fighting spirit from the Aussies!"
Abbas: "For me, Shami should be the third seamer along with Bhuvi and Bumrah, and Bhuvi and Shami to open with new balls. Shami has shown a great control with the new ball in this series and that's very good for Team INDIA for the world cup."
48.4;W;Shami to Stanlake, OUT and that will be a wrap. Shami pitches it full and straight on a leg stump line, Stanlake closes the face against the line and the ball goes straight through the bat, pings the pad and deflects onto the stumps;Billy Stanlake b Mohammed Shami 0 (2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
48.3;?;Shami to Stanlake, no run fuller of a length, pitches in front of the bat and sneaks underneath before going over the stumps. He was nowhere underneath that;
48.2;1;Shami to Siddle, 1 run full around off, clipped to square leg's right;
48.1;?;Shami to Siddle, no run pitched up on a middle-stump line, pushed back;
47.6;1;Chahal to Siddle, 1 run tucked to square leg;
47.5;?;Chahal to Siddle, no run flighted on middle, Siddle gets forward and carefully blocks back;
47.4;W;Chahal to Zampa, OUT and another one goes. Sixth wicket for Chahal, equals Agarkar's record for most wickets at the MCG by a visiting bowler. This one's nicely looped up and inviting him to come forward. Zampa charges down and swipes big without getting entirely underneath it and holes out to long-on;Adam Zampa c Shankar b Chahal 8 (14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;
47.3;?;Chahal to Zampa, no run shortish, a bit of width, cut to point;
47.2;1;Chahal to Siddle, 1 run sees the flight and goes for an extravgant drive but the ball slides in and takes a thick inside edge to midwicket;

46.4;4;Shami to Siddle, FOUR runs nicely played. Opens the face to a fuller one and steers it fine to the third man boundary;
46.3;2;Shami to Siddle, 2 runs full outside off, pushes into the covers and they jog for the single. Throw fired in at the striker's end. Direct hit would've had him out by miles, I reckon;
46.2;?;Shami to Siddle, no run short ball, barely ducks as it goes over his front shoulder;
46.1;1;Shami to Zampa, 1 run slower short ball, waits on it and slaps it out to deep point;
45.6;W;Chahal to Handscomb, OUT shifts back to a length ball and tries to turn it away into the on side with the angle. But the ball skids on and straightens late to beat the closing face of the bat before pinning him in front of middle. That's plumb as a duck. Handscomb reviews. He's the last recognised batsman and so goes for it. Smashing middle of middle. Five wickets for Chahal.;Peter Handscomb lbw b Chahal 58 (63b 2x4 0x6) SR: 92.06;
45.5;1;Chahal to Zampa, 1 run slower through the air, drilled away between mid-on and midwicket;
45.4;?;Chahal to Zampa, no run has that carried to Chahal? Full and flat on middle, drilled back a tad uppishly, Chahal dives to his right but doesn't hold on;
45.3;2;Chahal to Zampa, 2 runs nicely flighted outside off, reaches out for a lavish drive, lands short of deep cover running to his right;
45.2;?;Chahal to Zampa, no run looped up on middle and off, driven to cover;

44.5;3;Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, 3 runs jabs at this short of a length delivery, tries to hack it over the midwicket boundary but doesn't quite get hold, lands well inside and Dhawan in the deep gets around it;
44.4;1;Bhuvneshwar to Zampa, 1 run short of a length outside off, punched off the backfoot to the sweeper at cover;
44.3;1;Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, 1 run good length outside off, opens the face to third man;

43.5;?;Chahal to Zampa, no run length, spins away, shuffles across and defends down the track;
43.4;?;Chahal to Zampa, no run full outside off, pushed back to the bowler;
43.3;W;Chahal to Jhye Richardson, OUT pays the price for playing against the turn. Nicely looped in towards leg stump, temping him to close the face against the turn. Lands just short enough to muster up some turn and results in the batsman chipping it tamely to short midwicket as he closes the face;Jhye Richardson c Jadhav b Chahal 16 (23b 1x4 0x6) SR: 69.56;
43.2;?;Chahal to Jhye Richardson, no run full and spinning away outside off, pushed out to point;

42.6;2;Shami to Jhye Richardson, 2 runs;
42.5;4;Shami to Jhye Richardson, FOUR runs short on middle and leg, pulled to deep backward square leg. Rayudu dives to his right at the deep but there's another fielder sprinting towards the ball. Seems like a part of his foot might have brushed against Rayudu. Ends up making contact with the boundary as well as he slides towards the ropes still in contact with the ball;
42.4;1;Shami to Handscomb, 1 run shuffles across and punches down to long-on;
42.3;1;Shami to Jhye Richardson, 1 run fuller on off, pushed into the covers for a quick one;

34.5;W;Shami to Maxwell, OUT Maxwell's holed out here. India went in with a clear plan to him. Shami played on his natural instincts to pull and bangs this in short again. Maxwell can't control the hook, gets another thick top-edge, this one sails fine and Bhuvneshwar Kumar latches on brilliantly, sprinting forward from the deep and diving in front for a well-judged catch;Glenn Maxwell c Kumar b Mohammed Shami 26 (19b 5x4 0x6) SR: 136.84;

Short of good length, kicks up a little more than he may have anticipated, and it straightens just enough to shave the outside edge. This time, because of the bounce, it carries to Kohli. Even so, he had to get down full tilt to hold onto it;Alex Carey c Kohli b Kumar 5 (11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 45.45;

1.27pm The covers are off and the players are on. Buckle up, folks. We're ready to go. Bhuvneshwar Kumar with the new ball. He is lethal, generally, in such conditions.
1.20pm The pitch remains covered. Ten-minute delay to the start. We will be udnerway at 1.30pm assuming there are no more interruptions.
Ankit kansal: "Last day of each series (t20, test match and odi) impacted by rain. Hoping today not like test match and t20"
Finch has been reminding himself that 'he's still a very good player.' He'll have to deal with some difficult overcast conditions now to back that up when he comes out to bat in a short while.
India XI: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (capt), MS Dhoni (wk), Kedar Jadhav, Dinesh Karthik, Vijay Shankar, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Yuzvendra Chahal
Australia XI: Alex Carey (wk), Aaron Finch (capt), Usman Khawaja, Shaun Marsh, Peter Handscomb, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, Jhye Richardson, Billy Stanlake, Peter Siddle, Adam Zampa
1pm Toss time! Kohli calls heads and India are bowling.
"It's overcast and it might be stop-start, so as a batsman you may never get momentum," he says. "We have had a good time here. Levelling the series was important, now we want to finish it off with a win. It can get difficult after a Test series like that to get into the zone. I had to step up for the team and MS played superbly as well. Mohammad Siraj is out and we have Vijay Shankar making his debut in his place. Kedar is in for Rayudu, and we have a leggie for a leggie: Chahal replaces Kuldeep."
"I would have bowled first as well," says Aaron Finch. "Jason Behrendorff is dealing with back issues and Billy Stanlake is in for him. And Adam Zampa is in for Nathan Lyon. It might be on the slower side to start with, and with not much sun around, it may not change all that much. Would have liked to bowl first but not all that disappointed. It's all set up for a good series decider."
Vijay Shankar had a miserable time in the T20 Nidahas Trophy final against Bangladesh last year. India triumphed in that final, but amid all the celebrations, Vijay was lost in his own world, probably thinking about he had repeatedly swung and missed against Mustafizur Rahman. He has since put the memory of that final behind him, used the tours with the 'A' team to gain confidence to finish innings in 50-over cricket, and has learnt to cope with pressure better. Deivarayan Muthu tells you the story of India's newest ODI cricketer.
12.49pm Vijay Shankar has been given a debut cap. And the toss has been delayed. If no further rain, it will happen at 1pm.
Kavi: "From Sydney,, it's super hot here about 41 degree in west. Take some heat and give some rain in return. "
APande: "C'mon now fellas... everyone wanted a piece of this engaging series, so did the weather Gods "
Akash Gupta: "I have been waiting for this match for last days, reading all of cricinfo coverage building up my excitement, just to find out about the threat of weather gods, time for all cricket stadiums to have a roof, just like Basketball."
Nick: "Writing in from Slovakia. It's 246am here and if it rains I'm going to be so disappointed! Have even taken the day off for this......." -- Happy waiting!
S Ejaz: "Sunny, rainy, windy, dry, sunny and then rainy again, all in one day....that's Melbourne for you!"
12.36pm Hello all. Good morning, and a very warm welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the third ODI - the final match of a long and engrossing tour of Australia. I am Akshay Gopalakrishnan and I will be joined shortly by Alex Malcolm as we bring today's action to you live.
Both teams are at a stalemate presently, but could we see the ODI series ending in the same manner as the T20Is? The chances sure are there, because Andrew McGlashan reports from the MCG that there have been quite a few heavy showers so far today and we could get another shortly but the forecast is better for later in the day. The covers were in place until a short while ago and neither side was seen warming up. That has only just changed, with the players now having emerged and some of the covers being peeled off. The sky, however, still looks quite threatening at the moment.
For all of Shaun Marsh's struggles in Test cricket, his ODI form has been as good as it's ever been. And for all of MS Dhoni's struggles through much of 2018, the new year has begun in a refreshingly different manner. But where do both teams' concerns truly lie? My colleague Shashank Kishore's preview sets it all up.
 Innings Start
India win by seven wickets with four balls to spare and clinch the series 2-1. MS Dhoni does it again. He left it late but he and Kedar Jadhav panicked last and got it done with an unbeaten 121-run partnership to see India home.
Australia had their chances, but fluffed them. Dropped catches, run out chances missed.. these are traits that aren't usually associated with Australia. But such has been this tour. India have dominated across formats, have undoubtedly been the better team, and deservedly have been crowned winners.
If Cheteshwar Pujara silenced doubters about his ability outside the subcontinent in the Test series, MS Dhoni has done the same in the ODIs to those questioning his age and role in this young Indian outfit. No doubt after this performance that he has a place in this Indian ODI side.
Australia have some ominuos signs ahead of the World Cup. No doubt, they will shored up by the return of certain players by then, but their issues run a lot deeper.
Right then. Presentation time.
Yuzvendra Chahal is Man of the Match for his six wickets. "This is my first game in Australia, the wicket was turning a bit and I was enjoying my bowling. I was able to plan and bowl slow and vary my pace. Before he World Cup, we have a big series coming up in New Zealand and I'm looking forward to that."
Yum-es-Dhoni is Player of the Series. "It was a slow wicket, so it was difficult to hit whenever you wanted to. It was important to take it deep. No point going after the bowlers hwo are doing well, so that was the gameplan, of course supported brilliantly by Kedar, who plays unorthodox shots. Whether I play at 4 or 6, we need to see if the team balance can be retained. Important thing is for me to bat where the team needs, I'm happy to bat lower down at 6."
"We took it down to the wire, but when you give great players a couple of chances, it's always tough," says losing captain Aaron Finch. "The way the boys gave everything.. yes, we did put down chances, but they gave it their all. Their batting in the first couple of games was very good."
"It wasn't an easy wicket to bat on, so it was important to take the game deep," says Virat Kohli. "Two set batsmen there who knew what to do and they got the job done. Kuldeep had played a few games, so you don't want to make things too predictable. So we brought on Yuzvendra Chahal, and he played beautifully. We've been here a long time, it's been an amazing tour. We drew the T20 series, won the Test series and now the ODIs. If you had given me these results before the tour, I would have gladly taken it."
Alright then. That finally brings us to the end of this long, and engrossing tour of Australia. Easily India's best, and most successful tour ever, across formats. India have sent out some great teams in Australia in the past, produced great performances from great players, and pushed Australia. But never before have they dominated them in the manner they have on this tour. They had their stars in each of the three legs, but the team has pulled its weight together, and when that happens, you succeed more often than not.
Sterner tests await in New Zealand, where India play ODIs and T20Is. Australia will then be eager to fight back and set right this tour when they visit India for a limited-overs series. But before then, they will have to deal with Sri Lanka in a bunch of Tests.
We'll hope to see you around then. As always, your enthusiastic presence and participation makes our job of bringing the game to you live that much more fun. Hope you enjoyed our coverage - we certainly enjoyed bringing the action to you live. Thanks for all your time, comments and company. We'll see you around...
