Data
Well, that really was some excellent bowling from England, especially in those last few overs when they just didn't give the batsmen anything much to hit. The early wickets set the tone and Australia could never quite get themselves back into rhythm. George Bailey made a half-century but fell trying to lift the rate. There wasn't a single six in the innings, which tells you something. The question is whether the drop-in pitch will prove to be as difficult for England's batsmen as it seemed at time for Australia. Join us in half an hour to see whether England can chase down 218 and finish this series with a second victory.
49.6;1;Jordan to McKay, 1 run McKay winds up for a slog but this is collected at mid-on and they just pick up a single;
49.5;1;Jordan to Doherty, 1 run no hat-trick for Jordan as Doherty gets one just outside off and crunches it through point for a single;
49.4;W;Jordan to Coulter-Nile, OUT and Jordan finds himself on a hat-trick after getting this one fast and straight enough to have Coulter-Nile lbw trying to walk across and force it through leg. That looked pretty plumb at first glance.;Nathan Coulter-Nile lbw b Jordan 15 (32m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 83.33;
49.3;W;Jordan to Faulkner, OUT Jordan gets this one too full but it's brought him a wicket! Faulkner's eyes light up with a full toss at knee height, he's got it high out towards midwicket but hasn't got enough on it to clear the fielder, who takes a comfortable catch.;James Faulkner c Morgan b Jordan 27 (40m 27b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100;
49.2;?;Jordan to Faulkner, no run Jordan mixes it up now with the bouncer that Faulkner perhaps wasn't expecting - the attempted hook misses;
49.1;1;Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run low full toss again and it's driven back over the head of the bowler;
48.6;1;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run driven back past the bowler for a single;
48.5;1;Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run run-out chance here as Bresnan goes full and Faulkner's little inside edge is collected by Buttler, whose underarm throw hits the stumps. Coulter-Nile has slid the bat in nicely though and made good ground. The umpire asks for a replay but Coulter-Nile is shown to be safe;
48.4;2;Bresnan to Faulkner, 2 runs well wide of off and it's a low full toss, Faulkner can only managed to pick up two over extra cover;
48.3;1;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run uppishly driven through cover point now and Bell in the deep collects;
48.2;1;Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run wide of off now and crunched away towards point;
48.1;1;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run half a chance here for Bresnan, a dropped chance but an incredibly tough one as Coulter-Nile drives it hard back towards the bowler's left - he thrusts the hand out and it doesn't stick;
45.6;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run defended away to the off side;
45.5;1lb;Stokes to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye half a shout for lbw from Stokes as Coulter-Nile tries to work this through leg - there were two noises but it was front pad onto back pad - maybe sliding down leg but not a bad shout;
45.4;1;Stokes to Faulkner, 1 run Stokes goes for the yorker and Faulkner turns it into a low full toss that he steers wide of mid-on;
45.3;1;Stokes to Coulter-Nile, 1 run jams down on a clunky cover drive that finds the sweeper in the deep;

44.4;1;Broad to Faulkner, 1 run angled in to the pads and Faulkner just picks up a single through square leg;
44.3;?;Broad to Faulkner, no run bouncer this time and Faulkner ducks underneath it;
44.2;1;Broad to Coulter-Nile, 1 run Coulter-Nile goes aerial now, he's flicked this uppishly off his pads and Stokes is at deep midwicket, he runs in and this ball only just falls short of the diving Stokes. Nearly a catch - very nearly a catch.;
44.1;?;Broad to Coulter-Nile, no run good line outside off and it's driven hard to cover;
47.6;2;Jordan to Faulkner, 2 runs another couple of runs for Faulkner as he crunches a low full toss back past Jordan;
47.5;2;Jordan to Faulkner, 2 runs this time the yorker is just not quite the right length, a half-volley that Faulkner lifts over wide midwicket but the man running around on the boundary cuts it off;
47.4;1;Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run again a good yorker from Jordan, all Coulter-Nile can do is clip it away through square leg;
47.3;1;Jordan to Faulkner, 1 run good yorker length ball that Faulkner clips away through midwicket and they want two but the fielding is sharp enough to prevent it;
47.2;1lb;Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye Coulter-Nile tries to hoick this over leg but another one just dribbles off the leg for a leg bye;
47.1;1;Jordan to Faulkner, 1 run Faulkner backs away and Jordan follows him, this ball is clipped away through square leg to bring up the 200 for Australia;
46.6;1;Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run Faulkner drives hard to mid-off and takes a single to keep the strike;
46.5;1;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run more width and this time he crunches it through point;
46.4;4;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, FOUR runs Coulter-Nile has decided he too will go after Bresnan, and he's planted the foot and launched a drive over wide mid-off, well struck and this bounces away to the boundary;
46.3;1;Bresnan to Faulkner, 1 run fuller and wide of off, Faulkner can only nudge a single;
46.2;4;Bresnan to Faulkner, FOUR runs Faulkner gets on away to the boundary now, he's really opened up and gone for a slog through cow corner - it has only just managed to beat the man at wide midwicket in the circle;
46.1;1;Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run angled down onto the pads and Coulter-Nile tries to go aerial again but just tickles it off the pad to fine leg;

42.6;?;Broad to Coulter-Nile, no run pushed away to mid-off;
42.5;W;Broad to Wade, OUT oh, Wade has been bowled behind his legs! Wade has been walking across his stumps quite often in this innings, this time he doesn't get bat on Ball and Broad pitches it just outside leg and it goes on with the angle to take the leg stump;Matthew Wade b Broad 31 (58m 46b 2x4 0x6) SR: 67.39;
42.4;?;Broad to Wade, no run tries to cut hard now but this ball was perhaps just a touch too straight to cut, it beats the bat through to Buttler;
42.3;?;Broad to Wade, no run Wade defensively pushes away to off;
42.2;1;Broad to Faulkner, 1 run pushed out through point for another single;
42.1;4;Broad to Faulkner, FOUR runs horrible ball to start from Broad, just a rank delivery way down leg and Faulker manages to get bat on ball, which was all he had to do to tickle this away for a boundary to fine leg;
41.6;1;Jordan to Faulkner, 1 run Faulkner leans out to defend and gets off the mark with a thick inside edge away behind square;

40.6;?;Stokes to Faulkner, no run Faulkner defends his first ball back towards the bowler;
40.5;W;Stokes to Bailey, OUT Bailey tries to lift the scoring rate here and he's perished doing it, he's planted the front foot and tried to crunch Stokes straight down the ground but drags it towards mid-on instead, and Stuart Broad takes a good catch.;George Bailey c Broad b Stokes 56 (105m 74b 4x4 0x6) SR: 75.67;
40.4;1;Stokes to Wade, 1 run Wade walks down the pitch and works one out to deep midwicket along the ground;

40.2;1;Stokes to Wade, 1 run now Wade mistimes a little but gets a single to cover;
40.1;4;Stokes to Wade, FOUR runs Stokes gives Wade something short and wide to start with and Wade pounces on it - he has thrown everything at a cut and to the short square boundaries at this ground that was always going to be four;
39.6;?;Jordan to Bailey, no run Bailey gets a little width but his drive can't beat cover;
39.5;?;Jordan to Bailey, no run down leg and clips the pad on the way through;
39.4;1lb;Jordan to Wade, 1 leg bye lbw shout here from Jordan and this didn't look too bad, maybe just pitching a touch outside leg? The umpire wasn't really interested. He was struck in line but possibly height an issue too. Pretty close shout, but England don't have a review left;
39.3;?;Jordan to Wade, no run Wade nudges out towards cover point and can't find a run;
39.2;1;Jordan to Bailey, 1 run push and run now as Bailey takes off for a quick single to mid-on;

38.2;1;Broad to Bailey, 1 run Broad angles this in to the pads and with a man at deep midwicket Bailey's flick is just for a single;
38.2;1w;Broad to Bailey, 1 wide down leg side now and the Australians pick up a bonus run;
38.1;?;Broad to Bailey, no run full face of the bat from Bailey as he pushes to off;
37.6;4;Bresnan to Wade, FOUR runs this time Wade gets his pull away, and he's placed it well enough that it bounces over the boundary for four. There was a man at deep midwicket but this went squarer and Wade will be relieved to have his first boundary on the board;
37.5;1;Bresnan to Bailey, 1 run Bailey waits on a late cut and picks up one to third man;
37.4;1;Bresnan to Wade, 1 run tries to create something again by walking across his stumps but Bresnan follows him, and Wade can only open the face and run this down to third man;
37.3;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run nudged away to the off side;
37.2;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run Wade goes the big pull here as he gets something a touch short but he can't get bat on ball - much like in Perth, he's looking pretty scratchy;
37.1;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run on the back foot now, Wade crunches it back towards Bresnan;
36.6;1lb;Broad to Wade, 1 leg bye on the pads but Wade doesn't get bat on ball, settles for a leg bye instead;

35.4;1;Bresnan to Bailey, 1 run Bailey brings up his half-century with a late cut down to third man;
35.3;1;Bresnan to Wade, 1 run walks across the stumps and tries to create something but all he manages is a little inside edge onto the body for a quick single to off;

34.1;1;Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run uses the feet and drives down to long-on;
33.6;3;Bresnan to Bailey, 3 runs touch short and the bit of width allows Bailey to cut the ball and time it well enough to make deep third man's job quite difficult. But he slides and pulls the ball back to keep it to three;
33.5;1;Bresnan to Wade, 1 run goes for the hook, but has not got hold of it at all. Good short ball from Bresnan, possibly catching Wade off guard. But it lands safely despite deep square leg running in;
33.4;2;Bresnan to Wade, 2 runs takes advantage of Bresnan straying in line. Picks the ball off his hips and flicks it fine to long leg.;
33.3;1;Bresnan to Bailey, 1 run more work for midwicket as Bailey works the length ball;
33.2;1;Bresnan to Wade, 1 run walks at him and moves outside off stump and dabs it into the midwicket region;
33.1;?;Bresnan to Wade, no run length on and around off stump as he blocks from the crease with an open face;

32.5;1;Tredwell to Wade, 1 run steers this full ball through the covers for a single;
32.4;?;Tredwell to Wade, no run another little dance down the wicket but he can hit the flighted ball on middle only as far as the bowler;
32.3;?;Tredwell to Wade, no run tossed up and it goes on with the arm with very little spin. Wade ventures down the track and gets an inside edge onto pad;
32.2;1;Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run chips down the track and places the tossed up ball on leg stump square of fine leg to pick up a single.;
32.1;1;Tredwell to Wade, 1 run moves deep in his crease and punches the length ball into the covers;
31.6;4;Stokes to Bailey, FOUR runs dangerous, but effective. Full toss outside off and Bailey might have ended up looking rather silly had mid-on managed to get his hands to that. But the chip had enough power on it to beat his dive and run away for four;
31.5;2;Stokes to Bailey, 2 runs Bailey hustles and he gets through for a couple after flicking this length ball off the pads to fine leg;
31.4;1;Stokes to Wade, 1 run fullish on middle, and he plonks the front foot towards the off side and nudges it towards the midwicket region and picks up a single;
31.3;?;Stokes to Wade, no run strides forward and drives through the line of the full length ball outside off, but cannot get it past mid-off;
31.2;1;Stokes to Bailey, 1 run easily clipped off the pads as this was on a length and targeting leg stump. Deep square leg keeps it to one;
31.1;?;Stokes to Bailey, no run fullish and on off stump as he pushes to mid-off. Nice stride forward from Bailey;
30.6;1;Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run silly misfield means the over ends with a single to long-on. He reached forward and dabbed it straight of midwicket, and the fielder dived over the ball;
30.5;1;Tredwell to Wade, 1 run tossed up and angled into the pads as he turns it behind square leg for a single;
30.4;?;Tredwell to Wade, no run another venture down the track but the new batsman can't find his timing or placement. Tredwell is safely behind it;
30.3;?;Tredwell to Wade, no run pushed through on middle and leg as Wade can only defend off the back foot;
30.2;1;Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run charges him and reaches to the pitch, but still plays with the turn. Clipped to deep midwicket and he runs with the shot for a single;
30.1;1;Tredwell to Wade, 1 run bit shortish and outside off as he goes back and punches through to deep cover;
29.6;?;Stokes to Bailey, no run ventures fuller and just outside off as he drives off the back foot. Mid-on is in play again and keeps it to none;
29.5;?;Stokes to Bailey, no run fullish and on the stumps as he is able to keep it out with a push to mid-on;
29.4;1;Stokes to Wade, 1 run off the mark with a flick down to deep midwicket as this was on a length and on leg stump;
29.3;?;Stokes to Wade, no run full and just outside off as he drives towards mid-off;
29.2;W;Stokes to Maxwell, OUT Stokes does it again! Maxwell nicks off! He was doing reasonably well, especially with those drives through cover and dabs to third man, but this time he can't get good enough bat. It was fullish and he wanted to run it to third man again, but only manages a healthy edge through to the keeper.;Glenn Maxwell c ?Buttler b Stokes 22 (36m 35b 1x4 0x6) SR: 62.85;
29.1;?;Stokes to Maxwell, no run searches for the blockhole and he finds it. Maxwell can do little more than stop the ball from crashing into the stumps;
28.6;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run full and seeking off stump but Maxwell moves confidently onto his front foot and drives to deep cover;
28.5;1;Bopara to Bailey, 1 run touch fuller and he ensures the line is well outside off as Bailey guides it away to deep point;
28.4;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run fullish and just outside off as Maxwell presses forward and steers it just behind point for a single.;
28.3;1;Bopara to Bailey, 1 run fullish on middle as he pushes down to long-on off the front foot;
28.2;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run on the stumps again as this is punched to long-on for a single;
28.1;4;Bopara to Maxwell, FOUR runs the run-rate's definitely on an upswing now. strays on the pads with a full length ball and Maxwell flicks it to the leg of short fine leg and has timed it quite well;
27.6;2;Stokes to Bailey, 2 runs compensates as he tightens his line and in the process strays into the pads as he tucks it to long leg for a couple;
27.5;4;Stokes to Bailey, FOUR runs punished and how! That brings up the hundred for Australia as Bailey pounces onto the width on offer. Rocks back and cuts it behind point with considerable authority;
27.4;1;Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run third man has more work as Maxwell guides the back of a length ball away from off stump;
27.3;?;Stokes to Maxwell, no run head right over this one kept on a good length on off stump as he defends off the front foot;
27.2;1;Stokes to Bailey, 1 run opens the face to run the fullish ball outside off down to third man;
27.1;?;Stokes to Bailey, no run length on off stump as he keeps to his crease and defends;
26.6;1;Bopara to Bailey, 1 run nudged away to deep midwicket off the front foot as this was full and sneaking down leg;
26.5;?;Bopara to Bailey, no run full and just outside off as he drives, but can't time it well enough;
26.4;?;Bopara to Bailey, no run turns the full length ball on the pads to square leg;
26.3;?;Bopara to Bailey, no run shortish, but it didn't rise high enough which foiled that pull stroke. The ball lobs off the thigh and down to the keeper;
26.2;?;Bopara to Bailey, no run length ball on the stumps, Bailey is content to keep it out.;
26.1;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run worked away towards the square leg region as he rides the angle of this full length ball coming in at him;
25.6;?;Stokes to Bailey, no run fullish on off stump as he comes forward to block;
25.5;1lb;Stokes to Maxwell, 1 leg bye stifled appeal as this is full and pushed into the pads of Maxwell. Was always going down leg;
25.4;2;Stokes to Maxwell, 2 runs full and just wide enough outside off for him to lean forward and play a solid cover drive;
25.3;?;Stokes to Maxwell, no run tries a late cut, but there wasn't enough width there. Good delivery from Stokes, just short of a good length and around fifth stump;
25.2;?;Stokes to Maxwell, no run draws him forward and Maxwell meets the full length ball outside off with a straight bat. Can't get it far enough away from the bowler though;
25.1;?;Stokes to Maxwell, no run looks to dab the back of a length ball behind point, but can't place it well enough;
24.6;?;Bopara to Bailey, no run ducks in a touch off the pitch, which makes Bailey pull out a short-armed jab to midwicket;
24.5;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run pushed to long-on as he meets the length ball with a good straight bat;
24.4;?;Bopara to Maxwell, no run went a touch wide of the crease that time as he keeps it full and on off stump. Maxwell drives back to the bowler;
24.3;1;Bopara to Bailey, 1 run this time he can't get it as fine and backward point keeps it to a single;
24.2;4;Bopara to Bailey, FOUR runs very clever. It had enough width for Bailey to nudge forward and open the face. Got it fine enough to beat deep third man for another boundary.;
24.1;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run length outside off as he punches it off the front foot to deep point with little fuss;
23.6;1;Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run goes short this time and the line was right on middle too, but Maxwell covers it well as he goes ball and pulls it down to fine leg for a single;
23.5;1;Stokes to Bailey, 1 run width offered outside off stump, but it was nice and full again as Bailey sinks low and meets it with an open face;
23.4;1;Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run strays down the pads as he looks to whip it away, but has to settle for a leg bye to long leg;
23.3;?;Stokes to Maxwell, no run fullish on middle and off as he defends off the front foot;
23.2;1lb;Stokes to Bailey, 1 leg bye very tight single but Bailey makes it, courtesy the throw being deflected off his bat as he was grounding it. He'd missed the flick and Maxwell calls him through. Stokes gets to the ball quickly but can't strike the stumps direct;
23.1;1;Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run that gap just in front of square leg is proving quite useful as this short of a good length delivery is tucked away for another single;
22.6;1;Jordan to Maxwell, 1 run opens the face and chops this back of a length ball outside off just to the right of the keeper;
22.5;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run pounds in on a good length as Maxwell comes forward to defend;
22.4;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run length ball on the stumps as he looks to whip it away, but can't get bat to ball;
22.3;1;Jordan to Bailey, 1 run no movement of the feet there as Jordan generates some inward movement off a good length. Thick inside edge helps him get off strike as the ball wanders away through square leg;
22.2;?;Jordan to Bailey, no run fullish and targeting the stumps but Bailey is equal to the challenge;
22.1;1lb;Jordan to Maxwell, 1 leg bye shortish and on the hips as he works it away towards fine leg;
21.6;4;Stokes to Bailey, FOUR runs aha, we have a boundary. The first since seven overs as Bailey clips a full delivery angled in at him straight of deep midwicket;
21.5;?;Stokes to Bailey, no run full and just outside off as he drives down the ground;
21.4;1;Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run full and angling in on the pads as he clips it away through square leg;
21.3;?;Stokes to Maxwell, no run full on the stumps as he drives quite nicely. Stokes gets a finger on it and the ball deflects onto the stumps as there is a bit of an appeal, but Bailey had plonked his bat inside;
21.2;?;Stokes to Maxwell, no run very full outside off again, just inside the wide line as Maxwell looks to chop it to third man, but doesn't connect;
21.1;1;Stokes to Bailey, 1 run loses his radar this time as he offers up a full toss outside off. Bailey fails to capitalise as he goes forward and smacks it straight to point;
20.6;1;Jordan to Bailey, 1 run length ball, hitting the bat rather heavily as Bailey pulls off the bottom hand and places the ball into the midwicket region;
20.5;1;Jordan to Maxwell, 1 run fullish on off and it moves into him again, but this time Maxwell manages to squirt it away through square leg;
20.4;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run darts in off the pitch and Jordan likes it. But I suspect it might have missed leg. Hit on the knee-roll too as Maxwell is caught on the crease. Was hurrying to flick it away but he wasn't quick enough to combat the movement;
20.3;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run short cover does well there, cutting across to his right and diving to keep that elegant drive, hit on the up from Maxwell. Jordan's keeping it nice and full;
20.2;2;Jordan to Maxwell, 2 runs full and sliding down leg as Maxwell leans forward and glances it down to long leg rather nicely.;
20.1;?;Jordan to Maxwell, no run this one had very little though. 110 kph slower ball as he gets right forward and blocks;
19.6;1;Stokes to Maxwell, 1 run and he's off and running, exploiting a length ball on the pads and clipping it away to deep square leg.;
19.5;?;Stokes to Maxwell, no run solidly behind the first one, which was just short of a good length on middle and off;
19.4;W;Stokes to Marsh, OUT and he's done it! Marsh has clipped it straight to short midwicket! He's been setting a foundation, but that should might not have been part of the plan. Innocuous length ball on the pads and it was there to be whipped away through the leg side. Perhaps it might have come a little slower off the pitch, perhaps his timing was just shot, but the ball had nothing on it as it went just a little to the left of Cook, who grabbed hold quite comfortably;Shaun Marsh c Cook b Stokes 36 (85m 52b 3x4 0x6) SR: 69.23;
19.3;?;Stokes to Marsh, no run length ball on off as this time Marsh chooses to play off the back foot. Opens the face and guides it to point;
19.2;?;Stokes to Marsh, no run fuller on off stump as he draws Marsh forward and limits him to a defensive push down the pitch;
19.1;?;Stokes to Marsh, no run just back of a length outside off as Marsh gets in line and blocks;
18.6;?;Tredwell to Bailey, no run rocks back and makes room outside leg to cut the ball through point;
18.5;2;Tredwell to Bailey, 2 runs again Buttler anticipates the sweep from Bailey and tries to keep it to none, but the ball is lobbed over the keeper's outstretched arms;
18.4;?;Tredwell to Bailey, no run Bailey advances now but with the length being shortened again, he can only nudge it to the leg side;
18.3;1;Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run has a little nip down the track and having reached to the pitch, turns it just wide of mid-on. A little fumble allows the batsmen to sneak a single;
18.2;1;Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run flighted on off stump as he reaches the pitch and drives into the covers;
18.1;2;Tredwell to Bailey, 2 runs oh, Buttler saw and and was rushing down leg to try and block the lap-sweep from Bailey. But he gets good enough bat to get the ball above the keeper;
17.6;1;Bresnan to Bailey, 1 run followed by the short ball, not rising enough to trouble Bailey though as he pulls it down and has timed it well enough. There is protection at deep midwicket though.;
17.5;1;Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run and there's a bit of variation. 118 kph-slower ball as Marsh tucks off of the front foot into midwicket and collects a single;
17.4;1;Bresnan to Bailey, 1 run a thickish outside edge carries the length ball on off stump to deep third man. Bailey did open the face there as he played from the crease;
17.3;?;Bresnan to Bailey, no run prods forward to meet the good length ball with a defensive bat.;
17.2;1;Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run goes back and plays with soft hands as he dabs it into the off side and before cover can come swooping in on the ball, the batsman run through for the single;
17.1;?;Bresnan to Marsh, no run really tight bowling from Bresnan, keeps it just short of a good length on and around off stump as Marsh blocks to the covers;
16.6;?;Tredwell to Bailey, no run seen him advance again as he shortened the length. Bailey has to settle for no runs as he finds midwicket with a clip;
16.5;1;Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run chips down the track and finds long-off for complete an easy single;
16.4;1;Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run moves well across his off stump and ramps it behind to fine leg for a single. Almost premeditated that to fight the line Tredwell is bowling;
16.3;?;Tredwell to Bailey, no run more circumspect this time as he defends the fullish offspinner off the front foot;
16.2;?;Tredwell to Bailey, no run again, looking to nudge it through midwicket and he ends up edging it towards the vacant silly point region;
16.1;?;Tredwell to Bailey, no run closed the face too early there, but the leading edge doesn't carry to the bowler;
15.6;1lb;Bresnan to Bailey, 1 leg bye this time the fuller ball slides down leg and I think it went off the pads as he looked to glance it down.;
15.5;?;Bresnan to Bailey, no run good length ball, just outside off as Bailey prods forward and defends;
15.4;?;Bresnan to Bailey, no run nicely behind this again as Bresnan plugs away just outside off;
15.3;?;Bresnan to Bailey, no run safely behind that length ball, but he was looking to clip it through the midwicket region for a single, but none is available;
15.2;?;Bresnan to Bailey, no run nudges forward as he meets this fullish ball on off stump with a push into the covers.;

14.5;1;Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run mid-on has gone deep so this time it's an easy single down the ground;

14.2;1;Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run uses his feet and gets off the mark to long-on;
14.1;1;Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run full from round the wicket, driven down the ground;
13.6;W;Bresnan to Clarke, OUT all over for Clarke! The pressure brings another breakthrough. Clarke tried to heave a length ball through the leg side, it was a pretty ugly shot and takes a bottom edge into off stump which ends up out of the ground;Michael Clarke b Bresnan 8 (30m 26b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.76;
13.5;?;Bresnan to Clarke, no run adjusts well to the right hander, on off stump, defended down into the pitch and it bounces back towards the keeper;
13.4;1;Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run outside off, runs it down to third man;
13.3;?;Bresnan to Marsh, no run more power in this shot, a bottom-handed whip to a full delivery but it goes straight to midwicket;
13.2;?;Bresnan to Marsh, no run tries to work a straight delivery into midwicket but doesn't get it much further than the cut strip;

12.1;1;Tredwell to Marsh, 1 run round the wicket, driven out to deep cover;
11.6;1;Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run back of a length, taken from off stump into midwicket...good rotation of the strike, but only three boundaries so far;
11.5;1;Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run too straight and tucked off his hip down to long leg;
11.4;2;Bresnan to Clarke, 2 runs neatly worked off the stumps and bisects long leg and deep square;
11.3;?;Bresnan to Clarke, no run defended with soft hands square into the off side but Morgan is quickly in from point;
11.2;1;Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run fuller delivery, driven towards mid-off and it's the lack of timing that gives him time for a comfortable single;
11.1;?;Bresnan to Marsh, no run defended to backward point;
10.6;?;Broad to Clarke, no run short ball outside off stump, Clarke doesn't have to do much more than just nod his head out of the way;
10.5;?;Broad to Clarke, no run full outside off, a slightly flat-footed drive by Clarke but safe enough;
10.4;1;Broad to Marsh, 1 run touch fuller on middle and off, Marsh closes the face and finds a gap at square leg;
10.3;2;Broad to Marsh, 2 runs a nice piece of timing through the leg side as he flicks a straight delivery in front of square...nearly reaches the short boundary;

9.5;?;Bresnan to Clarke, no run left alone outside off, shaping back into Clarke;
9.4;1;Bresnan to Marsh, 1 run tight run! Defended off the back foot to mid-off, Jordan the fielder and he's a bit slow getting to the ball and releasing it. Opts to throw over arm, he hits direct but has taken too long;
9.3;1;Bresnan to Clarke, 1 run defended into the leg side, almost dead-batted and the ball goes nowhere so the fielders inside the ring can't stop the single;
9.2;?;Bresnan to Clarke, no run angled down the leg side, clips the pad through to Buttler so it saves a wide;
9.1;?;Bresnan to Clarke, no run full at off stump, driven firmly to a straight mid-on;
8.6;1;Broad to Clarke, 1 run short of a length, angled into the pads just a fraction and worked out to square leg;

First change of bowling as Tim Bresnan comes on
 Innings Start
Shane Watson has done the job and with that wicket Australia have moved back up to No.1 on the ICC rankings with a 4-1 series win. England will wonder how they managed to lose that match. When the batting powerplay began with 15 overs left, England needed 70 runs only with seven wickets in hand. But those wickets tumbled, and losing the established Morgan and Root within three overs was especially costly. Clint McKay and James Faulkner did a really good job at the end there before Watson put the icing on the cake. There was a stroke of luck with the stumping of Bopara, but by then the pressure was already well on England.
"It was tough to watch at the end but the boys stuck at it, and it's great to have a win on Australia Day," the coach Darren Lehmann says. "The wicket was a bit slow but the boys bowled nice and straight and fielded really well."
The Man of the Match is James Faulkner for his two wickets and 27 runs. "It was an incredible game of cricket. For that to happen on Australia day was unbelievable," Faulkner says.
The Player of the Series is Aaron Finch, who made two centuries. "It was nice to start the series off really well with the bat and contribute," Finch says. "It gives you a lot of confidence and allows you to play with some freedom."
Alastair Cook: "We should have got over the line there... some poor shots were played under pressure. Australia have had a great summer against us and ... on the back end of three months of that it probably showed for us."
Michael Clarke: "A magnificent performance by the boys with the ball especially, I thought our batting was disappointing today. For me it was about finding a way to take 10 wickets and bowl England out ... to be able to find different ways to take wickets, the bowlers on both sides deserve a lot of credit."
Clarke says he has two days off now before the Test squad flies to South Africa on Wednesday. New challenges ahead for those guys. For now, Michael Clarke is being presented with the series trophy. So the Tests and ODIs combined didn't quite end in the 10-0 that looked possible, but 9-1 is still a very comprehensive effort from Australia. Some of the England players can now fly home, which will be a great relief. Others stay on for the three Twenty20s. Join us for the first of those from Hobart on Wednesday. Until then, from Brydon Coverdale, Andrew McGlashan and Alagappan Muthu, goodbye for now.
49.4;W;Watson to Tredwell, OUT edged behind and Australia have won! Oh, what a fightback from Australia, it finishes with Tredwell backing off a touch and swinging hard outside off and a thick edge has been taken by Matthew Wade.;James Tredwell c ?Wade b Watson 0 (7m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
49.3;1;Watson to Jordan, 1 run good ball on the stumps and Jordan swings hard to leg, they scamper through for one run to midwicket as Clarke throws and can't hit the stumps at the non-striker's end!;
49.2;1lb;Watson to Tredwell, 1 leg bye Tredwell tries to lift this over midwicket but can't connect, but they scramble through for a leg bye;
49.1;?;Watson to Tredwell, no run swing and a miss! Tredwell gave himself a bit of room and tried to crunch it through off but couldn't make contact;
48.6;?;McKay to Jordan, no run all Jordan can do is get bat on ball here and works it to short midwicket;
48.5;1lb;McKay to Tredwell, 1 leg bye on the pads of Tredwell, who gets a leg bye away;
48.4;W;McKay to Bopara, OUT beaten outside off! Bopara has again just tried to tickle it away and doesn't get bat on ball. In fact there's a stumping appeal. Has Bopara lifted his foot? Oh this is close. Wade hasn't whipped the bails off, the ball has just ricocheted off him down onto the top of the bails. The third umpire is called on and this is very close. A few different replays are needed here but Bopara did lift his back foot and it was in the air when the bail was dislodged! That's out!;Ravi Bopara st ?Wade b McKay 25 (68m 44b 2x4 0x6) SR: 56.81;
48.3;1;McKay to Jordan, 1 run clipped uppishly through short midwicket, just wide of the man;
48.2;1;McKay to Bopara, 1 run just outside off from McKay and Bopara does what he's been doing all through his innings, steers it off the face down to third man - and in fact it's deflected off Wade's pad, which might have saved any more runs;
48.1;1;McKay to Jordan, 1 run driven away to point and they get through for a quick single to get Bopara back on strike;
47.6;1;Faulkner to Jordan, 1 run clipped away off his pads out to deep square leg and there is a fumble out there from the fielder but the batsmen weren't prepared to run the second - which means Jordan has the strike;
47.5;?;Faulkner to Jordan, no run Jordan watchfully defends his first ball;
47.4;1;Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run punched off the back foot down to long-on for a single;
47.3;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run again Bopara can only manage to pick out midwicket - he just can't find the gaps here;
47.2;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run clipped away to midwicket and Bopara can't find the gap;
47.1;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run driven straight back to Faulkner for no run;
46.6;W;McKay to Broad, OUT but McKay strikes back! This match just keeps swinging from one way to another! Broad has backed off just a quarter of a step and sort of reached at a straight one, and McKay gets it through to clip the top of middle stump;Stuart Broad b McKay 7 (6m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 175;
46.5;2;McKay to Broad, 2 runs tickled away off a thickish inside edge for a couple through square leg;
46.4;4;McKay to Broad, FOUR runs Broad finds the boundary! Big shot this, he's driven it through cover and found the gap - really good placement and that gives England a little breathing space once again;
46.3;1;McKay to Bopara, 1 run another single steered to third man;
46.2;1;McKay to Broad, 1 run Broad almost plays on here! He tries to force a ball through off but it's very straight, this one skews away past leg stump for a single to short fine leg;
46.1;1;McKay to Bopara, 1 run Bopara again glides a single down to third man - a run a ball is enough for England, as long as they don't accumulate many dots along the way;
45.6;1;Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run Bopara opens the face to run a single down to third man and he'll keep the strike;
45.5;W;Faulkner to Bresnan, OUT this time it's gone though! A run-out keeps Australia in the contest as Bresnan gets an inside edge onto his pad and out towards cover, they take off for a run but Bresnan is slow, Maxwell's throw is a direct hit at the non-striker's end and this time Bresnan is well short!;Tim Bresnan run out (Maxwell) 13 (15m 14b 0x4 1x6) SR: 92.85;
45.4;1;Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run Bopara works this off his hips to midwicket, Clarke's throw hits at the non-striker's end but the batsman is well home. The umpire asks for a replay, but the replay shows he was so far in he was nearly past the stumps;
45.3;1;Faulkner to Bresnan, 1 run Faulkner runs in and delivers with an Azarenka-like grunt, and it's driven down through mid-on;
45.2;?;Faulkner to Bresnan, no run punched away to cover and can't find the gap;
45.1;?;Faulkner to Bresnan, no run around the wicket to Bresnan, who defends;

44.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, 1 run swinging down the leg side and Bresnan picks up just the single with a clip off his legs;
44.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, no run defended back towards the off side;
44.3;6;Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, SIX runs Bresnan gives England some breathing space! He's lifted this off middle and leg and got enough bat on that to clear the boundary at wide midwicket, much-needed six that for England!;
44.2;2;Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, 2 runs shortish ball and Bresnan swivels this pull around behind square, and they pick up a couple to Doherty, who doesn't have one of the stronger arms in this Australian team;
44.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, no run goes for a drive down towards mid-on and can't find the gap;
43.6;4;Watson to Bopara, FOUR runs there's a much-needed boundary for England as Bopara flashes hard outside off and beats point, and the sweeper from deep cover dives in desperation but can only parry this over the boundary;
43.6;1w;Watson to Bopara, 1 wide bonus run for England now as Watson sends this one down leg for a wide;
43.5;1;Watson to Bresnan, 1 run off a leading edge now as Bresnan tries to work to leg and instead picks up a single in the air to deep point;
43.4;1;Watson to Bopara, 1 run Bopara walks across his stumps and tickles this to short fine leg, he takes off for a quick single and Doherty inside the circle throws at the stumps at the striker's end, misses, but Bresnan was probably just home;
43.3;?;Watson to Bopara, no run nudged away off the pads to the leg side and can't find a gap;
43.2;1;Watson to Bresnan, 1 run clipped away through midwicket for a single to the deep;
43.1;?;Watson to Bresnan, no run Watson goes full at the stumps, the drive can't beat mid-on;
42.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run full and straight and Bopara drives to the man in the ring on the leg side;
42.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, 1 run Bresnan gets off the mark with a clip off his pads up in the air through midwicket;
42.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, no run defended back towards Coulter-Nile;
42.3;W;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, OUT Buttler is gone now! England are digging themselves into a hole here! A shortish ball from Coulter-Nile gets Buttler's eyes lighting up and he goes for the pull, it comes out of the middle of the bat but not with enough elevation and McKay at deep midwicket takes the catch;Jos Buttler c McKay b Coulter-Nile 5 (17m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
42.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run driven back past the bowler;
42.1;1;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, 1 run sharp single here! Risky one as Bopara tucks it off his hip to midwicket and Bailey is quickly on to the ball, his throw from roughly side on just misses and lucky for Buttler it does, as he was short;
41.6;?;Watson to Buttler, no run angling it in towards off stump and Buttler drives it back to the bowler;
41.5;1;Watson to Bopara, 1 run tickled away off the pads for a single forward of square leg;
41.4;?;Watson to Bopara, no run defended back towards Watson;

40.5;1;Doherty to Bopara, 1 run tossed up a touch more and Bopara drives down to long-off;
40.4;4;Doherty to Bopara, FOUR runs bad ball and that will be a massive release for Bopara as he pulls a short one all the way to the midwicket boundary;
40.3;2;Doherty to Bopara, 2 runs another push towards long-off and well run to turn this into two as Watson is a bit slow getting to the ball;
40.2;1;Doherty to Buttler, 1 run driven down towards long-off;
40.1;?;Doherty to Buttler, no run pushed away to the off side;
39.6;2;Faulkner to Bopara, 2 runs Bopara takes a risk now and it's a biggun as he lifts Faulkner high, high out towards long-on, Watson running back from in the circle looks like he's going to make it, he has to sprint a long way back from mid-on, then at the last minute it falls just in front of him and he can only get his fingertips to it. That's a drop, albeit a very tough one to judge.;
39.5;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run again driven to Steve Smith at short cover on the bounce;
39.4;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run pushed away to the leg side;
39.3;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run driven on the bounce to short cover, the gaps are starting to feel non-existent to this pair it seems;

39.1;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run Buttler gets off the mark with a steer behind point;

38.5;?;Doherty to Bopara, no run again quickish at 95kph and Bopara defends;
38.4;?;Doherty to Bopara, no run flatter and quicker at 98kph and Bopara crunches to cover and can't find a run;

38.2;?;Doherty to Bopara, no run prodded away to short midwicket;
38.1;?;Doherty to Bopara, no run worked away to leg and can't find the gap;
37.6;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run driven away towards cover;
37.5;W;Faulkner to Root, OUT oh boy, now Root is gone! Does this match have a twist in the ending? Root has walked across his stumps and tried to paddle down to fine leg but he didn't get much on it and Doherty at short fine leg in the circle had no trouble taking that;Joe Root c Doherty b Faulkner 55 (114m 86b 3x4 1x6) SR: 63.95;
37.4;?;Faulkner to Root, no run Faulkner is over the wicket to Root, who defends back to the bowler;

37.2;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run Bopara tries another guide to third man but gets it too square;
37.1;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run Faulkner is around the wicket and angles this in towards the off stump, which it doesn't miss by much as Bopara shoulders arms;
36.6;1;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, 1 run Bopara gets off the mark now by opening the face and steering this down to third man;
36.5;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run driven down towards mid-on and he can't find the gap;

35.6;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run Bopara defends watchfully again;
35.5;?;Faulkner to Bopara, no run solid in defence;
35.4;W;Faulkner to Morgan, OUT there's the wicket Australia needed! And it's Morgan, he's driven this uppishly - but not uppishly enough - to mid-off. He looked like he was trying to clear the field but it's just sailed into the hands of Watson for an easy catch;Eoin Morgan c Watson b Faulkner 39 (50m 40b 3x4 1x6) SR: 97.5;
35.3;1b;Faulkner to Root, 1 bye nearly got through and bowled Root here, this one stays a bit low and it was also too close to off to cut, which was what Root tried to do. Nearly clips his off stump but in the end they get a bye after a ricochet off the keeper;
35.2;1;Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run driven down towards mid-off;
35.1;4;Faulkner to Morgan, FOUR runs another boundary now as Faulkner goes a touch too short and wide and Morgan cuts this away behind point;
34.6;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run nudges the length ball outside off between point and cover and they pick up a good single;
34.5;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run rock-solid forward defensive from Morgan as this was full and on off stump;
34.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run another one a little too straight, but Morgan can't beat midwicket this time either;
34.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run length ball, but this one is on the pads as he turns it to midwicket;
34.2;2;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 2 runs enjoys a thickish outside edge, but he was looking to find deep third man anyway. Back of a length just outside off fetches a couple as Root and Morgan hustle between the wickets;
34.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run driven to mid-off as he gets right forward to the full length ball outside off;
33.6;?;Faulkner to Root, no run gets a thick inside edge onto the boot as Faulkner keeps it full and on the stumps;
33.5;?;Faulkner to Root, no run full and just outside off as he charges down the track and drills it to mid-off;
33.4;2;Faulkner to Root, 2 runs deep midwicket has a job to do and Coulter-Nile does well. Another short ball but this one is punished as Root goes back and pulls quite strongly and in front of square leg;
33.3;1;Faulkner to Morgan, 1 run turns the shortish ball angled in at him down to long leg for an easy single;
33.2;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run tries that dab square on on the off side but point was rushing in. Faulker kept this one back of a length outside off too;
33.1;?;Faulkner to Morgan, no run good length ball just outside off stump keeps Morgan honest;
32.6;6;Maxwell to Root, SIX runs that's more like it, Rooty! Tossed up on middle and he carts it over midwicket and how. Quite a way to go to your fifty;
32.5;?;Maxwell to Root, no run rocks back and punches the shortish ball outside off stump to cover again;
32.4;2;Maxwell to Root, 2 runs full toss and the bat swivels in his hand as he looked to loft this over mid-on. Went off the bottom of the bat and just managed to get it over the head of Doherty who was running back;
32.3;2;Maxwell to Root, 2 runs flighted on leg stump as Root comes down on the ball with another solid sweep shot;
32.2;?;Maxwell to Root, no run lovely strike, but he can't place it properly. Finds cover as he belts this shortish ball outside off from Maxwell, who bowls around the wicket;
32.1;1;Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run tossed up and he draws Morgan to play well away from his body, but he controls his dab towards short third man. Sneak a single and Root's dive saves him;
31.6;4;Watson to Root, FOUR runs short ball, walloped! That should bring considerable relief to Root as he rocked back and launched this over midwicket. One bounce and into the boundary;
31.5;1;Watson to Morgan, 1 run plays this so late and employs really soft hands to dab the ball to third man for a single;
31.4;?;Watson to Morgan, no run fullish on off stump as Morgan leans forward and finds mid-off;
31.3;?;Watson to Morgan, no run strides forward this time to drive to mid-off as Watson bowls one full and outside off;
31.2;?;Watson to Morgan, no run Wade's been struck on the knee as this shortish ball outside off keeps quite low. Morgan was looking to cut it down to third man and though he got quite deep in the crease, he can't connect;
31.1;4;Watson to Morgan, FOUR runs whacks it over the head of the bowler again. No danger in that shot because mid-on is in and Morgan takes full advantage of the length ball on off stump;
30.6;?;McKay to Root, no run length ball on off, punched into the covers;
30.5;?;McKay to Root, no run length ball angled in at the stumps as he defends;
30.4;1;McKay to Morgan, 1 run strays on the pads and Morgan turns it away behind square leg;
30.3;1lb;McKay to Root, 1 leg bye premeditated scoop shot and the full length ball comes off the bicep. Rushes through for a single as the ball on off runs down to third man;
30.2;?;McKay to Root, no run fullish and outside off but Root can only push it back to the bowler and walks off briskly towards square leg;
30.1;1;McKay to Morgan, 1 run allows this shortish ball on leg stump to come to him before glancing it down to long leg;
29.6;?;Watson to Root, no run length ball on and around off stump, solidly pushed into the off side as short cover runs to his right and keeps it to a dot;
29.5;1;Watson to Morgan, 1 run drops it down towards the point region and scurries through for a quick single. Didn't get it off the middle, but it will suffice;
29.4;6;Watson to Morgan, SIX runs slapped straight over the top, that's the first six of the game! Watson overpitches this time and the left-hander was waiting for it. Strides forward and unleashes a full swing of the bat;
29.3;1;Watson to Root, 1 run better, works this wide of mid-on after coming down the pitch to meet the fullish ball on middle;
29.2;?;Watson to Root, no run just short of a good length as he pushes down to mid-off;
29.1;?;Watson to Root, no run fullish on off stump draws Root forward and defend as England's required rate inches over five;
28.6;?;McKay to Morgan, no run full on off stump as Morgan stride forward and drives back to the bowler;
28.5;1;McKay to Root, 1 run length and straying onto the pads, perfect recipe for the flick through midwicket. Nelson's up;
28.4;?;McKay to Root, no run just back of a good length as Root responds with a back foot defensive;
28.3;?;McKay to Root, no run full on middle as Root drives solidly to mid-on. He needs to get those in the gap somehow;
28.2;1;McKay to Morgan, 1 run bit short and it had just enough room for Morgan go back and cut past point;
28.1;?;McKay to Morgan, no run shortish outside off as Morgan is content with pushing down the ground;
27.6;1;Watson to Morgan, 1 run works the short ball off the hips to midwicket;
27.5;?;Watson to Morgan, no run fullish and on a fifth-stump line as he moves forward and drives to mid-off;
27.4;?;Watson to Morgan, no run punch off the back foot to mid-off as this was shortish and outside off;
27.3;?;Watson to Morgan, no run uses soft hands as he dabs it into the off side and rushes down for the single, but Root sends him back. Good, accurate bowling from Watson as this was back of a length outside off;
27.2;1;Watson to Root, 1 run shortish and Root is propped up nicely on the back foot as he pulls down and in front of square for a couple. Nicely placed as he bisects the two men in the deep there;
27.1;?;Watson to Root, no run back of a length just outside off as Root stands up tall and blocks;
26.6;1;Doherty to Root, 1 run drags this one short and Root is quick on the back foot as he punches through the covers;
26.5;?;Doherty to Root, no run driven to mid-off as Doherty attacks off stump with a bit of flight;

26.3;1;Doherty to Morgan, 1 run tossed up on middle and leg as he turns it away through midwicket;

26.1;?;Doherty to Morgan, no run full delivery on off stump as he continues over the wicket to the left-hander. Solid forward defence from Morgan;
25.6;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run "wait" was the first ball, but then Morgan sees the single on offer. Back of a length on the pads as he shuffles across and tucks it just square of midwicket;
25.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Root, 1 run on the front foot and flicks the full length ball on middle to deep square leg for another single;
25.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Root, no run steady line and length on off stump as Root goes back to defend;
25.3;3;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 3 runs chipped just over the top of midwicket. And though two men were running after it, the ball was pulled inside just before striking the boundary rope. Nice shot from Morgan as Coulter-Nile strayed too straight;
25.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, no run fullish on off stump as he comes forward and drives down the pitch;
25.1;1;Coulter-Nile to Root, 1 run full and on middle and leg as he clips the ball through to deep square leg;
24.6;1;Doherty to Root, 1 run length on off stump as he goes back and punches into the covers. Bailey gets a good bounce and sends in the throw. A direct hit would have had Root there, despite the full-length dive. Doherty might have thought it would break the stumps on it's own. May even have been out had he collected it;
24.5;?;Doherty to Root, no run goes back and punches the length ball down to mid-on;
24.4;1;Doherty to Morgan, 1 run stays back and turns the ball with soft hands just in front of square leg and they scurry through for a quick single;
24.3;?;Doherty to Morgan, no run strides down the pitch but Doherty tries to push it wide outside off. Morgan's reach is far enough as he drills the ball to mid-on;

24.1;?;Doherty to Morgan, no run tossed up on middle as he clips it to midwicket off the front foot;
23.6;1;Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run fullish and pushed across him as he moves forward and dabs to third man to get off the mark straight away;
23.5;W;Coulter-Nile to Cook, OUT he's spooned it to short cover! Coulter-Nile is elated as he sends the England captain packing. It was a good length ball, but Cook was early into his drive through the covers. He tried removing the bottom hand off the bat, but that didn't help as the ball strikes the blade a little too high and Bailey dives forward to complete a good grab;Alastair Cook c Bailey b Coulter-Nile 39 (90m 62b 3x4 0x6) SR: 62.9;
23.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run length ball angled across him as he steers it off the back foot to backward point;

22.5;?;Doherty to Cook, no run fires it in on leg stump and it hits Cook on the back boot as he looks to flick it away through square leg;
22.4;1;Doherty to Root, 1 run skips down the track and presents a straight bat despite Doherty shortening his length. Single taken as the ball is hit just wide of mid-off;
22.3;?;Doherty to Root, no run tossed up on middle as he leans forward to defend;
22.2;?;Doherty to Root, no run vociferous appeal from Doherty as he traps Root on the back foot with a dart on leg stump, might have been sliding down;
22.1;1;Doherty to Cook, 1 run fullish, but Cook prefers to go back and cuts this one from off stump to deep point;
21.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Root, no run shortish and with just enough width to lure Root into a cut, but he finds point;
21.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Cook, 1 run punched away past cover. Good balance from Cook as he picks up a single off this back of a length ball just outside off;
21.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run full and angled across Cook as he comes forward and drives to mid-off;
21.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run sways towards leg to whack this short ball with a bit of room outside off, but I think we went at it a bit too hard. Gets a thick bottom edge;
21.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run a bit too close for that short to work as Cook guides this short of a length ball on off stump straight to point;
21.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run lovely line just outside off and Cook allows it passage to the keeper;

20.5;?;Doherty to Root, no run keeps it on and around off stump as he pushes into the covers;
20.4;?;Doherty to Root, no run went back to sneak a single to short third man, but there was none on offer;
20.3;1;Doherty to Cook, 1 run premeditated the sweep this time and even if Doherty shortened his length, the line is sufficient to help him beat backward squar leg;
20.2;1;Doherty to Root, 1 run room offered outside off stump as Root glides forward and drives through the covers;
20.1;?;Doherty to Root, no run dances down the track and works it away to midwicket, but can't beat the man;
19.6;1;Maxwell to Root, 1 run flighted on middle and leg as he nudges it through the midwicket region for a single;
19.5;?;Maxwell to Root, no run this time it comes a little slower off the pitch to ruin Root's timing. Only gets a thick edge and Root is not pleased. That was a shortish delivery too;
19.4;2;Maxwell to Root, 2 runs flatter delivery on off stump as he rocks back and cuts well in front of point;
19.3;?;Maxwell to Root, no run the old faithful sweep is in display again, that's the fifth time in two overs, right? Finds short fine leg again;
19.2;?;Maxwell to Root, no run loads of flight from Maxwell, so much that Root is able to take it on the full and lap sweep it to short fine leg;
19.1;2;Maxwell to Root, 2 runs shortish ball pushed across him as Root goes deep in his crease and cuts through the covers;
18.6;1;Doherty to Root, 1 run rocks back as this is a touch short and cuts to deep point for a single and that brings up the fifty partnership between these two;

18.4;1;Doherty to Cook, 1 run goes back and whips the ball in front of midwicket for a single;
18.3;4;Doherty to Cook, FOUR runs muscled away, not often you describe a stroke from Cook that way, but he got down on one knee and swept this flat ball on middle with a bit of disdain;
18.2;?;Doherty to Cook, no run nicely flighted on off stump as Cook reaches forward and defends;
18.1;1;Doherty to Root, 1 run chips down the track and pushes the flighted ball on off stump down the ground and runs with the shot. Hustles through to complete the quick single;
17.6;1;Maxwell to Root, 1 run tossed up on leg invites another good sweep shot from Root to end the over as deep midwicket runs to his right to clean up;
17.5;1;Maxwell to Cook, 1 run stays around to the left-hander as Cook tucks the tossed up delivery on leg towards square leg for a single;
17.4;1;Maxwell to Root, 1 run a bit of orthodoxy now after the boundary has been taken, driven down the ground;
17.3;4;Maxwell to Root, FOUR runs this time it's the reverse and he's got good wood on it. Fetched the ball from around middle and leg and beat deep point comfortably;
17.2;2;Maxwell to Root, 2 runs flighted on the pads as Root goes down and sweeps to deep square leg;
17.1;?;Maxwell to Root, no run starts off around the wicket and its quite short too. Root finds short fine leg with his pull though;

15.6;1;Watson to Cook, 1 run short of a length, flicked off the back foot through square leg...smart batting from Cook;
15.5;?;Watson to Cook, no run pushed firmly up to mid-off;
15.4;1;Watson to Root, 1 run full on middle, worked just to the right of mid-on who is deep enough to allow a single;

8.4;?;McKay to Root, no run full on off stump, behind the line and defended;
8.3;W;McKay to Stokes, OUT picks out midwicket! Australia getting an early foothold. A short ball, holds in the surface and Stokes is early into his pull then can't keep the ball down. Like Bell, a poor stroke on this surface.;Ben Stokes c Marsh b McKay 0 (10m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

6.1;?;McKay to Cook, no run left alone outside off;
5.6;W;Coulter-Nile to Bell, OUT from beauty to the beast! The danger of driving on this pitch, it wasn't a half volley and Bell tried to go on the up and only succeeded in spooning a catch to mid-off. Careless really from Bell, having already been given warning signs with a couple of leading edges.;Ian Bell c Finch b Coulter-Nile 14 (23m 23b 3x4 0x6) SR: 60.86;
5.5;4;Coulter-Nile to Bell, FOUR runs ah, that's lovely from Bell...a beautiful back-foot square drive which pierces the gap between point and cover. Technically perfect;
5.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run punched to midwicket;
5.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run almost early with an on-drive again, which brings the danger of spooning a catch and this was in the air a little while towards mid-off;

5.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Cook, no run touch short, driven off the back foot to cover;
4.6;?;McKay to Bell, no run full on middle and off, defended and the ball runs to square leg;

4.4;?;McKay to Bell, no run defended to cover;
4.3;?;McKay to Bell, no run back of a length outside off, nicely timed square off the back foot but straight to point;

3.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run left alone outside off, this one carries nicely to Wade;

3.1;1;Coulter-Nile to Cook, 1 run short outside off, stays on the back foot and cuts behind point;

2.5;?;McKay to Bell, no run fuller and closer to off stump, defended to cover;

1.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run a little fuller, left alone again;

1.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Bell, no run play and a miss as he shapes to cut a wide delivery, beaten by lack of bounce;

Welcome back. The first half of this match went well for England, barring some dodgy fielding, a few hours of solid batting should see them win but it's a tricky, slow surface. Australia were subdued throughout against some very good bowling. Xavier Doherty and Shane Watson will have key roles to play with the ball.
