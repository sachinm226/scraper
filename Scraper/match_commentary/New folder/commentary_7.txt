Data
6.07 pm From 45 for 6, and on a pitch that was turning viciously, I don't think anyone could have foreseen such a resilient recovery. Hosein ends with 3 for 30, but that somehow feels incredibly unsatisfying and underwhelming considering the fact that he had figures of 3 for 5 after two overs at 45 for 6 on a pitch giving him all the assistance he could dream of. What a fightback by the Australia lower-order, including a pair of half-century stands. First a 51-run seventh wicket stand between Starc and Wade, but then the real gut punch came from Zampa and Wes Agar adding 59 for the ninth wicket at better than a run a ball.
West Indies were in front for the majority of the innings but heading into the break it is Australia who look like favorites to come out of this match with 10 valuable points on the World Cup Super League points table because the West Indies are facing a tricky target on a crumbling wicket. Stay with us for the start of the chase in a bit.
Shivam: "lucky that australia were able to change their lineup despite the toss having taken place - hazlewood would have been much less valuable with the bat and it's a spinner's deck anyway, so definitely got lucky with the whole wes agar situation"
47.1;W;Joseph to Agar, OUT you wait all day for a bus and then two come at once! Joseph firest this in full and a yard outside leg stump following Agar backing way away from the stumps. Agar tries to flick over square leg but gets a leading edge that balloons over point. Lewis takes a catch backpedaling from the ring.;Wes Agar c Lewis b Joseph 41 (38m 36b 3x4 2x6) SR: 113.88;
46.6;W;Cottrell to Zampa, OUT yorker finally cleans up Zampa. Full on the stumps at 130 kph, Zampa backs away to heave over cover and misses, off stump is uprooted. Cottrell gives a very tame and frustrated salute, almost in disgust that they've allowed this stand to last for as long as it has. Zampa has played an incredibly valuable hand and the West Indies know it.;Adam Zampa b Cottrell 36 (84m 62b 4x4 0x6) SR: 58.06;

44.5;4;Walsh to Zampa, FOUR runs reverse sweep! And connects beautifully! Premeditated this to a full ball on middle, cracks it off the meat of thebat and sends it wide of backward point to the rope. That was a shot of a top-class batsman.;

40.5;2;Joseph to Agar, 2 runs another overpitched ball on off, driven firmly along the ground wide of Mohammed in the covers for another pair.;
40.4;4;Joseph to Agar, FOUR runs very very poor from Cottrell at mid-off. Full ball on middle, punched firmly to Cottrell, he attacks it from mid-off trying to deny what would've been a comfortable single and a matador red cape effort bending very tamely to try to pick it up turns the ball into a boundary.;
40.3;2;Joseph to Agar, 2 runs nearly a catch at extra cover! Pitched up on off stump to encourage a drive, Agar obliges with an uppish heave toward Mohammed in the covers to his left, he leaps but it's just out of reach and goes away for two.;

38.6;4;Joseph to Zampa, FOUR runs another close shave! Full in the slot at 137 kph on fourth stump, carbon copy ball that snared Wade with a loose drive.

38.5;1;Joseph to Agar, 1 run full on sixth stump, flat-footed swipe at this and a thick edge flies to third man.;
38.4;1;Joseph to Zampa, 1 run nearly another wicket! Short on the legs, tame pull flutters over Pooran leaping at short backward square leg standing 10 yards inside the ring. If he was on the ring it was a straightforward catch but instead eludes him for one.;

Pooran reaches up above his head on the circle at extra cover to intercept this with ease. Wade drops to a knee after realizing he's thrown it away after doing so much hard work to dig Australia out of trouble.;Matthew Wade c Pooran b Joseph 36 (118m 68b 2x4 0x6) SR: 52.94;

35.1;1;Mohammed to Wade, 1 run short outside off, slapped through cover for a long single.;
34.6;?;Hosein to Zampa, no run what a leave! Zampa trusts that this will spin and it does as a good length ball lands on fourth stump and straightens past off to howls from Hope and Pollard.;
34.5;?;Hosein to Zampa, no run full on off, smokes a drive into Pollard's thigh under a helmet at silly mid-off.;

13.5;?;Walsh to Wade, no run flighted on a good length on off stump, Wade goes to play a paddle sweep and there looks like a deflection. He's overstretching badly and Hope appeals for a stumping but really it looked like he gloved it. Given not out. They appeal for DRS! I think this may be overturned. They look at the stumping appeal first and Wade just has his toe behind the line. On reflection it may have passed his glove and flicked the black forearm sleeve Wade has on to produce a tiny deviation. Nothing on ultraedge when the ball passes the bat and Wade's gloves. It stays not out. West Indies lose a review.;

12.2;W;Hosein to Henriques, OUT edge to slip! Hosein once again slows it down and flights it more getting the just rewards. This one is on sixth stump on a full length, Henriques gropes at this well away from his body in awkward fashion with a cross bat swipe and the extra bounce plus sharp turn has it fly off a thick edge to Holder at rib height moving to his right at slip.;Moises Henriques c Holder b Hosein 4 (29m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.76;

10.5;W;Hosein to Carey, OUT Carey looked uncomfortable all over long to Hosein and finally comes undone! Hosein tosses this up with more flight full on fifth stump to encourage a drive against the turn to mid-off, but he's been getting sharp turn all over and Carey doesn't get to the pitch. Unsurprisingly he pays the price as the ball rips past the inside edge of the attempted drive, through the gate and crashes into middle stump.

 Innings Start
9.49 pm Solid chase by the hosts to claim 10 points in World Cup Qualifying on what was a very tricky wicket. Australia only have themselves to blame with some extremely sloppy fielding. Pooran was dropped twice, including the first time on 26 with the score 123 for 5 on a straightforward chance at mid-off into the lap of Moises Henriques. Pooran and Holder parlayed that extra life into a 93-run partnership and the pressure eased on the very next ball which Pooran smoked to the rope to rub salt into the wound. Pooran ends unbeaten.
Pooran is named Man of the Match for his eighth ODI half-century: "I want to dedicate this to my wife. This is my first half-century since I got married so this is for her. For me it was just about building a partnership and fighting with Jason. We just had to find a way and fight. I was just backing my strengths and wanted to hit the gaps as hard as possible. I work day in and day out, try a lot of things in the nets just to get better each day. I have goals I want to accomplish and I can only do that by working hard. All the bowlers bowled fantastic today up front. Well done to them. I just felt like we allowed them to get too much runs and we gave them a chance in the game. That's something as a group we won't tolerate. The body language in the field dropped. That's something we don't like."
Australia captain Alex Carey: "Obviously it doesn't help when you're 5 for not a lot. Wade and the bowlers did a great job to get us to a total and we were back in the game. We took some early wickets again and the belief was there. We created opportunities and we were in the game in the back end. Unfortunately we couldn't quite close it out and it proved we were 20 or 30 short. I think both teams tonight, spin is a threat on these type of wickets. I think the way Matt Wade and Starc combatted that, Adam Zampa had a plan against them. I suppose with the newer ball it might spin and bounce a bit more so we need to get through those first overs against the spinners. A great effort again to get to 190 and we were definitely in the game. I thought the bowlers did a fantastic job. At five down, we had an opportunity to crack it open again. We definitely created enough to stay in the game. Bring on game three. The batting group has a bit to prove to get a good score on the board for our quicks but our quicks and spinners are doing a great job."
West Indies captain Kieron Pollard: "It's pleasing to win. Obviously when you start a cricket match you want to win, but to say I'm overall pleased with our performance throughout the entire game, I think we have some work to do. Having Australia [45 for 6] and they getting 190, I thought we didn't put our foot on the X. They getting to 190, we gave them an opportunity to come into the game. Our batters didn't make it easy as well. It seems like we don't like to do things the easy way. The spinners were fantastic. Hosein coming up trumps again, Walshy hard work continues to pay off. The start that we got, getting a couple wickets early was fantastic by the bowlers. But as I said, 180-190 I think is a bit disappointing on our part to be totally honest. Australia have world-class bowlers. What was good this time around was the fight by the guys, Nicholas Pooran getting that half-century and Jason Holder as well. Pooran has been looking like his old self again. He was a bit scratchy tonight but sometimes that's what you need in a game like this. You want someone to scrap and I think they both scrapped well for us to come through for a victory. It's a Catch-22 situation with [Jason Mohammed]. Obviously Jason is playing a role where if you lose a couple wickets, you want him to bat long. From a Super50 perspective he has done well. Chase normally does that for us. When you look at the makeup of our team and me coming back not being able to bowl, he gives us that sixth bowling option. We will look at it as a team and come up with our best combination to play this third game."
West Indies move past Ireland up into a tie with Pakistan for fifth place on the Super League points table at 40 points. Pakistan have played one more match than West Indies. Australia remain in third place on 50 points, 30 points behind Bangladesh who have played 12 matches to Australia's 8 games. Come back on Monday for the series finale between these two sides. That's all for now. For Andrew McGlashan, I'm Peter Della Penna. Take care!
37.6;4;Turner to Joseph, FOUR runs almighty heave ends the match in style! Joseph slams a full ball from fourth stump high and deep over midwicket bouncing into the rope. West Indies clinch a four-wicket win with 12 overs to spare. They claim 10 very significant points on the World Cup Qualifying Super League points table. The speed of the win too is significant as they'll get a healthy net run rate bump too.;
37.6;5w;Turner to Joseph, 5 wide good length ball spins past leg stump, Joseph's legs, and Carey's gloves. Splits leg slip too and keeps spinning away to the rope for five extras. Scores level.;

36.5;1;Starc to Pooran, 1 run fullish length ball on sixth stump at 142 kph, Pooran pushes at this with hard hands and is in front of the shot, he shovels this perilously close to extra cover but it just clears him landing wide of mid-off for one. Cries of "Catch!" go in vain.;
36.4;1;Starc to Joseph, 1 run bouncer on the body at 141 kph, Joseph fights this off awkwardly producing a top edge over square leg landing in no man's land for one.;

35.4;1;Turner to Pooran, 1 run dropped at slip! short on fourth stump, rocks back to cut and is cramped for room, thick edge goes to the right hand of Wade at slip. He was poorly balanced and falling over expecting the ball to come much hotter off the bat than it did. He stumbles clumsily to the ground as the ball continues off his hands behind Carey to allow Pooran a single to bring up his fifty. He was dropped at mid-off by Henriques off a straightforward chance on 26 as well. Wade made that last chance at slip look much harder than it was. He moved too early falling left and the ball went to his right hand.;

34.3;W;Starc to Holder, OUT full and angled into the pads, Holder prods forward and it beats the bat clanging into the pads just above the knee roll. Big lbw shout upheld and Holder calls for DRS straight away. A lump forms in Joel Wilson's throat... This one is touch and go. And ball-tracking shows it skimming the bails. Umpire's call stays on field. Joel Wilson narrowly avoids an Audi, and Holder's innings has ended.;Jason Holder lbw b Starc 52 (97m 69b 5x4 1x6) SR: 75.36;
34.2;2;Starc to Holder, 2 runs fullish length ball on fourth stump, Holder spanks this on the up over mid-on for a long single, they try to come back for a tight two. A relay to the non-striker's end is a direct hit and Pooran is barely home as the ball skims off the bails on the fly.;

13.2;W;Turner to Hope, OUT and the decision pays off almost immediately! Turner's maiden ODI scalp on just his second ball in the format. What a gem!

8.3;W;Zampa to Mohammed, OUT oof! What a googly! Flights this full on middle and leg, Mohammed doesn't read it at all and plays around it, then has the misfortune of having it go off his pads and ricocheting back towards the stumps.
