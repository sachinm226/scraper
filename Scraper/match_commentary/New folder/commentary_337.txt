11.55am: England's tail finally wagged, a brief spell of happy slogging to cheer the crowd after more sterling work from Ryan Harris secured his place on the honours board. As Swann and Broad showed, these are still good conditions to have a bat... but Australia have to get everything straight between their ears. Join us in ten to see how they go.
100.1;W;Pattinson to Broad, OUT nicked to the keeper, the partnership is ended two short of fifty! Or is it? Broad doesn't walk, naturally, and has a wee conflab with Swann before deciding to review. This looks a bit hopeful, as there was a clear deviation on the way through... Though replays show it hit the flap of the pad, too. Hot Spot picks up a faint edge, though, so any more Broad controversy is quickly put to bed. England are all out for 361, less than they will have wanted but buoyed by another last-man stand of decent proportions;Stuart Broad c ?Haddin b Pattinson 33 (53m 29b 5x4 1x6) SR: 113.79;
99.6;?;Harris to Swann, no run length on the stumps, played back in more conservative fashion;
99.5;?;Harris to Swann, no run swats across the line but doesn't connect;
99.4;4;Harris to Swann, FOUR runs dug in short and again Swann climbs into it, sending the ball in a soaring arc out towards fine leg, deep square was in and won't get round in time, as it bounces to the boundary;
99.3;?;Harris to Swann, no run bumper, Swann fends at it and the manages to play it down on to the pitch;
99.2;?;Harris to Swann, no run back of a length, seaming across and Swann tries a cute, late uppercut but misses;
99.1;?;Harris to Swann, no run round the wicket, swings across the line and the ball rolls down the track;
98.6;6;Siddle to Broad, SIX runs another boundary, this time a six, though I'm not quite sure Usman Khawaja picked it up out at deep square leg! Broad pulled a short ball, the bat rolled in his hand a touch and it looped very high, Khawaja was in off the rope, suddenly he realised that he needed to backpedal and the ball eventually dropped safe a few inches over the rope - might have one the fielder could have got his hands under, though;
98.5;3;Siddle to Swann, 3 runs goes after another length ball, hitting through the line and lofting the ball high over mid-off, it plops into the outfield and doesn't quite roll all the way;
98.4;?;Siddle to Swann, no run;
98.3;1;Siddle to Broad, 1 run bumper, well-directed up towards the chest, hoicked round the corner for a single;
98.2;4;Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs shot! This was a length ball outside off, Broad stretched himself up to his full height and punched it straight back down the ground, Swann ducking underneath to avoid taking any damage;
98.1;1;Siddle to Swann, 1 run straight, on a length and tucked through square leg for one;

87.3;?;Harris to Bresnan, no run poor shot late in the day, chases a full wide delivery that he could barely reach...it swung;
87.2;?;Harris to Bresnan, no run short of a length, angled down the leg side, and this is a good diving save to his left by Haddin;

86.6;?;Smith to Anderson, no run strangled appeal for lbw but it pitched outside leg stump;
86.5;?;Smith to Anderson, no run beaten by a very full delivery which he seemed to just play over the top off...bounces awkwardly for Haddin who can't take it cleanly;
86.4;?;Smith to Anderson, no run full at off stump, defended to the covers;
86.3;1;Smith to Bresnan, 1 run finds another edge, lovely length on middle and off, it turns but goes low and wide of slip;
86.2;?;Smith to Bresnan, no run another full toss, perhaps a tactic, and this one is driven on the bounce back to Smith;
86.1;1;Smith to Anderson, 1 run short outside off, punched off the back foot to the right of mid-off;
97.6;?;Harris to Broad, no run goes round the wicket, short and flying over Broad's shoulder as he hops in the crease;
97.5;1;Harris to Swann, 1 run nudged off the body through square;
97.4;4;Harris to Swann, FOUR runs four more, another drive through square! Harris' pace might be down a touch, it is a hot morning, and Swann sees this big, gets a stride in and clubs to the rope;
97.3;4;Harris to Swann, FOUR runs drops a wee bit short and Swann continues to swing like a kid in the park, carting a pull shot from outside off towards deep midwicket, it beats square leg running round;
97.2;?;Harris to Swann, no run floated up wide of the stumps, chopped into the ground to point;
97.1;4;Harris to Swann, FOUR runs too full and wide from Harris, his first poor ball this morning and Swann creams a drive through the covers for the eighth boundary of the morning;
96.6;?;Siddle to Broad, no run drops short again, doesn't get up all that much but Broad drops his hands under this one;
96.5;4;Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs pitched up in the corridor, the ball's not doing much any more and Broad gets half a stride in before boofing a cover drive to the fence;
96.4;?;Siddle to Broad, no run slightly back of a length, bit more pace in this delivery and Broad defends;
96.3;4;Siddle to Broad, FOUR runs he's not an easy man to intimidate, Broad, and although this isn't particularly short, he sits deep and clatters four over midwicket;
96.2;?;Siddle to Broad, no run short and straight again, trying to playing the xylophone on Broad's ribs, he nudges it square;
96.1;?;Siddle to Broad, no run back of a length, down the leg side and Broad maybe gets a tickle of glove on it, the ball drops just in front of Haddin;

85.5;?;Harris to Anderson, no run touch fuller this time, outside off, Anderson nearly chases it before raised the bat out of the line;
85.4;?;Harris to Anderson, no run feeling for this outside off as it is pushed across outside off...no footwork from Anderson;

85.2;?;Harris to Bresnan, no run gets across and defends into the off side;
85.1;?;Harris to Bresnan, no run short of a length outside off, left alone;

84.5;?;Smith to Anderson, no run short outside off, defended to cover;
84.4;?;Smith to Anderson, no run defended past slip off the back foot;
84.3;W;Smith to Prior, OUT he's got three! What a spell for Australia. This one skidded through outside off, perhaps an attempted flipper, Prior went for the cut and gets a healthy top edge to Haddin;Matt Prior c ?Haddin b Smith 6 (29m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;

80.1;W;Smith to Bairstow, OUT and another! It's a full toss. Bairstow has just bunted it back to Smith. Christmas time for Smith and Australia. An awfully lazy dismissal from Bairstow, who drove a fraction early and Smith collected a low chance in his follow through;Jonny Bairstow c & b Smith 67 (199m 146b 7x4 0x6) SR: 45.89;

79.2;?;Siddle to Prior, no run defended back to the bowler;

78.1;?;Smith to Prior, no run defended off the back foot;

76.6;W;Smith to Bell, OUT he's done it! Clarke's captaincy brings another wicket. It's a perfectly-pitched leg break which grips a fraction, finds the edge and carries low to Clarke at slip. What a bonus for Australia;Ian Bell c Clarke b Smith 109 (307m 211b 16x4 0x6) SR: 51.65;
76.5;4;Smith to Bell, FOUR runs there's a full toss and Bell puts it away...used his feet then crunched it over wide mid-on. Didn't actually time it that well, but the power was enough;

74.5;4;Watson to Bell, FOUR runs on leg stump, flicked away fine and the fielder at deep square has not chance of getting around;
74.4;2;Watson to Bell, 2 runs there it is! Another Ashes hundred for Ian Bell. He opens the face and steers backward of point, placement has been a hallmark of his hundred and this is another example;
74.3;?;Watson to Bell, no run pushed down the leg side;
74.2;?;Watson to Bell, no run a yorker, dug out and it bobbles to the leg side...no chance of the single;
74.1;2;Watson to Bell, 2 runs low full toss, tailing in a touch, Bell flicks it backward of square...the fielder is more at deep square than long leg so it's an easy two to take him to 99;
73.6;?;Pattinson to Bairstow, no run another bouncer to finish the over, this one is within the parameters as Bairstow ducks;
73.6;1w;Pattinson to Bairstow, 1 wide that's a very short bouncer and it's too wide for the umpire;
73.5;4;Pattinson to Bairstow, FOUR runs very nice shot, just timing as he flicks this from outside off through straight mid-on with a little turn of the bottom hand...lovely stuff from Bairstow;

72.3;?;Watson to Bairstow, no run and he fields this delivery as Bairstow defends a length ball;
72.2;3;Watson to Bell, 3 runs another flowing drive, it was just a fraction wider which allowed Bell to open the face and steer it wide of cover...a good chase to the boundary by Smith, and a dive, saves a single;

71.6;?;Pattinson to Bairstow, no run forward on off stump, Bairstow forward and blocking back up the wicket;

56.5;?;Watson to Bell, no run full just outside off, a lovely flourish of the bat through the line, gets it to mid-off;
56.4;2;Watson to Bell, 2 runs back foot punch through the covers, an easy nudge away down the hill, gets a couple;

54.2;4;Watson to Bairstow, FOUR runs back of a length well outside off, Bairstow flashes at it without getting into a great position and got a thick top edge that flies over gully, slightly fortunate but a hard flash at a poor ball;
54.1;?;Watson to Bairstow, no run full of length just outside off stump, driven at and gets the inner half of the bat towards mid-off;
53.6;1;Harris to Bairstow, 1 run fuller length and clipped off the hip down to long leg;

51.5;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run very solid in defence on off stump;

51.2;?;Siddle to Bell, no run fullish and on off stump, no real swing and this ball is driven away to mid-off;

49.3;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run yorker again and Bairstow jams the bat down on this one!;
49.3;1nb;Siddle to Bairstow, (no ball) Siddle strikes! Or does he? No! If ever there was a dismissal that looked like replays could not overturn it was this. Siddle has bowled it full and straight and Bairstow has missed his drive and been clean bowled. But the umpire asks for a replay of the no-ball and this is tight! Oh so tight! The close-up shows that Siddle has just failed to land any part of his heel behind the line - it's a no-ball and Bairstow survives!;
49.2;?;Siddle to Bairstow, no run left alone outside off;
49.1;3;Siddle to Bell, 3 runs lovely shot! It looked really well timed off the bat but has actually pulled up inside the rope, Siddle swung it in and Bell just pushed an on-drive all the way along the ground;

 Innings Start
4.55pm: That wicket secures a five-wicket haul for Swann, his second at Lord's, and gives England the option of enforcing the follow-on ... which they predictably turn down. Alastair Cook and Joe Root will be back out to begin the mental disintegration second innings in ten. Do join us.
53.3;W;Swann to Harris, OUT Harris goes on the attack and Khawajas it to mid-on, Pietersen taking an excellent running catch from over this shoulder. The ball came off the toe of the bat, with Harris looking to hit down the ground - but it's Australia who have been left on their Harris, bowled out for 128, a deficit of 233;Ryan Harris c Pietersen b Swann 10 (31m 25b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40;

51.4;?;Swann to Harris, no run props forward with bat next to pad and defends;
51.3;?;Swann to Harris, no run chipped back and dropped, bursts through both hands as Swann reached to his left - second drop off Swann but he'll have to fume at himself this time;
51.2;4b;Swann to Harris, 4 byes full and pitching outside leg stump and this has absolutely ripped past Prior as Harris shouldered arms, the ball racing to long leg for byes;

50.6;?;Broad to Pattinson, no run goes fuller, slightly wide of the stumps, pushed into the covers;

50.2;?;Broad to Pattinson, no run good length, pushed across from over the wicket, stoutly defended into the covers;

49.6;?;Swann to Harris, no run good length, doesn't really turn much, Harris gets in line behind his bat and blocks;
49.5;4;Swann to Harris, FOUR runs drops short outside off and Harris totters back to middle a cut shot through point - here begineth the marathon last-wicket defiance, then;
49.4;?;Swann to Harris, no run very full, bit of air and drifting towards leg stump, turned to leg;
49.3;?;Swann to Harris, no run flighted, straight line, played back to the bowler;

48.6;?;Anderson to Harris, no run full and veering down the leg side, nearly knocks Harris off his feet, Dharmasena shakes his head. England decide that DRS has been good to them, and duly review ... only for Hawk-Eye to prove what the naked eye could see. In fact, the ball pitched outside leg, never mind the impact. Tsk;
48.5;?;Anderson to Harris, no run good length, on the stumps, blocked to leg;
48.4;?;Anderson to Harris, no run goes for the bumper, again the ball doesn't get up that high but Harris crams his big frame into a tight little ball underneath it;

48.2;?;Anderson to Harris, no run stays in the crease and blocks a shorter-length ball into the covers;

47.1;?;Swann to Harris, no run pushed through on the stumps, blocked into the off side;
46.6;1;Anderson to Harris, 1 run a big inducker from Anderson, full and homing on middle and leg, Harris plays around the front pad and picks up one through square;
46.5;3;Anderson to Pattinson, 3 runs another low edge screws away wide of third slip, Pattinson did well to keep it down and Jonny Bairstow does even better to keep them to three with a dive to the rope, almost swimming across the turf to fingertip it back in;
46.4;?;Anderson to Pattinson, no run short and at the man, Patto ducks underneath;
46.3;?;Anderson to Pattinson, no run good length and seaming across the left-hander, who leaves;

45.4;W;Swann to Haddin, OUT goes for the big mow over midwicket but he's edged to slip! Trott clings on gleefully to this chance and Haddin departs after a tortuous 42-ball knock, trying to go on the attack again, heaving across the line and the ball popping off the top edge down near the toe;Brad Haddin c Trott b Swann 7 (61m 42b 1x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
45.3;?;Swann to Haddin, no run stands up and defends into the pitch around off;

45.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run flat trajectory, worked off the pads to leg;
44.6;?;Anderson to Pattinson, no run pitched up and Pattinson gets behind this to defend square;
44.5;?;Anderson to Pattinson, no run beaten outside off, a teaser to begin with that pitched on middle and seams away as the batsman prodded at it;
44.4;W;Anderson to Siddle, OUT he fishes and is caught at second slip, Siddle goes! That was a real tailender's shot, the ball might have held its line a touch but Siddy tamely steered it low to Swann off the open face. So now Anderson is amongst them too - and, in fairness to Siddle, it was the old disguised reverse swinger, which Anderson deploys so expertly these days;Peter Siddle c Swann b Anderson 2 (38m 24b 0x4 0x6) SR: 8.33;
44.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run goes across his stumps and prods a fullish ball towards mid-on;

43.5;?;Swann to Haddin, no run gets forward and dabs defensively to leg;
43.4;4;Swann to Haddin, FOUR runs that's a smart shot from Haddin and well executed, plants the foot and sweeps hard with the turn, shouts of "catch it!" but there's no fielder near and it skips to the midwicket boundary;
43.3;1;Swann to Siddle, 1 run full and wide of the stumps, Siddle sweeps competently through backward square for another single;
43.2;?;Swann to Siddle, no run on the stumps, turned to midwicket;

39.1;?;Swann to Siddle, no run Siddle leans forward to defend;
38.6;W;Anderson to Haddin, OUT oh dear! Agar has been run out! What a terrible mix-up! At first glance it appears Haddin has let his partner down here. It was shortish on the hips and lobbed up, perhaps off the body, behind square leg. Prior ran around to collect and Agar was running through for a single. It was Agar's call as it was behind the batsman, but Haddin didn't respond. He barely even left his crease. Agar made it three quarters of the way down the pitch and almost all the way back, but the throw was collected by Anderson who whipped the bails off.;Ashton Agar run out (?Prior/Anderson) 2 (28m 21b 0x4 0x6) SR: 9.52;

37.3;?;Swann to Agar, no run sharp turn out of the footmarks - it has spun all the way to first slip! Agar wasn't interested in trying to hit that;

36.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run solidly defended by Haddin, no swing for Anderson;
36.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run a big lbw appeal from Anderson now, he's keen but the umpire is not, and nor is Matt Prior. What a system England have in place! That was comfortably sailing down leg and too high to boot;
36.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run fullish and on line, Haddin drives towards mid-on;
35.6;?;Swann to Agar, no run solid in defence from Agar;

34.6;?;Anderson to Agar, no run angled across Agar again, and he defends;
34.5;?;Anderson to Agar, no run pushed away towards point;
34.4;?;Anderson to Agar, no run awkwardly defended this time, Agar looks a bit hampered by this sore hip that he has. He's certainly missing a bit of the joie de vivre he displayed at Trent Bridge;

31.1;?;Swann to Haddin, no run turns in towards the stumps and Haddin defends;
30.6;W;Broad to Clarke, OUT Broad has got the huge wicket of Clarke! Massive! That's a fine delivery, not quite yorker-length but almost, and straight - Clarke plays the wrong line and that's struck him on the pad, the umpire gives it lbw. Australia have no reviews left but it's of no consequence - there was no inside edge and that was dead in front.;Michael Clarke lbw b Broad 28 (57m 41b 4x4 0x6) SR: 68.29;
30.6;1w;Broad to Clarke, 1 wide bouncer, but it's too high to worry Clarke. It has worried umpire Dharmasena, though. He calls it wide.;

30.3;?;Broad to Clarke, no run swinging in a touch now and Clarke defends;
30.2;4;Broad to Clarke, FOUR runs that, however, is a much better stroke. A bit shorter from Broad and Clarke whips this pull dismissively through midwicket, fine timing and placement;
30.1;?;Broad to Clarke, no run Clarke flashes at this outside off! Didn't move the feet at all, and that has beaten the outside edge. You have to wonder if Clarke has decided he's going to go after the bowlers;
29.6;?;Swann to Haddin, no run on the back foot, Haddin nudges it down into the ground to Bell;
29.5;W;Swann to Smith, OUT Smith is gone! Swann gets some extra bounce and that does for Smith, it lobs off his gloves and is snapped up by short leg! That was a pretty sharp take as well from Ian Bell, he had to go low to the ground;Steven Smith c Bell b Swann 2 (26m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;
29.4;?;Swann to Smith, no run Smith uses his feet too - he's the best player of spin besides Clarke around the Australian group at the moment - and clips it to midwicket;

28.6;?;Broad to Smith, no run again Broad bangs it in short, again Smith ducks it comfortably;
28.5;?;Broad to Smith, no run bouncer again, and Smith ducks it;
28.4;3;Broad to Clarke, 3 runs nicely played by Clarke, it was short of a length and he drives off the back foot between cover and mid-off, it looks like running away for a boundary but Bresnan does well to reel that in;

26.5;?;Broad to Clarke, no run bumper, outside off, Clarke eschews the shot on this occasion;
26.4;4;Broad to Clarke, FOUR runs very full and in the slot, Clarke drives again, gets a good chunk of the ball and it beats Bresnan's dive moving to his left at mid-off, four more;

25.6;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run floated up on the leg stump, gets forward and flicks round the corner for one mpre;
25.5;4;Swann to Clarke, FOUR runs drops slightly short, room for Clarke to free the arms and crack a cut shot in front of point, that came off the bat like a bullet;

25.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run full and straight, chipped back towards mid-on;

23.5;W;Swann to Khawaja, OUT Khawaja on the charge, he's hit this over the top... except it doesn't go over, it merely loops high off the toe and into the hands of KP at mid-off! He hasn't looked comfortable against Swann, surviving a drop at slip and defending somewhat anxiously in front of his pad, obviously decided he didn't want to die in a hole - so he perished in no-man's land instead;Usman Khawaja c Pietersen b Swann 14 (46m 35b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40;
23.4;?;Swann to Khawaja, no run full, flighted, defended in front of off;

21.5;4;Swann to Khawaja, FOUR runs back round the wicket, arm ball drifting on to the pads and Khawaja plays it well, from deep in the crease and glancing it fine for a boundary;
21.4;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run tossed up around the line of off, punched into the off side, to the left of mid-off and they steal one;
21.3;1;Swann to Khawaja, 1 run drifts to leg, closes the face and clips one past the attendant close fielder;

20.2;?;Bresnan to Clarke, no run back of a length in the channel outside off, doesn't do much off the pitch and Clarke lets it through;
20.1;1;Bresnan to Khawaja, 1 run stays back and drops into the off side, they scamper one but Bairstow swoops on it and hits one stumps from square! They go upstairs to the third umpire again, but Clarke is quick across the ground and was just in;
19.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run angled in with the arm, minimal turn and Clarke defends in front of off;

19.1;?;Swann to Khawaja, no run tossed up, defended back down the track;
18.6;W;Bresnan to Hughes, OUT Hughes throws his hands at a wide one, very loose shot from a new batsman, there's a limp sort of appeal, particularly from Bresnan but it's immediately upheld by Dharmasena! Hughes reviews without hesitation, so he must be pretty confident he didn't hit it... So, let's see if there's evidence to overturn the decision. Hot Spot is pretty inconclusive, maybe a faint mark, there was a sound on the audio and Tony Hill decides there's not enough proof to overrule Dharmasena to the decision stands - Australia have lost 3 for 11!;Phillip Hughes c ?Prior b Bresnan 1 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 12.5;

17.6;?;Swann to Khawaja, no run floated up and defended coming forwards;
17.5;?;Swann to Khawaja, no run a big lbw appeal this time, bat thrust forward next to pad, hard to tell which took the impact first and might have been outside the line of off, Erasmus shakes his head;
17.4;?;Swann to Khawaja, no run tossed up and blocked pressing forwards;
17.3;?;Swann to Khawaja, no run dropped, a dolly for Trott at first slip! Khawaja pushes at a regulation offbreak and guided it into the fielder's hands but it popped straight out of the confectionery stand and to the turf;
17.2;?;Swann to Khawaja, no run angled in and defended;
17.1;?;Swann to Khawaja, no run dances forward and manages to jam his gloves down on to at as the ball threatens to spins past him;

15.3;1;Swann to Hughes, 1 run tossed up outside off and pushed into a gap in the covers first ball;
15.2;W;Swann to Rogers, OUT what on earth has happened here? He's missed a full toss and been hit in front ... Erasmus raises a finger and England have another, though both batsman and bowler are shaking their heads! This is like the tactic of bowling a slow full toss on Brian Lara Cricket, though there was no intent on Swann's part. The ball slipped out of the hand and Rogers was slow to sight it, missed swinging across the line and got hit on the box, I think... in front of middle and leg, though Rogers was probably anxious not to lose the second review. Hawk-Eye shows, however, that it would have missed leg stump! This is a rum old dismissal on many levels;Chris Rogers lbw b Swann 15 (65m 45b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
15.1;?;Swann to Rogers, no run tossed up and defended into the off side;
14.6;?;Bresnan to Khawaja, no run good, probing line, on a length and drawing Khawaja forwards, he opens the face and steers to point;
14.5;?;Bresnan to Khawaja, no run slightly back of a length, in the corridor, Khawaja drops back and shoulders arms;
14.4;3;Bresnan to Rogers, 3 runs on the pads, touch fuller this time and Rogers neatly picks him off between midwicket and mid-on;
14.3;?;Bresnan to Rogers, no run straighter, worked off the pads towards midwicket, no run;
14.2;?;Bresnan to Rogers, no run length ball, around off stump, steered toward point;
14.1;3;Bresnan to Khawaja, 3 runs not much footwork and Khawaja fences away from his body, a thick edge flies low through the gully region, Cook gives chase and prevents four;
13.6;?;Swann to Rogers, no run goes back to a wide delivery and pokes it square on the off side;
13.5;?;Swann to Rogers, no run full and flighted, straightening a touch outside off as Rogers leaves;
13.4;?;Swann to Rogers, no run more spin as Rogers leans out, covers the line and drives to backward point;
13.3;?;Swann to Rogers, no run tossed up and defended;
13.2;?;Swann to Rogers, no run tossed up and this rags hard past the outside edge as Rogers plays from the crease;
13.1;?;Swann to Rogers, no run tapped into the off side and this very nearly results in Rogers running himself out, as Khawaja sends him back! He had to do a U-turn in the middle of the pitch as the throw came in - a direct hit would have done for him;
12.6;2;Bresnan to Khawaja, 2 runs drops short, at the body, Khawaja nudges it away through square leg and they get back for a couple;
12.5;?;Bresnan to Khawaja, no run good length, pushed across and defended on the front foot outside off;
12.4;W;Bresnan to Watson, OUT Bresnan strikes! He has Watson lbw in the last over before lunch! Great ball, angled in and Watson moved across with the front pad and missed the ball, he's rapped right in front and Dharmasena gives it lbw. Watson chats for a while with Rogers and eventually makes the decision to review it. It's a poor decision because that was plumb. That's not how to use the review system;Shane Watson lbw b Bresnan 30 (57m 42b 6x4 0x6) SR: 71.42;
12.3;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run shoulders arms again;
12.2;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run swinging in this time and Watson leaves it alone;
12.1;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run angled in towards off, he's looking for the lbw in this over, but Watson defends;
11.6;?;Swann to Rogers, no run slow stuff from Swann and Rogers defends;
11.5;2;Swann to Rogers, 2 runs more flight this time and it's fuller, Rogers drives square through point. He's not finding the boundary like Watson but he's looking solid;
11.4;2;Swann to Rogers, 2 runs wristy from Rogers now as Swann drops short and angles it in to off stump, it's flicked away through midwicket;
11.3;?;Swann to Rogers, no run drifting in from around the wicket, Rogers defends;
11.2;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run shorter from Swann, Watson tucks it away behind square leg;

10.6;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run solid in defence again;
10.5;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run defended away to the leg side;
10.4;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run bangs in the bouncer from around the wicket, Rogers ducks under it with a distinct lack of concern;
10.3;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run better line outside off and it's defended to cover;
10.2;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run defended back to Anderson;
10.1;2;Anderson to Rogers, 2 runs swings in towards the pads and Rogers just clips it along the ground out towards deep square;
9.6;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run Watson gets back to defends this straight one;
9.5;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run better line and length, Watson defends to off;
9.4;2;Bresnan to Watson, 2 runs strays on to the pads this time and Watson flicks it away towards deep square leg, there is a man back there so this one doesn't add to his boundary tally;
9.3;4;Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs another boundary! The runs are flowing, Bresnan gives him some more width now and Watson cuts this one away fine, well behind point, easy runs;
9.2;?;Bresnan to Watson, no run straighter line and Watson defends;
9.1;4;Bresnan to Watson, FOUR runs Watson is really on song now! No swing for Bresnan and Watson just pushes this drive through extra cover, it was in the spot but still the placement was good. Yet another boundary;
8.6;3;Anderson to Watson, 3 runs yet more runs for Watson, this time he stands tall and off the back foot steers it behind point, it appears to be running away to the boundary but Jonny Bairstow has done magnificently in his chase and dive, flicks it back in to the field of play with his left hand - just within the bounds of play;
8.5;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs again Watson drives nicely through off, this time from a ball not quite so full and it's more the timing of this one than strength, he's found the gap between point and cover;
8.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run Anderson brings the length back just a touch, Watson leans forward and across to defend;
8.3;?;Anderson to Watson, no run solidly defended to the off side;
8.2;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs that's a classic Watson drive, he gets the big stride in and makes the ball fuller than it might otherwise have been, and he punches the drive through extra cover with power and timing;

7.6;?;Bresnan to Rogers, no run whippy flick to square leg to end the over;
7.5;?;Bresnan to Rogers, no run on the pads and Rogers clips it to midwicket;

7.2;?;Bresnan to Rogers, no run probing on off stump, no real swing for Bresnan, and Rogers defends;
7.1;2;Bresnan to Rogers, 2 runs fullish and outside off, just put on the spot by Bresnan, and Rogers drives past mid-off to pick up some more runs;
6.6;?;Anderson to Watson, no run Watson looks good with this drive, straight bat and firmly struck, but Pietersen at mid-on prevents any runs;
6.5;?;Anderson to Watson, no run swinging in towards off now, Watson defends with bat and pad close together;
6.4;3;Anderson to Rogers, 3 runs Rogers pushes this one back past Anderson, just a little jab really, but good enough to pick up three as the batsmen scamper through quickly;
6.3;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run "Wait, wait ... wait, wait!" shouts Chris Rogers after he pushes this to point. In the end, that's all the batsmen do;
6.2;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run left alone outside off again;
6.1;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run Anderson sends this down at 85.3mph, it's left alone outside off,;
5.6;?;Broad to Watson, no run left alone outside off now;
5.5;?;Broad to Watson, no run fuller and swinging in a touch now, another stifled shout for lbw, this too was off a thick inside edge;
5.4;?;Broad to Watson, no run tries for another off drive now but straight to mid-off;
5.3;4;Broad to Watson, FOUR runs super shot from Watson now, fullish from Broad and Watson pounces with an off-drive that is more muscle than finesse, but races away to the boundary in any case;

5.1;?;Broad to Watson, no run Watson defends from outside off;
4.6;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run defended away to the leg side again;
4.5;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run on off stump now and Rogers defends to leg;
4.4;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run another one down leg, this one flicks the pad on the way through to Prior, who dives and collects it;
4.3;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run wrong line again from Anderson, swinging down leg and Rogers can't get anything on it;
4.2;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run strikes Rogers on the pad now but this was pitching well outside leg as Anderson is over the wicket;
4.1;?;Anderson to Rogers, no run Anderson is, clearly, back on the field now, but swings this ball way down leg;
3.6;?;Broad to Watson, no run there's an appeal for lbw, it is turned down by Marais Erasmus. England appeared confident but after a conference between bowler, keeper and captain, they decide not to review and it's another wise call. That looked like it struck Watson outside the line of off, and replays confirm it.;
3.5;?;Broad to Watson, no run angled in to the off stump line now and Watson defends;
3.4;?;Broad to Watson, no run probing outside off now but no real swing there and Watson defends solidly;
3.3;?;Broad to Watson, no run curving away outside off and Watson theatrically leaves the ball alone;
3.2;1;Broad to Rogers, 1 run Rogers gets off the mark now with a flick through midwicket from a ball that swings in;
3.1;?;Broad to Rogers, no run angled across Rogers, who leaves it alone;
2.6;?;Anderson to Watson, no run wider of off now and Watson slashes, he's missed it;
2.5;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs first boundary for Australia now as Watson waits on a slightly shorter one and steers it off the back foot down into the ground and away behind point;
2.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run another thick edge from Watson, but soft hands means this doesn't carry to second slip;
2.3;?;Anderson to Watson, no run not so good a delivery now, angling down the leg side and Watson's attempted glance doesn't connect;
2.2;?;Anderson to Watson, no run plays late this time and defends safely;
2.1;?;Anderson to Watson, no run great bowling from Anderson, fast and swinging away a fraction, from middle stump and Watson is naturally squared up. Gets a thickish edge away to off;
1.6;?;Broad to Rogers, no run squared up now and Rogers pushes to off;
1.5;?;Broad to Rogers, no run ouch, Rogers is beaten by one that nips in a fraction and bounces - it's struck him fair in the midriff;
1.4;?;Broad to Rogers, no run outside off now and Rogers defends with a straight bat;
1.3;?;Broad to Rogers, no run again it's curling down leg, again Rogers makes no contact;
1.2;?;Broad to Rogers, no run swinging down the leg side now and Rogers tries to tickle it fine but gets nothing on it;
1.1;?;Broad to Rogers, no run good line straight away, just outside off and swinging in a touch, and Rogers defends;
0.6;?;Anderson to Watson, no run inswing this time and it moves late, good bowling from Anderson, but Watson is still able to leave it alone safely as it doesn't move enough to threaten his off stump;
0.5;?;Anderson to Watson, no run accurate stuff from Anderson and Watson defends;
0.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run Watson shoulders arms now;
0.3;?;Anderson to Watson, no run lovely delivery! Oh what a cracker for Watson to have to negotiate in this first over! It's on middle and off and just curving away a fraction, Anderson puts up a huge shout for caught behind but Kumar Dharmasena says not out. Anderson wants a review, but the consensus from the England players is not to go for it, and that's a wise call. It was off the back leg, not bat;
0.2;?;Anderson to Watson, no run Watson shapes to play at this but then brings the bat back inside;
0.1;?;Anderson to Watson, no run left alone outside off;

Extraordinary that in this series, fifth-wicket pairs are the only ones that have been more productive than last-wicket partnerships. Here's a first-wicket pairing now, out walk Shane Watson and Chris Rogers for Australia's innings. James Anderson to begin.
 Innings Start
Alastair Cook has led out his England team, out come the umpires and the Australia opening batsmen.
If my maths is correct, there are 173 overs left in this Test match. Australia have got to break it down into small portions to have any chance. AB: "Time for Australia to channel their inner du Plessis." Interesting comment from Shane Warne, who has said he would have told Smith to drop that catch to keep Root out there.
So Root's chance for a double confirmed as England's early aim this morning, that didn't happen so after 15 minutes their innings is closed. Fantastic innings from Root. For the record, Australia need 583 to win. They need to bat basically two days to save the match. It's what Richie Benaud would call a 'closure' rather than a declaration.
114.1;W;Harris to Root, OUT no double for Root! He falls in the cause, trying to scoop this length ball over the the keeper or fine-leg, instead it flies down to third man who takes a good catch. And straight away England declare;Joe Root c Smith b Harris 180 (466m 338b 18x4 2x6) SR: 53.25;

111.1;1;Agar to Bairstow, 1 run over the wicket, outside leg stump, nudged off the pads behind square on the leg side;

Credit to Australia's bowlers, they haven't bowled much poor stuff today
 Innings Start
Right'oh, we're tuckered out in the cricinfo bunker, so it's time to bid you all farewell until Thursday week. England are 2-0 up in the Ashes for first time since 1986-87 and have now won four Tests in a row against Australia for the first time since 1928. If you can't stomach an evening without ball-by-ball, Pakistan are about to set off in pursuit of West Indies 261 for 7 in St Lucia (but don't feel like you have to) - apologies if you're having problems accessing other areas of the site, too, as we've had a few technical difficulties. From Gnasher, Brydon, Alex and myself, cheerio for now.
7pm: Australia captain, Michael Clarke: "Certainly not the performance we were after, we've got some time to make amends and we've got to work hard in the nets and prepare for Manchester. We have to win the last three Tests now. Of course it is [possible to win all three], we have to improve, but it would be silly to say we will. Credit to England, they played very well and deserved to win. The first innings let us down, to make 130 you're going to find yourselves in a very hard position against a good team. We're putting extra pressure on our bowlers. Our top seven has a lot of experience and we haven't performed as we'd like. When we lose one wicket, we're losing several. If we can make some runs [against Sussex] and take that momentum into the third Test I'm sure that will help us."
England captain, Alastair Cook: "All the boys were keen [to finish it today]. A bit of hard work and the chances came. We've had to scrap hard, being 30 for 3 in both innings, Belly's hundred and Root's hundred came after working hard at the beginning. When it is dry, we've got a world-class spinner in Swanny and the bowlers can reverse it - we're pretty confident in all English conditions. We all know what a great player [Root] is and it's fantastic that he's shown that at the top of the order. [KP] is just a strain but we want to take care of it and not do any further damage."
Joe Root is named Man of the Match: "I've loved every minute of it, great to get a win. There's a bit of tape [on the honours board], I'd like to see [my name] up there properly. I'd say this one [is better than maiden Test century], it's great to get a hundred in the Ashes. It's nice to contribute [with the ball too], you get an opportunity and you want to take it and it's nice to help the side as much as you can. Every time you go out to bat is an opportunity to contribute, I tried to get through it early on and have a bit of fun later."
6.45pm: Pattinson and Harris extended the innings by 43 - that's 295 for Australia's last wicket in the series now - but, after pushing their food around the plate with a fork for what seemed like an eternity, England have gobbled up this Test. The end may have come with a bit of a whimper but, make no mistake, this is a crushing defeat; by the margin of runs in the fourth innings, it is Australia's third heaviest. When Darren Lehmann said he wanted his players to have fun, this wasn't what he meant. Plans will have to be redrawn for Old Trafford, starting in a three-day game against Sussex, but there's a danger that the psychological effects will wreath themselves around each of the last three Tests. England only need to draw one of them to retain the Ashes but they will be looking at a straight knockout - not in a bar at 2am but with the eyes of the cricket world watching. You'll find David Hopps' more august appraisal on the site shortly and I'll bring the presentations in a mo...

61.6;W;Swann to Haddin, OUT but he's struck now! Haddin pads this away and is given lbw.

54.5;W;Bresnan to Agar, OUT is it an edge? Huge appeal. England review. Full outside off, Agar went for the drive, the appeal came straight away but Erasmus said not out. Cook reviewed instantly. Nothing on Hot Spot this time. Think he'll survive here. No! He's been given! Oh goodness. Agar can't believe it. It won't change the course of the game, but another umpire talking point. Apparently the third umpire said there was a clear deflection and a noise. Not sure that was conclusive evidence?;Ashton Agar c ?Prior b Bresnan 16 (13m 13b 4x4 0x6) SR: 123.07;
54.4;?;Bresnan to Agar, no run again a hint of width, short of a length, and it's cut but this time he picks out backward point;

50.6;?;Bresnan to Agar, no run defended towards point;
50.5;W;Bresnan to Smith, OUT Smith is gone! Caught behind! He quickly asks for a review of Marais Erasmus' decision, indicating that he must have genuinely thought he had not edged that. However, Hot Spot shows there is indeed a little nick on the inside edge of the bat! Just a faint one, but a clear one all the same, and Smith is indeed gone. Bresnan has got him with the scrambled-seam delivery.;Steven Smith c ?Prior b Bresnan 1 (19m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 7.14;
50.5;1w;Bresnan to Smith, 1 wide another bouncer, this time Smith shapes to hook and then opts not to play - Marais Erasmus has called that a wide, which I think is harsh - Smith could have played that had he wanted to;

49.2;?;Root to Khawaja, no run tossed up and turning away outside off, left alone;
49.1;?;Root to Khawaja, no run Root strikes again! Or does he? A drive outside off and this has been taken by slip. Dharmasena says not out, but England review. Well, that moved so far off the pitch that you can understand England's excitement, but it was all turn from Root - no bat involved, although it was close to kissing the edge. Khawaja lives to fight on!;

47.3;?;Root to Smith, no run quicker and on the pads, Smith defends to leg;
47.2;W;Root to Clarke, OUT and leg slip has done the trick! Oh, what a wicket for the part-timer Joe Root! Leg slip had only just come in and Root, around the wicket, pitched it outside leg and turning further away, Clarke tried to glance it away and it's run off the face of the bat to Cook at leg slip.;Michael Clarke c Cook b Root 51 (122m 85b 7x4 0x6) SR: 60;
47.1;?;Root to Clarke, no run down leg side from around the wicket and no bat or pad connects;

45.6;4;Root to Khawaja, FOUR runs bad ball and well done Usman Khawaja to pounce on that, he pulls a low long hop that fizzes just past Ian Bell, turning to avoid permanent damage at short leg, and through midwicket and it runs away to the boundary;

45.4;?;Root to Khawaja, no run defended back towards the bowler;
45.3;?;Root to Khawaja, no run appeals from England now as Khawaja prods forward and it lobs up to slip - the umpire says not out and rightly so - that has turned so sharply out of the footmarks that it's missed the bat by some distance. England don't review it;
45.2;?;Root to Khawaja, no run beaten outside off as this one turns just enough - well, actually, too much;
45.1;1;Root to Clarke, 1 run tossed up on the stumps and it's clipped through leg;
44.6;?;Anderson to Khawaja, no run trying to tempt Khawaja outside off but he is showing far more patience than he did in the first innings and leaves it alone;

43.1;?;Root to Khawaja, no run tossed up outside off and Khawaja defends;
42.6;1;Anderson to Khawaja, 1 run fullish and swinging away, Khawaja does oblige with the drive but is good enough to get it along the ground to cover-point, can't get more than a single though;
42.5;?;Anderson to Khawaja, no run angling in this time, not away from Khawaja, but he's good enough to defend it with a straight bat;
42.4;?;Anderson to Khawaja, no run defended solidly to the off side;
42.3;?;Anderson to Khawaja, no run crowd catch! Yorker outside off and Khawaja jams down on the ball, which hits the ground and lobs up to point - the fielder runs in and takes the "catch", throwing it in the air to lure the crowd into a cheer;
42.2;4;Anderson to Khawaja, FOUR runs too full and straight, and Khawaja is good enough to clip this off his pads and through the gap at midwicket, a really attractive stroke;
42.1;?;Anderson to Khawaja, no run Anderson is around the wicket to Khawaja, trying to move it away from the left-hander, who leaves it alone;
41.6;3;Swann to Khawaja, 3 runs shortish and stays low, Khawaja manages to get his pull away over square leg, although it looked a little top-edgey - it's chased down just inside the boundary;

41.4;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run fuller from Swann, Clarke tucks it through midwicket;
