Data
Australia have been kept to 327, a superb effort from England led by their two senior bowlers with Anderson and Broad sharing seven wickets. Remember, Australia were 102 for 0 at lunch yesterday and 243 for 3 at the start today. That's the fewest first innings overs England have bowled away from home since October 2016. Now it's over to their batting. Can they bed in on a sluggish pitch, will Australia get the reverse England found? Back in a few minutes
SRK: "There'll be two key aspects to England's batting: getting through the first spells from Hazlewood, Cummins, Bird, and then how they cope with Lyon and Marsh. Smith won't want his fast men having to bowl long, frequent spells in the brutal afternoon heat."
118.6;W;Anderson to Lyon, OUT full, straight given...Lyon has reviewed but he's also walking off! Does swing quite late. Probably clipping leg stump at worse. Certainly no edge. Umpire's call on hitting leg stump. Taking a decent chunk of it;Nathan Lyon lbw b Anderson 0 (17m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
118.5;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run attempted yorker, slips down the leg side as a swinging full toss;

115.3;?;Broad to Lyon, no run full outside off, slides off a thickish outside edge towards gully;
115.2;W;Broad to Cummins, OUT edged, taken low down at slip! Nicely done by Broad, pushing full outside off, Cummins goes for the drive, the edge reaches Cook very low. And now the umpires are checking if it's carried. The soft signal is out. Cummins is almost off the ground. Safely into the hands. Well taken by Cook. That will be a quick confirmation by the third umpire.;Pat Cummins c Cook b Broad 4 (30m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22;
115.1;?;Broad to Cummins, no run full at off stump, defended to cover;
114.6;1;Anderson to Cummins, 1 run forward and tapped through third man;
114.5;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run tailing in late, but Cummins is equal to it, waiting for the ball to arrive before committing;

 Innings Start
10.40am Players back in the middle, the sun is breaking through. Pete: "So do Australia head out trying to secure the draw? It's not something they're good at applying themselves towards." Well, they earned a hard-fought one in India earlier this year
Tom: "Overcast conditions can change a game in England but mean nothing in Australia with the Kooka ball - not worth mentioning! "
10.37am Pfitzy: "Anderson and Broad will be licking their lips if there is a bit of cloud around. New ball in hand, and I reckon Smith will be batting before drinks to save the game."
Andrew Price: "Good time to remember Gooch carrying his bat against the WI at Headingly in 1991. One of the least appreciate, great innings of all time. A big score, in a low scoring game, against a true fast attack. Criminally under appreciated." Not sure it was under appreciated. Ranked the greatest innings of all time under a lot of metrics!
Cook walked on a few moments ago, and now he walks off to another ovation having carried his bat - the highest ever score to do so. Cummins finishes for four wickets, a good effort after his illness. But, given the overcast conditions, probably not the worst thing for England. Get bowling.
Moose: "You would have to say, Australia's Day by far today. Dominating"
144.1;W;Cummins to Anderson, OUT well, it's taken just one ball! Round the wicket, short of a length at the body, and Anderson just turn it into the hands of Bancroft at short leg. Perfect for Australia;James Anderson c Bancroft b Cummins 0 (27m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
143.6;?;Marsh to Cook, no run pushed down the pitch to complete England's finest day of the series.;

142.5;?;Bird to Anderson, no run hopping down the leg side;
142.4;?;Bird to Anderson, no run half an appeal as Bird targets the stumps. Nothing doing;

139.4;?;Cummins to Cook, no run punched to cover;
139.3;?;Cummins to Cook, no run short, and pumped out to square leg. Excellent timing, but too good for the circumstances. No time to return for the second so they opt out of the single;

137.5;W;Cummins to Broad, OUT slashed high and hard into the deep ... Khawaja hurtles round to scoop a tremendous take, low to the ground. The umpires are conferring to make sure it carried... but the soft signal is out, so let's see ... nope, that has burst through his hands on impact, so Broad will bat on! Or will he? They are taking an age to overturn it, and the upshot is that the TV replay is inconclusive! That's a very controversial finish, reminiscent of a Steve Waugh catch off Lara in the Caribbean some years ago - 1998-99, I believe;Stuart Broad c Khawaja b Cummins 56 (88m 63b 8x4 1x6) SR: 88.88;

135.5;?;Cummins to Cook, no run tighter line, patted back to the bowler;

Nimesh Nambiar: "How much of a lead are we calling a good one from here? 100?" Any lead is a good lead given the series England have had, but they really must make this one count. Wouldn't fancy making many in the fourth innings if the pitch gets slower and more two-paced
