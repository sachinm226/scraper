Data
Great comeback job from Sri Lanka's bowlers there, Malinga ends with four well-deserved wickets. Good fielding throughout on the whole, with the exception of a few drops. Gilchrist did really well in his final ODI at the WACA with a well-worked hundred, replete with plenty of singles. But around the time when he was aiming for his ton, the run rate began to slow and Sri Lanka did well to keep the pressure on. Stay with us for the chase.

49.3;1b;Malinga to Bracken, 1 bye follows him down leg, swing and miss from more backing away, they take the bye which is naughty and Sangakkara's huge underarm loop one-two with Malinga nearly results in the run-out at the non-striker's;

Ishara Amerasinghe hasn't recovered in time for this match.
1.15pm There's a banner up which says: "Gilly, made at the WACA." It is, of course, his last international at his home ground. There are murals for fans to sign and 10,000 "Thx Gilly" gloves will be given out.
1.00pm It's overcast at the WACA but the forecast is clear. Play will begin in half an hour's time.
12.45pm local time Hello everyone and welcome along to coverage of Australia's latest CB Series match against Sri Lanka in Perth. A win for the visitors would see them top the table while Australia are itching to get another one over on them after beating them last week. Australia are the favourites as well.
Look out Ricky Ponting, meanwhile. His opposing captain Mahela Jayawardene said yesterday that Ponting was going to be their target and that they would also seek out Australia's other batting frailties. That's fighting talk.
No team or toss news as of yet but I'll bring you them ASAP, I being Jenny Thompson, welcome.
 Innings Start
Australia, then, ease to the top of the table after their bowlers proved too much for Sri Lanka's batting line-up, with even Sangakkara finding the pressure too great having made 80.
Gilchrist takes the applause from the crowd who are all on their feet to celebrate his dinal international match at the ground he made his home. What a way to finish, with his 16th ODI ton.
Jayawardene is paying tribute to Gilchrist. "He batted really well, credit to him. Quite a few occasions he's been a menace. He's one of those players that you probably want to see the back of pretty quickly. He batted really well, credit to him.
"Kumar batted really well. The bowlers did well, too. It's a tough tournament, you have to be ready for the next game."
Here's Ponting: "Our bowlers were terrific again. Gilly obviously played beautifully today, the rest of us have got a bit of work to do with the bat. I sent a couple of messages out to him to make sure he was there at the end of the innings."
Gilchrist is the man of the match, unsurprisingly. "It is amazing. Look, it's been a great journey. A few trials, tribulations, but it's just been wonderful. I want to say thank you for the WACA crowd.
"I must acknowledge I really felt it [pressure] more than any other game. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. There's some big games coming up."
Huge rapturous applause now for Gilchrist who deserves each and every cheer. Great way to sign off at the WACA.
Thanks for joining me today, do tune in again on Sunday for more from the CB Series.

14.1;?;Hopes to Sangakkara, no run defended first up;
13.6;W;Bracken to Silva, OUT outside off and there's a contender for catch of the season, Silva lashes a full-blooded cover drive to Symonds who pulls off an audacious take, diving low and really stretching out his left hand to get under it;Chamara Silva c Symonds b Bracken 0 (11m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

12.5;?;Johnson to Sangakkara, no run late swing away from the left hander, a good length too, and he waits before defending on the front foot;
12.4;?;Johnson to Sangakkara, no run winged down off once more, a fraction wider, but the same results from the batsman - a leave;
12.3;?;Johnson to Sangakkara, no run down the channel again, more swing, the batsman is quick to shoulder arms and hold his bat high for a while making sure the ball has gone through. It had and then some;
12.2;?;Johnson to Sangakkara, no run devious swing back in towards the left hander but the ball's still just down the channel;
12.1;?;Johnson to Sangakkara, no run outside off, Sangakkara comes forward and almost yorks himself outside the line to defend;
11.6;?;Bracken to Silva, no run a more convincing forward defensive this time;
11.5;?;Bracken to Silva, no run through him as he stabds a forward defensive and there's a cry from a noise as the bat hit the pad, certainly not the ball which leapt over the shoulder;
11.4;?;Bracken to Silva, no run defended on the front foot;
11.3;5;Bracken to Sangakkara, 5 runs nipped back fro outside off, pushed to mid-on and they get the single, Hogg has a go at the non-striker's end, it wouldn't have been out and the ball runs on for four overthrows;

11.1;?;Bracken to Sangakkara, no run tight, ever so tight on off, forcing the front-foot defensive to a decent-length ball;
10.6;?;Johnson to Silva, no run leaves his first ball through to the keeper;
10.5;W;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT but he's gone now, just as he was getting set, the ball pushed across him making him play, hint of movement off the seam and with some late swing once he was committed to the shot, taking a step and thick-edging to second slip where Ponting makes no mistake;Mahela Jayawardene c Ponting b Johnson 21 (27m 25b 4x4 0x6) SR: 84;
10.4;2;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, 2 runs pushed across him once more, a touch of room and some width, again he goes square with a drive just in front of point now;
10.3;4;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs outside off, dragged short and with plenty of room for him to latch onto a thunderous drive that races over the turf backward of point;
10.2;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run pushed through tighter this time, on the rise and with a hint of curve away - like a supermodel's hips, so not much - and left alone;
10.1;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run forced across the right hander from over the wicket, enough angle on that to be left alone, which he does with a shrug;
9.6;?;Bracken to Sangakkara, no run and a maiden, shoulders arms and leaves it alone;
9.5;?;Bracken to Sangakkara, no run slightly slower this time, 127kph, pushed to the covers;

8.6;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run outside off and left alone;

8.4;4;Johnson to Sangakkara, FOUR runs short and wide, Sangakkara latches on ferociously, moves into position and finds the gap through the covers, all the way for four, burns the grass;
8.3;?;Johnson to Sangakkara, no run cramped for room, deflects off the pads to the off side;
8.2;1;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run full and outside off, smashed to the covers but well fielded by Haddin, diving stop and a quick return;
8.1;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run left alone outside off;
7.6;?;Lee to Sangakkara, no run pushed to the off side, off the back foot;
7.5;1;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run flashed hard and a thick edge flies away to third man for a single;
7.4;4;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs lazy and elegant and sensational, few batsmen drive better than this man and he's creamed Lee towards the covers for four;
7.3;?;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run full and on middle and leg, fast one there, Lee is confident of the lbw appeal but the umpire is not convinced, Jayawardene indicates that he might have got an inside edge to that one, that looked close;
7.2;3;Lee to Sangakkara, 3 runs full and on middle, clipped away towards midwicket for three, super shot again;
7.1;4;Lee to Sangakkara, FOUR runs full and on off, spanked through cover for a gorgeous four, Sangakkara on the move here;
6.6;4;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs dropped, by Ponting at second slip, Jayawardene flashes loosely, not much feet movement there and gets a healthy edge that flies towards second slip, Ponting lunges towards it but can only parry it away (goal-keeper style) to the third man region. Four more but a lucky one;
6.5;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run straight and accurate, pushed off the back foot back to the bowler;
6.4;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run left alone, short of a good length ball outside off;
6.3;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run loose drive outside off, that ball was bowled to induce that shot, Mahela not moving his feet there;
6.2;3;Johnson to Sangakkara, 3 runs full and on middle stump again, Sangakkara is too wristy a player to miss out, smacks it towards midwicket for three;
6.1;?;Johnson to Sangakkara, no run full and on middle stump, Sangakkara walks across and whips it towards square leg. No single, though;
5.6;?;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run defended down the ground, not much pace off the pitch, looks like a good one for batting;
5.5;?;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run good length and a bit wide, laced away superbly off the back foot but Hussey is at point, stopping what was a certain four;
5.4;?;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run short of a length, pushed to the covers but there are usually no gaps there with Symonds lurking;
5.3;?;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run defended on the back foot;
5.2;4;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR runs super shot, Lee digs it in slightly short but Jayawardene is upto the challenge, flicking his wrists and lifting over the slips for four, the third man is a bit too wide and he can't get to it. Good use of Lee's pace from Mahela that time;
5.1;?;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, no run short of a length and hurrying Jayawardene, pushed to the leg side but no run;
4.6;1;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run short of a length and pacy again, thick outside edge but along the ground to third man for a single, fine over from Johnson;
4.5;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run short and nippy this time, 142kph, Jayawardene hurried by that one, drops his bottom hand right at the end as the ball trickles to the covers;
4.4;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run left alone outside off, angling from the left-armers angle away from the right-hander;
4.3;?;Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, no run full and on off, Jayawardene pushes to the covers and thinks of a run but Symonds is prowling there, dives and stops the single;
4.2;W;Johnson to Dilshan, OUT castled! 142kph from Johnson and that's a yorker length ball that swings in late, Dilshan goes for the expansive drive but is beaten all ends up, through the gate, door and kitchen onto the middle and off stump. That sound of ball hitting stumps (tling) isn't going to please Dilshan. The WACA is on fire.;Tillakaratne Dilshan b Johnson 11 (23m 13b 2x4 0x6) SR: 84.61;
4.1;?;Johnson to Dilshan, no run full and tapped to cover, the crowd thinks it's a catch but that was actually a bump ball, Symonds fumbles initially and gets in a direct hit, no point running on a misfield to him;
4.1;1w;Johnson to Dilshan, 1 wide rusty start there, big wide outside off from Johnson, he's bowling against the wind so he will need to get used to that;
3.6;4;Bracken to Sangakkara, FOUR runs exquisite and four all the way, full and outside off, Sangakkara leans into the shot and creams it through the covers for a beautiful four, all along the carpet for a four;
3.5;?;Bracken to Sangakkara, no run nice carry to the wicketkeeper, left alone again;
3.4;?;Bracken to Sangakkara, no run pushed off the back foot, down the ground;
3.3;?;Bracken to Sangakkara, no run slightly outside off, left alone;
3.2;1;Bracken to Dilshan, 1 run full and angled away towards the covers, brilliant stop by Symonds (who else?) and Hussey picks it up in a flash and tries to throw towards the non-striker's end, Dilshan would have had to go if that was a direct hit;
3.1;W;Bracken to Jayasuriya, OUT he's thrown it away, Jayasuriya charges down the track and tries to smack Bracken over extra-cover, can only get a thick outside edge, though, and pops a simple catch to third man. The fielder there is alert and nabs one of the most important wickets. Needless shot after such a good start. But Bracken won't be complaining;Sanath Jayasuriya c Hopes b Bracken 12 (14m 10b 2x4 0x6) SR: 120;
2.6;?;Lee to Dilshan, no run short of a length, punched off the back foot;
2.5;2;Lee to Dilshan, 2 runs another short one, and a pull this time, ferociously latches on to it, can't time it well and picks up a couple to fine leg;
2.5;1nb;Lee to Dilshan, (no ball) short one from Lee, but that's a no-ball, Dilshan lets it go but sees the umpire signals a free-hit. Time to throw caution to the wind;
2.4;?;Lee to Dilshan, no run on the middle stump, batsman tries to force it to the leg side but he's cramped for room, sees the ball drop close to him;
2.3;?;Lee to Dilshan, no run short and pacy, 145kph, Dilshan goes for the pull shot but doesn't read the length well, deflects off the pads to the slip cordon;
2.2;4;Lee to Dilshan, FOUR runs what a blitzer, full and on off, Dilshan smokes it off the front foot, super cover-drive for four and the WACA is too stunned here. Sri Lanka galloping away;
2.1;1;Lee to Jayasuriya, 1 run full and on off, Jayasuriya pushes to mid-off and races for a single;
1.6;1lb;Bracken to Jayasuriya, 1 leg bye on the pads and cramping him for room this time, deflects off the legs;
1.5;4;Bracken to Jayasuriya, FOUR runs down the leg side and tucked away, four good balls and this one, slightly off the mark, has been put away, trickles away to fine leg for four;
1.4;?;Bracken to Jayasuriya, no run good accurate bowling again, full and no room, pushed down the ground to mid-off;
1.3;?;Bracken to Jayasuriya, no run straight again, pushed towards cover;
1.2;?;Bracken to Jayasuriya, no run full and on middle this time, no room for Jayasuriya, 134kph but accurate, pushed back down the ground;
1.1;?;Bracken to Jayasuriya, no run full and on off, cramped a bit for room, patted to the leg side;
0.6;?;Lee to Dilshan, no run short and slightly wide, 147kph, left alone, what an opening over for Sri Lanka, 16 off it.;
0.5;3;Lee to Jayasuriya, 3 runs wide again and Jayasuriya whacks it over the covers again, what a flood first up, lobs onto the outfield and they get three;
0.4;4;Lee to Jayasuriya, FOUR runs spanked with the force of a marauder, short and wide from Lee and Jayasuriya upper-cuts it for four, a silence descends over the WACA, Sri Lanka on a roll;
0.3;5lb;Lee to Dilshan, 5 leg byes runs flowing freely here, they take a quick leg-bye to Haddin but a direct hit deflects off the stumps and runs away down the ground for four. Too easy first up.;
0.2;?;Lee to Dilshan, no run short of a length and straight this time, Dilshan on the back foot and defending down the ground;
0.1;4;Lee to Dilshan, FOUR runs What a start! full and on the pads, Dilshan cutely flicks it over backward square leg for a four, superb innovation at the top of the order;

We're back with the run-chase. Sri Lanka did really well to pick up wickets in the end, keeping Australia down to less than five an over. A good start here and they may be on their way to a special win. The pitch has been bouncy, though, and the new-ball bowlers wouldn't want to let the Sri Lankans off so easily. Brett Lee to start proceedings. Sanath Jayasuriya and Tillakaratne Dilshan walking up at the top of the order. Dilshan on strike. Here we go
