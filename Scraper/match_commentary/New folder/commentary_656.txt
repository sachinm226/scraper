118.2;W;Malinga to Clarke, OUT strangled down leg side! It was short in length, moving down the leg side, Clarke tries to glance it but gets a glove to it and the 'keeper dives acrobatically to his left to take a fab catch.;Michael Clarke c ?Jayawardene b Malinga 71 (174m 123b 8x4 0x6) SR: 57.72;

116.2;2;Fernando to Symonds, 2 runs short again, doesn't rise that much, Symonds pulls it away in the gap between backward square and midwicket;
116.1;1;Fernando to Clarke, 1 run close shave that, Clarke trying to flay away from his body, gets and inside edge that squirts to fine leg, short of a length ball that could have easily gone on to rattle the woodwork;
115.6;?;Murali to Symonds, no run quicker one this time, Symonds gets forward and parries it to the off side, needed to hurry a bit for that;
115.5;?;Murali to Symonds, no run offbreak this time, Symonds down the ground but it spins too sharp, he pads it away;

112.5;?;Fernando to Symonds, no run short again, this time starting on off and coming back in, good pace again, Symonds ducks under it this time. Good string of deliveries this. Can he set him up?;
112.4;?;Fernando to Symonds, no run better short one that time, closer to the body, 134kph and forcing Symonds to weave out of the way, good height too, about throat high;
112.3;?;Fernando to Symonds, no run short one, 138.3kph, Symonds lets that go, that was slightly wide of off and he didn't have to go for it;
112.2;3;Fernando to Clarke, 3 runs full again and that is scooped wonderfully through the midwicket gap for three, he plays that shot well Clarke, maybe worth putting a fielder in there;
112.1;?;Fernando to Clarke, no run full and straight, 125kph, pushed down the ground;
111.6;6;Murali to Symonds, SIX runs of course he should. Flighted from Murali and he's down the track in a flash, carting the ball way over the bowler's head for a biggie, massive hit that. He's in a hurry today Roy;

110.5;4;Fernando to Symonds, FOUR runs full this time and that was just a jab, not much power from him there but it races away. it tells you about his ability;
110.4;4;Fernando to Symonds, FOUR runs slightly wide and it gets the punishment, Symonds stands tall and blitzes it square for four, what a fierce cut that is, one of the hardest in the game;
110.3;?;Fernando to Symonds, no run good ball again, 139kph, full and straight, pushed down the ground by Symonds;
110.2;W;Fernando to Hussey, OUT Now where did that come from! 135kph, superb inswinging yorker from Fernando and it crashes into Hussey's front toe. He tries to dig it out but can't make allowance for the swing. Big appeal and the umpire's finger goes up straight away. Fernando has had a mixed day but this was a top-notch delivery. That was hitting the base of middle stump. Hussey departs to a standing ovation.;Michael Hussey lbw b Fernando 132 (282m 220b 18x4 1x6) SR: 60;

108.2;?;Fernando to Hussey, no run outside off and left alone, dribbles to the keeper;
108.1;4;Fernando to Hussey, FOUR runs drifting down the leg side and Hussey helps it along, thin tickle to fine leg and it races along. A bit of water on the ground but it passes the outfield without much fuss. The ball, though, has got wet.;
107.6;?;Murali to Clarke, no run down the leg side, padded away, the way Clarke did that was like a dainty lady playing badminton at her in-laws (don't ask me why);

107.3;?;Murali to Clarke, no run;
107.2;1;Murali to Hussey, 1 run goes for it again, this time he doesn't time it that well and settles for a single;
107.1;6;Murali to Hussey, SIX runs now then, thrown up outside off and Hussey brings out the slog sweep, on his knees and lofts it way over midwicket for a maximum, as crisp as it gets, catch goes down in the boundary, nobody can get this man out, it seems;

96.3;?;Malinga to Hussey, no run 131.9kph, now then, that was a teaser, just outside off and very close to the off stump, moves a shade away and Hussey judges it well to levae it, had that come in ...;

95.6;1;Fernando to Hussey, 1 run dabbed to the off side;
95.5;?;Fernando to Hussey, no run 126kph that one, a good slower ball, full and outside off, deceives Hussey and he nearly pops one back to mid-off, checks his shot and watches it fall in no-man's land at short mid-off;

95.1;?;Fernando to Clarke, no run a bit too short again, Clarke on the back foot and punching towards the covers, nto that well timed but this length isn't working, it seems. Not much bounce here and Fernando needs to be full and swingier (if there is any word like that);

91.3;?;Fernando to Clarke, no run pushes through outside off, Clarke content to leave that one;
91.2;?;Fernando to Clarke, no run oh, good movement back in to Clarke from Fernando, Clarke squidging down on that at the last minute, squidging being the technical term;

What consistency! Bradman-esque almost. Called Mr Cricket for his consistency, Hussey isn't letting up;

88.1;1b;Malinga to Clarke, 1 bye down the leg side, good stop by Prasanna behind the stumps, diving full length to his left but can't stop the one bye. The crowd are anticipating Hussey's hundred and cheer him on for every run;
87.6;4;Maharoof to Hussey, FOUR runs good ball, it beats him, bounces a bit extra and surprises Hussey but it's past the slip cordon and races away for the boundary, he moves on to 96 and he's probably going to reach his hundred by close;

86.1;?;Malinga to Hussey, no run full length ball, Hussey is beaten, trying to push tentatively, little noise but that is bat on pad, appeal from the bowler but Peter Parker says a firm "No";

Hussey needs 12 in 18 balls. He's on strike. Let's see how he plays it now.
 Innings Start
Now, interestingly Matthew Hayden dashed off towards the dressing room, suggesting that Australia will bat again. Ponting has decided not to enforce the follow on. Interesting decision. Join us in a bit.
Rahul has a go: "The bowlers have bowled 80 overs. I don't understand this trend of modern captains not to enforce the follow on(after the 'Laxman Test' in 2001). Dravid did the same at the Oval. The most ridiculous was Ponting's decision to bat again in the Ashes test match when he has such a lead that he could have forfeited an innings!"
Ben chimes in: "I didn't think Ponting would enforce the follow-on - he only used 4 bowlers in the 1st innings; if he had been thinking of bowling twice he would have probably got Symonds (& maybe Clarke) to bowl a few to keep the quicks fresher."
81.2;W;Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT that's spooned straight to Clarke at deep square leg, good-length ball, Mahela picks it off but it's straight to Clarke, who doesn't have to move at deep square leg.

 Innings Start
And there it comes. Ponting walks off and Australia have declared at 2 for 210. That means an overall lead of 506 with Sri Lanka needing to bat more than five sessions to save this Test. Join us in a bit for more
Alex pulls out the stats for Phil: "If we leave out Murali's stats against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh and Warnes against Zimbabwe, what happens? He has 457 wickets at 24.3 each and Warne has 639 wickets at 24.6 each. In 13 years since Warne's debut [and Murali's as well], Warne played 132 tests to Murali's 98. If we knock off 18 tests for Murali [v Bangladesh and Zimbabwe] and one for Warne, Murali averages 5.7 wickets per test while Warne average 4.8 per game."
Incidentally Murali ends the series with 4 for 400 and will now have to wait for the England series to break the record

12.2;?;Murali to Hayden, no run big shout there, topspinner that time, Hayden goes for the sweep, misses and that struck him pretty straight, probably doing too much and missing off, umpire Koertzen doesn't give it;

10.3;3;Murali to Jaques, 3 runs sharp offbreak, poked tentatively and that flies past the lone slip, why Mahela has just one slip in there (as he did in the first innings) is anyone's guess. Actually that was a chance, Mahela got his finger tips to it. Tough but a chance all the same;

 Innings Start
The players from both team shake hands. And Sangakkara is seen shaking hands with Rudi Koertzen who, I think, apologized about the decision. I could lipread, Sanga saying, "No Problem" as he patted Rudi on the back.
It was absolutely fabulicious knock from Sangakkara. A shame it had to end the way it did, but grab the dvd. There were some breathtaking shots, some improvised, some traditional and some out of this world. He moved outside leg, walked towards off, waltzed down the track and indulged himself in the middle.
Sri Lanka started the final day with hopes of staging a upset. 260 runs with 7 wickets in hand. They started off positively with Jayasuriya looking to attack but Lee drew a false stroke from him and that was the beginning of the end.
Sangakkara played a delicious knock, counterattacking in the end with some breathtaking shots, before the fatal finger of fate intervened. Malinga indulged in some hit and giggle before Australia wrapped up the series win.
Man of the Match and the Player of the series Brett Lee
"I am pretty pleased with the way the ball is coming out. Credit to all the bowlers. Sangakkara played a fantastic knock but we knew if we could get one wicket we could win the game."
Mahela Jayawardene Let me congratulate Ricky and his boys. They played great cricket .. they keep raising the bar. Congrats to Lee who showed how to bowl on these tracks." He then thanks his team-mates.
Ricky Ponting: It was a pleasure to play against you [Sri Lanka] guys. It was good to see some of the talent going around in Australia. The transition has been very very smooth and I look forward to playing with the boys." He then thanks the crowd.
That's it for now. I am Sriram Veera, signing off. Meanwhile, his team-mates join Ponting on the dias and they pose for photographs. Laughter all round. Their 14th Test win in a row. Thanks for logging on. On behalf of Sid V ... bye!
104.3;W;Lee to Murali, OUT It's all over. 14th consecutive Test win for Australia. Finally, some sense prevailed and Lee sent one full and straight.

104.1;?;Lee to Murali, no run Lee fires in a bouncer, following Murali who backs away but manages to steer it to point. Can we have a yorker on the stumps please?;

84.1;W;Clark to Fernando, 2 runs, OUT Would you believe it? Now there is a run out. SL are slipping rapidly out of the radar. The substitute Lockyear joins in the fun. Full pitched, on the middle and leg and driven through midwicket. Fernando turns for the third run, Lockyear swoops on the ball, swivels around and fires in a flat,fast and a accurate throw. Lee is waiting there, the ball is in his right hand and he breaks the stumps. Did he break the stumps with the left hand first? Or did he manage to do it correctly. Close. Perhaps it could have been refered upstairs. May be, the ump never had any doubt in first place.;Dilhara Fernando run out (sub [RJG Lockyear]/Lee) 2 (5m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 200;
83.6;4;MacGill to Sangakkara, FOUR runs Another full toss and its carted over midwicket. Sanga carries on. Lone man fighting.;
83.5;W;MacGill to Maharoof, OUT MacGill gets a wicket from a pretty short ball. It was short and spinning away from Maharoof who went for a pull shot from outside off that went horribly wrong for him. The ball ballooned behind mid-on where Lee backpedalled, to his right, then to his left as the ball swirled down and managed to hold it. SL have not managed to gatecrash into Australia's party. Not yet, at least.;Farveez Maharoof c Lee b MacGill 4 (31m 26b 0x4 0x6) SR: 15.38;

82.5;?;Clark to Maharoof, no run;

82.2;1;Clark to Maharoof, 1 run short in length, on the middle and leg, Maharoof pulls it away. He was troubled by the injury there. It didn't quite swivel properly but managed to make contact;

77.4;W;Johnson to HAPW, OUT Yesterday it was Lee. Today it is Johnson. Two in two and Jayawardene is out for a pair! It landed on a length, on the middle and off stump and straightened. Jayawardene shouldered arms but to his horror the ball shaped in to strike him on the pad. Hawk eye says it would have just clipped the off stump. Fatal decision to leave.;Prasanna Jayawardene lbw b Johnson 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
77.3;W;Johnson to Silva, OUT Australia needed seven wickets at the start of the day and here comes the second wicket .

75.6;?;Johnson to Silva, no run another one angling away but Silva covers the off stump with a lunge of his left leg and shoulders arms.;

It was a length delivery, in the zone outside off stump, Jayasuriya tries to cut it away but gets a bottom edge. Gone! Big wicket. Lee is the man for Australia. He went over the wickets and got his man. Good catch too. It was tailing away, low to his left but Gilchrist took a neat catch.;Sanath Jayasuriya c ?Gilchrist b Lee 45 (111m 77b 6x4 0x6) SR: 58.44;
74.2;?;Lee to Jayasuriya, no run on a length, around the off stump and it shapes away, Jayasuriya thinks about playing a shot before withdrawing his bat away. Any indecision, hesitation could be fatal here. What a game. Tense.;

72.1;?;Lee to Jayasuriya, no run beaten. Lovely delivery. It drifted in, full and outside off stump before it went away. Remember, Lee is bowling from round the stumps and Jayasuriya thought he can cream that through covers but was beaten by the away movement. Just one wide slip in place. Hmm..;

71.5;?;Johnson to Sangakkara, no run reverse swing there. Fuller, on the off stump, it tailed in late, Sanga arrested his front foot movement, got his bat around it and jabbed it away. Had he pushed his front foot a bit more across, he would have been in trouble.;

71.3;?;Johnson to Jayasuriya, no run keeps it in the same line - just outside off stump, Jayasuriya, again, plays away from the body, not quite leaning towards the line and the ball rolls away to the on side;
71.2;2;Johnson to Jayasuriya, 2 runs almost a fatal drag on. It was just outside off stump, off a length, Jayasuriya pushed at it, the bat came outside the line, the ball collided with the inside edge and it ran away past the leg stump.;

70.2;?;Lee to Jayasuriya, no run again, outside off stump and Jayasuriya lets it fly past him. Mahela thought he did a similar thing, only to see the off stump pegged back. So it would be interesting to see how long Jayasuriya will leave 'em.;

68.2;?;Lee to Sangakkara, no run left alone outside off, too wide that time;
68.1;?;Lee to Sangakkara, no run short on this time, tries to turn it to the leg side, leading edge nearly pops back to the bowler, could have been a wicket straight away;
67.6;1;Johnson to Sangakkara, 1 run;
67.6;1nb;Johnson to Sangakkara, (no ball) outside off, short of a length, dabbed away towards short third man, hesitation in the running now, direct hit from Hussey at the non-striker's end could have had Jayasuriya but he misses;
