Data
1.22pm So, Australia grind their way to a competitive 351, thanks to fifties from Smith and Warner, and a superb 96 from Mitch Marsh, aided and abetted by partnerships all down the order, particularly with Paine and Starc. Maharaj the pick of South Africa's bowlers, which will have Nathan Lyon licking his lips. But plenty encouragement for the likes of Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins too. It's on. Back in five for the resumption.
110.4;W;Maharaj to Lyon, OUT that's the way to do it. Lyon attempted another mow, this time down the ground, but a big miscue loops calmly into the covers, for Maharaj to claim a richly deserved five-wicket haul!;Nathan Lyon c de Bruyn b Maharaj 12 (39m 24b 2x4 0x6) SR: 50;

110.2;4;Maharaj to Lyon, FOUR runs that's a pleasing wallop from Lyon, down on one knee, scything a slog sweep clean across the line;
110.1;?;Maharaj to Lyon, no run round the wicket, looped onto the legs. Pushed to the on side;

109.2;W;Philander to Marsh, OUT goes for glory, and holes out to mid-on! Oh Mitch... a length delivery, his eyes lit up, a big heave through the line, but he found the tallest man on the field.

108.4;2;Maharaj to Lyon, 2 runs worked back down the pitch, into the gap at mid-on;
108.3;3;Maharaj to Marsh, 3 runs well bowled, but unlucky... tossed up, looping into the toes, and a nutmeg of an inside-edge flies through Marsh's legs down to fine leg, where Philander makes a meal of his boundary fielding, but just about saves the four. He's into the 90s...;

93.3;4;Morkel to Starc, FOUR runs length ball, Starc plays an expansive shot on the up, thick-edged past the closer catcher and Maharaj has to five chase from square leg, he then slips over as he approaches the boundary and can't stop the ball trundling for four;

74.5;?;Rabada to Paine, no run length ball in the channel, up above 140kph but Paine ushers it through;
74.4;4;Rabada to Paine, FOUR runs angled in but it's too straight, 137kph and flicked fine, the ball races away to the rope for four;

74.2;?;Rabada to Paine, no run comes across and works to the leg side;

73.3;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run this nips back a little, good line in the channel and Marsh chops down on it in defence;

72.6;?;de Bruyn to Paine, no run fuller length, tapped to cover;
72.5;1;de Bruyn to Marsh, 1 run short and innocuous. Marsh climbs into an eager pull but scuffs his shot to midwicket;

71.6;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run shoulders arms again to a fuller length outside off;
71.5;4;Morkel to Marsh, FOUR runs on the toes, that's an easy pick-up, over the leg side and away to the rope. Too full, and Marsh needed only to connect to score;
71.4;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run lovely lift from a good length, Marsh is tempted by the wider line but has to remove his bat from harm's way sharpish;

71.1;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run dabbed out to point, the lights are blinking into life now;
70.6;?;de Bruyn to Paine, no run through to the keeper with minimum fuss. A bit of an all-sorts over, nearly scrounging the breakthrough. But SA are one over closer to that new ball...;

70.4;?;de Bruyn to Paine, no run loopy full length, dipping under the eyeline and tapped back down the pitch;
70.3;?;de Bruyn to Paine, no run punched back down the pitch, to the bowler himself this time;
70.2;4;de Bruyn to Paine, FOUR runs another full toss, another near-miss! Dipping late, into the drive, and slapped airily, just out of the reach of short cover! Yikes;
70.1;?;de Bruyn to Paine, no run low full toss, wellied on the up ... inches short of mid-on! Good grief, that would have been a tame dismissal;
69.6;?;Morkel to Marsh, no run a yawning leave outside off stump;
69.5;1;Morkel to Paine, 1 run short, and another well-connected pull out to deep midwicket. Not over-hitting the stroke, just lining up the ball and placing it out into the deep;

Seb: "That last ball from Philander jumped off a decent length and even after nearly 65 overs he is finding seam movement. His height and seam position causing a big problem on this pitch. Could mean Hazelwood especially will enjoy this pitch when his turn comes." Indeed. Australia's attack have the tools to thrive here. Not least Lyon in the Maharaj role
 Innings Start
5.55pm: How's that for an eye-opener? Anyone in danger of nodding off towards the close will be sitting up straight now... That is stumps, a few minutes early, with SA forlornly sifting the wreckage. Four wickets fell in 14 balls there, as Mitchell Starc swung his tailender nervous-wrecking ball. In all, South Africa lost their last five for 12 runs in six-and-a-bit overs (and 7 for 70 from Faf du Plessis' dismissal), with AB de Villiers watching on at the other end. He perhaps didn't do as much as he could to shield the tail but, to be fair, his own contribution was on a completely different level to his team-mates. Only Aiden Markram joined him in passing 20, as South Africa were badgered relentlessly by this high-class Australia attack. Rememeber there was that ball change, too, after which Australia got it to reverse significantly. Anyway, Australia have secured a commanding 189-run lead and will be well placed to build on that tomorrow; Brydon's report will be updated shortly, and we've got a gallery and highlights (Indian subcontinent only) for you, too. We'll be back for more in the morning. Cheerio!
51.4;W;Starc to Morkel, OUT knocked 'im over! Full, fast and Morkel didn't have a hope, the ball clattering off stump via his pad! Starc screams in celebration, he wraps up a five-for with a final thunderbolt to roll South Africa over as the shadows lengthen;Morne Morkel b Starc 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
51.3;?;Starc to Morkel, no run length in the channel, zips through as Morkel pokes at it;
51.2;W;Starc to Rabada, OUT yoinks, that's stone cold! The reverse-swinging yorker crashes into Rabada's pad and, although he reviews, this is going to be curtains! Brutal delivery from Starc, not many No. 10s in the world will keep that out... So befuddled was Rabada that he must have thought he got some bat on it, but not a chance. Smashing into middle and leg;Kagiso Rabada lbw b Starc 3 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 60;
51.1;2;Starc to Rabada, 2 runs over the wicket to Rabada, pitched up in the channel and driven, timed nicely for a couple;
50.6;1;Hazlewood to Rabada, 1 run fired in full, Rabada clips it off his toes to midwicket and they scamper through - so he'll keep the strike. I can see this going wrong again;
50.5;?;Hazlewood to Rabada, no run full and angling across, Rabada has an airy swipe that fails to connect;
50.4;?;Hazlewood to Rabada, no run stays over the wicket, touch short outside off and jabbed down from the crease;
50.3;W;Hazlewood to Maharaj, OUT timbeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Hazlewood plucks out off stump! Australia are running amok, Maharaj completely kippered by a heat-seaking delivery that demolishes his resistance, big gap between bat and pad as he hung back tentatively. Not sure AB's trust was warranted;Keshav Maharaj b Hazlewood 0 (5m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
50.2;?;Hazlewood to Maharaj, no run length ball, rising up as Maharaj jumps into line and blocks;
50.1;1;Hazlewood to de Villiers, 1 run shortish and worked off the hip for one - no protecting the tail here;
49.6;?;Starc to Maharaj, no run oof, this zips through past the edge as he hangs back and wafts outside off;
49.5;?;Starc to Maharaj, no run goes for the stump-rattling reverse-swinger again, there's half an appeal as Maharaj blocks - think bat struck pad before intercepting the ball;
49.4;?;Starc to Maharaj, no run pitched up on off, bunted away;
49.3;W;Starc to Philander, OUT no doubt this time, that's a jaffa! Full and straight, demanding a stroke, then fishtailing away at the last moment to snick the edge with Philander off balance and groping for the ball! Fiendish, rapid and reversing - though Philander didn't help himself by trying to play through mid-on. Not dissimilar to the Vince ball from the Ashes, without the spectacular stump flattening (or the aid of a crack);Vernon Philander c ?Paine b Starc 8 (20m 19b 1x4 0x6) SR: 42.1;
49.2;?;Starc to Philander, no run in the channel, Philander props forward and is beaten... Hang on, Australia are reviewing? There was barely an appeal but Smith must think he heard something. Ultra Edge is equally baffled, though, nothing on the reading, so Australia will lose a review;
49.1;?;Starc to Philander, no run oof, Philander reaches for the drive, edged short of second slip! Was a skimmer, never quite carrying;
48.6;?;Hazlewood to de Villiers, no run full length in the channel, scoots through a touch low as de Villiers shoulders arms;
48.5;?;Hazlewood to de Villiers, no run tight on off stump, defended again;

48.2;?;Hazlewood to de Villiers, no run testing line, whirring back late in the channel, judged pretty well as he sticks out the front pad and watches it by;

47.1;?;Lyon to Philander, no run flighted, dipping around off stump, punched to mid-off;

45.2;?;Lyon to Philander, no run over the wicket, tossed up and blocked;
45.1;W;Lyon to de Kock, OUT and now Lyon strikes, straight through de Kock! SA nerves jangle as the sixth wicket falls - they need someone to stick around. Looked like de Kock should probably have got forward to that ball but it skidded on past the bat as he camped in the crease, before applying the fatal kiss to the top of off stump;Quinton de Kock b Lyon 20 (54m 33b 4x4 0x6) SR: 60.6;
44.6;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run good-length delivery, defended coming forwards on off;

42.6;2;Cummins to de Kock, 2 runs back of a length in the channel outside off, driven through cover point for a couple, nicely controlled;
42.5;1;Cummins to de Villiers, 1 run targeting the stumps, almost looked like it might sneak through to hit the pads before de Villiers flicked it away disdainfully to fine leg;

42.3;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run length delivery, met with a defiant straight blade;
42.2;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run gets across to defend on off;
42.1;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run yowch, the new (old) ball introduces itself to de Villiers via a rap on the gloves! Dug in short by Cummins and AB leaps to get on top of it, takes a whack on the top hand - but he's okay to continue;

40.4;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run comes across and taps the ball into the off side;

40.2;?;Cummins to de Villiers, no run over the wicket, pitched up and tickled towards mid-off half forward;

33.2;?;Starc to de Kock, no run full length;
33.1;W;Starc to de Bruyn, OUT driven and gone! De Bruyn is suckered by Starc's deadly angle, into the stumps, nipping away. Stuck on the crease, he tried to hit his way out of a hole, and succeeded only in a fat edge to Paine!;Theunis de Bruyn c ?Paine b Starc 6 (28m 15b 1x4 0x6) SR: 40;

31.2;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run outside off, and left alone;
31.1;?;Starc to de Villiers, no run round the wicket, such a nagging line and length, reversing back into the right hander with a constant threat of seam movement. Blocked this time;
30.6;?;Hazlewood to de Bruyn, no run tailing into the right hander, who stands tall to defend on the back foot;
30.5;?;Hazlewood to de Bruyn, no run sliding down the leg side. Hazlewood hasn't quite nailed that dogged line and length so far;
