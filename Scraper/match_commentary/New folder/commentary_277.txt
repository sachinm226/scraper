3.42pm Now is the time we see if South Africa bowlers can eke something out of this pitch. I think it is a good thing they have been dismissed because this innings was not going anywhere. You'd think if Australia can score 224 here, it will be very difficult to force a result because of the amount of time SA have taken to score 423. A memorable dig for Elgar, de Villiers, Duminy and Lyon nonetheless. Be back in 10
Ben: "On the SOS nickname - Stephen Silvagni, one of the greatest Australian football players from the 90s, was called SOS - Son of Serge, his father, who also played AFL."
"James, NO this kind of utilitarian thinking is alien to the true concept of DRS which players are ONLY supposed to use if they are spitting mad after a decision." Nahim, I am with you. DRS should be used by umpires, and only for howlers, and only for what has happened in real life - where the ball pitched, was there an edge, where did it hit the pad - and not what would have happened - would it have shaved the outside half or the inside half of the bail.
150.5;W;Clarke to Morkel, OUT and the innings ends in a run-out. This is played just wide of short midwicket, and Morkel is sent back. A good take by Haddin on the half-volley, and Morkel is short by a frame;Morne Morkel run out (Smith/?Haddin) 1 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
150.4;1;Clarke to Steyn, 1 run driven to long-off for one;

149.5;?;Lyon to Morkel, no run flighted on the pads, defended to leg;
149.4;W;Lyon to Duminy, OUT that's plumb. And a michelle for Lyon. Maybe not as plumb. Duminy reviews this. Actually, Duminy has got it wrong. He is indeed plumb. Tries the reverse sweep, and is beaten. The ball is pitched middle, straightens, and is going on to hit middle. The on-field decision stays. Duminy out after scoring a hundred scored at a strike rate of 53, which is an achievement on this pitch;Jean-Paul Duminy lbw b Lyon 123 (286m 231b 14x4 0x6) SR: 53.24;
149.3;1;Lyon to Steyn, 1 run flighted on middle and leg, pushed into the leg side for one;

147.6;W;Lyon to Parnell, OUT wicket with the last ball before tea. Lyon has four. This wicket, though, belongs to Haddin, who has taken a superb catch. This is a half-volley outside off, Parnell drives, gets a thick edge - half-volleys are difficult to collect even they come straight at you - but Haddin rises with it, follows it, and takes it smoothly;Wayne Parnell c ?Haddin b Lyon 10 (40m 37b 1x4 0x6) SR: 27.02;

143.3;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run huge shout for lbw as Duminy is beaten on the sweep, but he is clearly outside the line of off, which Haddin sees, and doesn't join Lyon in the apeal;

140.5;?;Warner to Parnell, no run left alone outside off;
140.4;?;Warner to Parnell, no run Haddin appeals as if sure there is an edge. I don't hear any, Dharmasena hasn't heard it, but Haddin is so sure he has reviewed it. Short of a length, angling across, Parnell punches, misses, but there is a small deviation as it passes the toe of the bat. Nothing on HotSpot, nothing on Snicko so the decision stays;

113.6;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run flighted outside off, defended off the front foot;
113.5;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run quicker still, and straighter too, defended to leg;
113.4;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run nice flatter offbreak, he is groping for it, but the ball hits the outside half and not the edge;

112.3;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run short, wide, but he doesn't go after it;

112.1;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run short of a length, outside off, punched to cover;
111.6;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run down the wicket, drives this back to him;
111.5;4;Lyon to de Villiers, FOUR runs swept from outside off, all along the ground and bisects the two men in the deep. That's hundred for him. It looked like he would get it from the moment he played his first ball yesterday. Raises his arms, hugs the non-striker, and accepts the applause from everybody;
111.4;?;Lyon to de Villiers, no run defended off the front foot;
111.3;1;Lyon to Duminy, 1 run turn from middle and off, but he has time to recover, and drop his hands. Gets a single past slip;
111.2;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run flighted outside off, defended;
111.1;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run nearly runs himself out. Bunted to leg, just behind square, so it is AB's call but Duminy doesn't respond. He makes it back in time, though;

109.1;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run on a length, holds its line in front of off, defended from the crease;
108.6;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run wide half-volley, lovely drive, but the fields are deep set, and cover-point fields this;

108.1;?;Harris to Duminy, no run short of a length, seams in, beats the inside edge, hits the thigh pad;
107.6;2;Lyon to de Villiers, 2 runs beautiful shot. Slow pitches make this a difficult shot to play, but he goes back and punches this one between cover and point without any trouble;
107.5;1;Lyon to Duminy, 1 run down the wicket, beaten in flight, squared up a touch, but the front edge avoids the diving short cover;
107.4;4;Lyon to Duminy, FOUR runs short, wide, and Duminy goes back cut it in front of square. Beats the man at cover to his left. He has had to wait for an age for this ball to arrive;

106.1;2;Harris to de Villiers, 2 runs length ball, angling in, runs off the inside half of the bat for a couple;
105.6;2;Lyon to Duminy, 2 runs swept from middle and leg. These usually go square but he has managed to send this one fine;
105.5;2;Lyon to Duminy, 2 runs nice turn from short of a length, but the pitch is so slow he has an age to make the adjustment, and ride it and guide it wide of slip;
105.4;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run short, wide, punched away, can't beat cover;
105.3;1;Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run short of a length, middle and leg, punched away to deep midwicket;

104.5;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run Harris creates a chance with this one seaming in, but it has taken the inside edge onto the pad;
104.4;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run bouncer, AB thinks of pulling it, but it is too far outside off to be dragging it;
104.3;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run on a length, on off, defended off the front foot;
104.2;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run left alone as this is widish outside off;
104.1;4;Harris to de Villiers, FOUR runs short, wide, and de Villiers cuts it off the front foot, designed to place it in front of square;

102.4;?;Siddle to de Villiers, no run full, on the pads, defended back to him;
102.3;4;Siddle to de Villiers, FOUR runs can't bowl that with a strong leg-side field. Not to ABD. Short of a length, on off, and he drives off the back foot, through the prone off-side field;

101.5;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run defended off the front foot;
101.4;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run edges this sweep, a healthy top edge, but he is lucky it hits the fleshy part of his shoulder and doesn't lob up;

101.2;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run shortish, wants to cut it, but can't beat point;
101.1;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run looks to sweep, doesn't get all of it, plays with soft hands;

"100 overs and no reviews? Says it all really" it does, JimDavis. Not even the drinks break is waking me up
Round the stumps goes Siddle
 Innings Start
1.51pm An aggressive and spirited reply from the South Africa bowlers. They have now got a 177-run lead, and now the question is, will South Africa have an eye on the forecast for Monday when they plan the tempo they go at? I remember I asked Alviro a similar question when they didn't quite look urgent with the bat in Durban. I asked him how much they look at weather. He said that unfortunately the forecast in South Africa is not usually that accurate. I'll be back shortly
56.6;W;Morkel to Harris, OUT Morkel finally gets his man. Floats this up and wide, Harris goes for the drive, and gets a thick flying edge to second slip. Harris and Siddle rush off the field because they have bowl in 10 minutes;Ryan Harris c du Plessis b Morkel 26 (40m 26b 4x4 1x6) SR: 100;
56.5;4;Morkel to Harris, FOUR runs on a length, into the pads, and Harris smacks another boundary. Another brave little stand. Goes up to 37;
56.4;?;Morkel to Harris, no run another bouncer, widish, left alone again;
56.3;?;Morkel to Harris, no run bouncer, 147ks, Harris ducks under it;
56.2;3;Morkel to Siddle, 3 runs shot. Siddle gets it in his swinging zone, and chips it through the vacant mid-on region;
56.1;1;Morkel to Harris, 1 run on a length from over the stumps, pushed to mid-off for a single;
55.6;1;Steyn to Harris, 1 run swinging in again but too straight, and concedes a leg-bye;
55.5;?;Steyn to Harris, no run this is reversing for sure. Moves in from outside off again, and beats the inside edge on the drive;
55.4;1;Steyn to Siddle, 1 run short of a length, worked to leg. Siddle wants a second, is sent back, and the throw is at the wrong end;
55.3;?;Steyn to Siddle, no run how did that miss? This one nips back and stays low from just outside off, beats the inside edge, and would have taken it had there been two more stumps;
55.2;1lb;Steyn to Harris, 1 leg bye this one tails back in, beats the inside edge, goes for a leg-bye;
55.1;?;Steyn to Harris, no run on a length, on off, Harris stays back and defends;
54.6;4;Morkel to Siddle, FOUR runs full again but this is too straight, and has been clipped away for a four to long leg;
54.5;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run pitched up outside off, Siddle throws his bat at it, and is beaten;
54.4;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run bowls one rising into the chest, Siddle fends it down;
54.3;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run good bouncer, on off, higher than the shoulder, at 141ks, beats Siddle's pull;
54.3;2w;Morkel to Harris, 2 wide this has slipped out of the hand. Big wide and a full toss down the leg side. Well done, AB, with that dive to save three runs;
54.2;?;Morkel to Harris, no run Harris backs away and pulls, but misses the line entirely. This is entertaining;
54.1;1;Morkel to Siddle, 1 run short of a length, tucked away off the hip for a single;
53.6;?;Philander to Harris, no run defended from the crease as Philander has learned his lesson and pitched this on a length;
53.5;?;Philander to Harris, no run straight, on a length, defended to mid-on;
53.4;?;Philander to Harris, no run another bouncer, but this is quite high, and he has ducked under it;
53.3;4;Philander to Harris, FOUR runs tries the drive, the ball skids through takes the toe end, and goes between slip and gully for four;
53.2;6;Philander to Harris, SIX runs what a shot. philander should not be banging it in short to Harris, who has dismissed this from his presence. Over midwicket. Follow-on avoided with that shot;
53.1;?;Philander to Harris, no run on a length, around off, holds its line, defended to mid-on;
52.6;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run one bounce to short leg. Rising into the ribs again, but kept down with the fend;
52.5;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run another appeal down leg. This time they have listened to Robbie P and reviewed it. This is uncomfortable down leg, and they are appealing for the catch. Illingworth is superb again, but South Africa listen to the substitute and the review it. No touch on it. Nowhere near edging it;
52.4;1;Morkel to Harris, 1 run tries the pitched-up delivery for a change, concedes the single past over;
52.3;?;Morkel to Harris, no run bouncer, at the stumps, a touch down leg possibly, and has been left alone;
52.2;1;Morkel to Siddle, 1 run short of a length, about rib high, drops it to leg, and goes to the other end;
52.1;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run bouncer, but a bit too far outside off, and easy to negotiate;
51.6;?;Philander to Harris, no run cracking shot, but finds point with it. Don't know why Philander is bowling short;
51.5;4;Philander to Harris, FOUR runs this is short, and at Philander's on this pitch this a freebie. Harris pulls it in front of square for four;
51.4;1;Philander to Siddle, 1 run short, looks to pull, mistimes;
51.3;?;Philander to Siddle, no run short of a length, stays back and defends;
51.2;1;Philander to Harris, 1 run on a length, pushed to cover for a single;
51.1;?;Philander to Harris, no run gets some seam in from a length, hits the toe end of the bat;
50.6;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run another bouncer to end the over, he drops his wrists and gets out of its line;
50.5;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run tries to pull this one, but this skids on, and beats him and hits him just over the box;
50.5;1nb;Morkel to Siddle, (no ball) no-ball this time. He is posing grave physical danger to these armoured batsmen;
50.4;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run fends this one in front of his chest. Keeps it down;
50.3;?;Morkel to Siddle, no run and there is one first up. Nasty one too. Stays low, and hits him on the forearm. Oh actually it has hit the glove, and Morkel has no support in the appeal. Steyn wanted this reviewed, but no one listens to him;
50.2;W;Morkel to Smith, OUT it's a beaut from Morne, and South Africa have reviewed it. AB and Smith celebrate immediately, but Morne joins in pretty late. Smith doesn't consult anybody, and goes up straight. He is pretty sure there is an edge. This is on a length, outside off, holds its line, Smith drives, and I think there is a feather on the bat and a noise too, but the HotSpot doesn't register it. And only a slight spike on the snicko. Has Aleem seen enough to overturn this one? Yes, he has. He has given him. Disbelieving looks in the Australian balcony. A shake of the head from Steve Smith too;Steven Smith c ?de Villiers b Morkel 49 (102m 72b 8x4 0x6) SR: 68.05;
50.1;?;Morkel to Smith, no run bowls on a length, 140ks, defended from the crease;
49.6;?;Duminy to Harris, no run full and straight, driven back to him;
49.5;?;Duminy to Harris, no run on a length, stays around middle and leg, defended;
49.4;?;Duminy to Harris, no run flighted on middle and leg, defended back to him;
49.3;4;Duminy to Harris, FOUR runs starts with a long hop, Harris gets four free runs. Batting seems easy at such times;
49.2;W;Duminy to Johnson, OUT Duminy gets a wicket too. JP jou lekker ding. Follows up the century with a bonus wicket. Johnson plays for the turn, but he has hardly turned a door knob today. It pitches off, goes on with the arm, beats the inside edge, and knocks off the off peg;Mitchell Johnson b Duminy 27 (39m 23b 3x4 1x6) SR: 117.39;
49.1;1;Duminy to Smith, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, worked away for one;
48.6;1;Morkel to Smith, 1 run a slightly spongy bouncer, pulled to deep midwicket for one;
48.5;?;Morkel to Smith, no run defended off the back foot again;
48.4;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length, angling across him, defended by Smith;
48.3;1;Morkel to Johnson, 1 run this bouncer doesn't quite get up, he gets in line, and pulls it to fine leg for one;
48.2;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run this is nastier. Morne paying Mitch in the same currency. He has hit the helmet this time. That helmet rebounds on his head. That's a mean nasty hostile bouncer. To make it worse they appeal for a catch, and give him more anxious moments. This has hit him between the emu and the kangaroo. A new helmet is on its way, this is sensational bowling;
48.1;?;Morkel to Johnson, no run he has hit him on the glove and then in the rib. Why so late from South Africa. Dug in. Angled into the ribs. He fends with eyes off. That's nasty;
47.6;?;Duminy to Smith, no run flighted on middle and leg, defended right back;
47.5;?;Duminy to Smith, no run flighted on off, he is right forward in defence;
47.4;?;Duminy to Smith, no run quick, flat, defended back to him;
47.3;?;Duminy to Smith, no run full, on off, defended back to him;
47.2;?;Duminy to Smith, no run on a length, a bit of a toppie, defended from the crease;
47.1;3;Duminy to Johnson, 3 runs flighted outside off, Johnson drives hard, gets a thick edge, and there is no short third man to save these runs;
46.6;?;Morkel to Smith, no run length ball, but wide outside off, 143ks, left alone;
46.5;?;Morkel to Smith, no run another leave outside off. Morkel's least threatening over so far;
46.4;?;Morkel to Smith, no run length ball, but Morne's length ball rises quite high, and can be left alone on bounce. Smith does just that;
46.3;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length, outside off, defended solidly;
46.2;4;Morkel to Smith, FOUR runs Smith follows a shortish delivery, and splits the slips with an educated edge. The toe end as this keeps low, and goes between the first slip and the wide slip;
46.1;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
45.6;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run slightly shorter, and defended this time;
45.5;6;Duminy to Johnson, SIX runs Johnson goes one better. He is a clean hitter, is Johnson. A half-volley on the pads, and he drives it over mid-on this time. This is stylish;
45.4;4;Duminy to Johnson, FOUR runs lovely drive from Johnson. Nearly takes out the non-striker with it. There is a shout of catch it, but only Smith (Steve) could have caught this, and he is busy getting out of the way;
45.3;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run short, slides in as opposed to turning away, defended back to him;
45.2;1;Duminy to Smith, 1 run worked around the corner for a single;
45.1;?;Duminy to Smith, no run on a length, angled across him from round the stumps. Defended;
44.6;4;Steyn to Johnson, FOUR runs half-volley, wide, and Johnson loves him a drive. This is stylishly done too,past the diving man at cover;
44.5;1;Steyn to Smith, 1 run short of a length, outside off, punched past cover for one;
44.4;?;Steyn to Smith, no run this one reverses in after pitching, that is quite late, and Smith has to act fat to keep this out;
44.3;1;Steyn to Johnson, 1 run short of a length, angling in, deflected away to fine leg;
44.2;2;Steyn to Johnson, 2 runs hard hands from Johnson, gets a thick edge, past gully for two;
44.1;1;Steyn to Smith, 1 run full, into the pads, clipped away for one;
43.6;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run full, nearly a yorker, dug out by Johnson;
43.5;4;Duminy to Johnson, FOUR runs half-volley, and Mitch can drive, as he does this past cover for four;
43.4;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run flighted outside off, driven to short cover;
43.3;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run flighted, straight, driven back at him;
43.2;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run floated outside off, left alone;
43.1;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run this one doesn't turn after pitching around off. Johnson does well to recover and defend;
42.6;?;Steyn to Smith, no run on a length, outside off, he leans forward in defence;
42.5;?;Steyn to Smith, no run shortish, stays low, Smith does well to keep it out;
42.4;?;Steyn to Smith, no run full, swinging in towards off, Smith if forward, plays it late, defends;
42.3;?;Steyn to Smith, no run swinging in, defended in front of middle and leg;
42.2;?;Steyn to Smith, no run short of a length, just outside off, defended from the crease;
42.1;?;Steyn to Smith, no run full, on off, tailing in, hits the outside half of the bat;
41.6;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run full and fast, driven back to him;
41.5;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run on a length, outside off, driven to short cover;
41.4;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run defended to leg;
41.3;?;Duminy to Johnson, no run is looking more and more like Harbahajan, is Duminy. Clipped away off the pad;
41.2;1;Duminy to Smith, 1 run tucked around the corner for one;
41.1;?;Duminy to Smith, no run on a length, outside off, defended;
40.6;2;Steyn to Johnson, 2 runs angling in, quick, from round the stumps, squares him up, goes off the thick outside edge;
40.5;W;Steyn to Haddin, OUT the middle stumps is flat. Steyn is pumped up. This is his first wicket, but what a beauty it is. Late inswing, Haddin plays an expansive drive, misreads the length as this is not quite a half-volley. The ball has time to move in, beats the drive, and crashes into the middle stump. What were you saying, Jean?;Brad Haddin b Steyn 9 (54m 25b 1x4 0x6) SR: 36;
40.4;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run swinging in... definite reverse, but this is a nice little half-volley, which Haddin has driven to mid-off;
40.3;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run on a length, outside off, left alone;
40.2;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run on a length outside off, tailing back in, driven on the up, but straight to mid-off;
40.1;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run huge huge appeal from Steyn as this reverse-swings to beat the inside edge. Pitched off, sliding down too far. Easy decision for the umpire;
39.6;?;Elgar to Smith, no run forward-defensive to end this split over;
39.5;1;Elgar to Haddin, 1 run full, on the pads, pushed to long-on for one;
39.4;?;Elgar to Haddin, no run nice dip for Elgar's slow left-arm, defended back to him;
39.3;?;Parnell to Haddin, no run defended to cover;
39.2;2;Parnell to Haddin, 2 runs short of a length, on the pads, goes for leg-byes. Haddin takes Steyn on, who is running in from fine leg. Haddin is relaxed because there is nobody at the stumps to collect the throw, so he assumes they might be going at the other end. However, Steyn goes for the direct hit at Haddin's end, and misses by inches. haddin was gone had it hit;
39.1;?;Parnell to Haddin, no run quick length ball, 143ks, pitches middle and off, defended in front of off. Nearly squared up;
38.6;4;Steyn to Smith, FOUR runs slight hint of swing back in, but Smith is an attacking mode, and makes him pay for straying in line. Takes this from middle and leg, and flicks it past mid-on;
38.5;?;Steyn to Smith, no run left alone outside off;
38.4;?;Steyn to Smith, no run driven to cover;
38.3;?;Steyn to Smith, no run stays on a length, around off, defended;
38.2;4;Steyn to Smith, FOUR runs runs continue to flow. Smith pushes at one length ball outside off, the ball holds its line, takes the edge, and goes wide of the second slip;
38.1;?;Steyn to Smith, no run length ball outside off, left alone;
37.6;1;Parnell to Smith, 1 run driven on the up, wide of mid-off, gets a single;
37.5;?;Parnell to Smith, no run on a length, on off, angling away, left alone;
37.4;1;Parnell to Haddin, 1 run the stylish square drive from Haddin, but Duminy saves three runs with a big dive at point. The ball had almost past him when he got a hand to it;
37.3;1;Parnell to Smith, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, worked away for one;
37.2;?;Parnell to Smith, no run length ball outside off, quite slippery at 141ks, left alone;
37.1;4;Parnell to Smith, FOUR runs Smith continues to rub it in. Flicks away a length ball from the pads, beats mid-on with ease;
36.6;1;Steyn to Smith, 1 run on a length, into the pads, worked away for one to deep square;
36.5;?;Steyn to Smith, no run driven hard to mid-off. Steyn is furious. Those crazy eyes can be seen;
36.4;?;Steyn to Smith, no run pushed to cover;
36.3;?;Steyn to Smith, no run Amla dropped one catch. Now his substitute Robbie P has dropped one. This must be heartbreaking for the bowlers. This is on a length, into the pads, tailing in, Smith fails to keep the flick down, but RP drops a dolly at square leg. Smith throws his head back and thanks the man upstairs. Both the batsmen have had lives;
36.2;?;Steyn to Smith, no run wide length ball, Smith moves into the drive, but finds cover with it;
36.1;?;Steyn to Smith, no run this is tailing in. Could be reverse. flicked to square leg;
35.6;3;Parnell to Smith, 3 runs short of a length, on the pads, Smith gets inside the line, and he places it past square leg. De Kock is slow in the chase again because he wearing those shin pads you do when fielding at short leg;
35.5;?;Parnell to Smith, no run another leave outside off as this one angles away;
35.4;?;Parnell to Smith, no run wide length ball, angling away, 141ks, left alone;
35.3;?;Parnell to Smith, no run short of a length, just outside off, no movement, defended back to him;
35.2;?;Parnell to Smith, no run on a length, just outside off, allowed to angle through to AB;
35.1;?;Parnell to Smith, no run short of a length, on the pads, defended;

34.5;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run on a length, into the pads, defended to leg;
34.4;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run angling in, defended to leg;
34.3;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run in followed by out. This one moves away from a similar length and line, and this beats the outside edge. Great start by Steyn;
34.2;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run Steyn bowls at a length, just outside off, seams in, Haddin is hanging back, gets an inside edge onto the pad;
34.1;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run length ball, middle and leg, defended;
33.6;4;Philander to Smith, 4 runs on the pads, a soft delivery, and he flicks it past midwicket. De Kock gives chase, realises late that the ball is pulling up, and saves one run with a final dive. Hang on. He hasn't saved anything. They ran four;
33.5;4;Philander to Smith, FOUR runs lovely drive by Smith. He is still positive despite all the attacking bowling from Morkel. On a length, widish, and he leans into the drive, and beats short cover to get four more;
33.4;?;Philander to Smith, no run on a length, just outside off, defended off the front foot;
33.3;?;Philander to Smith, no run short of a length, at the stumps, defended to leg;
33.2;?;Philander to Smith, no run another front-foot defensive from Smith as Philander pitches on a length just outside off;
33.1;?;Philander to Smith, no run Philander continues to nag away around off, and defended off the front foot;
32.6;?;Morkel to Haddin, no run this is a serious spell. A bouncer now at 147ks. Haddin has to take quick evasive action and get out of its line. Sensational bowling from Morkel. Where was this Morne in Centurion?;
32.5;1;Morkel to Smith, 1 run awkward again, angled into the ribs at 151ks. Smith just about manages to keep it out, and gets a single to fine leg;
32.4;?;Morkel to Smith, no run bouncer at 146ks, just outside off, and it has risen head high. Smith pulls out of the pull;
32.3;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short at 148ks, Smith wants to pull, but it is more ball hitting the bat and going down than Smith pulling it. This has jammed his gloves against the handle;
32.2;?;Morkel to Smith, no run and he nearly has Smith like he should have had Lyon yesterday. Smith is hopping, getting inside the line, hangs his bat out for one outside leg, but fails to edge it;
32.1;?;Morkel to Smith, no run and he bowls a quick short ball, and Smith is beaten for pace on the pull;
31.6;?;Philander to Haddin, no run punched straight to point;
31.5;4;Philander to Haddin, FOUR runs dropped. Well I am being a little harsh in calling this a chance. Amla it is. Short of a length, outside off, Haddin punches, gets a thick edge, high and slightly to Amla's left at gully. We have to remember they are standing pretty close to the batsmen because of the usual low bounce here. And Amla just gets a finger to it, which has now split open, sending him off the field for repairs;
31.4;?;Philander to Haddin, no run slightly fuller, just outside off, Haddin has to be watchful in defence;
31.3;?;Philander to Haddin, no run another edge doesn't carry. Short of a length, outside off, seams away, in that it holds its line. Haddin follows with his hands, gets the edge, but it falls well short of second slip;
31.2;?;Philander to Haddin, no run on a length, on off, pretty accurate, defended back;
31.1;?;Philander to Haddin, no run on a length, outside off, defended to cover;
30.6;4;Morkel to Smith, FOUR runs a touch too full, a touch to straight, Smith stands tall and flicks this in front of square leg for four. Smith is counterattacking here;
30.5;?;Morkel to Smith, no run wide length ball, left alone, thuds into AB's gloves. Bowled at 148ks;
30.4;?;Morkel to Smith, no run on a length, angling in, 146ks, defended to leg;
30.3;?;Morkel to Smith, no run full, on off, 147ks, defended back to him;
30.2;1;Morkel to Haddin, 1 run Haddin off the mark right away as he jumps up to ride this and bunt it into the covers for one;
30.1;W;Morkel to Lyon, OUT and Morkel finally gets a wicket. he could have had five by now. Goes round the stumps and bowls fast and short. Too much for Lyon to handle. He backs away to see if he can make room and do something with this. He is cramped up, and ends up playing this onto the stumps;Nathan Lyon b Morkel 15 (61m 43b 2x4 0x6) SR: 34.88;
29.6;4;Philander to Smith, FOUR runs four more. Philander is bowling too straight. This is fuller, but still on the pads, and deftly deflected to fine leg;
29.5;4;Philander to Smith, FOUR runs too straight, shortish, on the pads, and Smith glances this fine for four;
29.4;?;Philander to Smith, no run short of a length, on off, right behind it;
29.3;W;Philander to Warner, OUT and Philander hasn't gone missing on this flat pitch. He has his accuser here, and doesn't even react or give a send-off to Warner. Just coolly walks off towards his team-mates. And Warner, he has died by the sword he has lived by. Gets a wide length ball and drives, as he has been doing. This time, though, he gets a healthy edge to first slip to end the feline innings. The Easterly at it, with a bit of subtle movement here and there AB was the first one to go Philander, having dropped Warner last night;David Warner c Smith b Philander 70 (146m 78b 10x4 0x6) SR: 89.74;
29.2;?;Philander to Warner, no run on a length, on off, holds its line, defended back. A lot of lip around. They are really getting stuck into Warner, who usually has a lot to say himself;
29.1;?;Philander to Warner, no run wide length ball, left alone;
28.6;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run another short one, Lyon tries to get inside the line and ramp this over that gully, but is beaten by pace. A word being said by Morkel. Lyon responds with a smile. This is a brave little cameo from Nathan;
28.5;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run tries the full one, but it is too far down leg;
28.4;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run and now at 144ks, he has been hit on the thigh pad. Warner calls him through for a chat, pats him on the back;
28.3;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run that's a quick short delivery, at 148ks, Lyon has no clue where it has gone. It has gone between past his inside edge, flicking his trousers on the way to AB, drawing an appeal for Morne;
28.2;1;Morkel to Warner, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, 138ks, gives him the time to go back and work this to leg for one;
28.1;?;Morkel to Warner, no run pitched up, 144ks, driven nicely, but straight to mid-off. Warner is quite positive;
27.6;?;Philander to Lyon, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone through to AB;
27.5;?;Philander to Lyon, no run Lyon gets adventurous and draws a big lbw appeal. Looks to whip this length ball to leg, but is beaten. The ball, though, is headed down;
27.4;?;Philander to Lyon, no run short of a length, wide, no bounce for Philander, pushed to point;
27.3;?;Philander to Lyon, no run fuller now, Lyon drives but not powerfully, and silly mid-off fields;
27.2;?;Philander to Lyon, no run defends this solidly right back to him;
27.1;2;Philander to Lyon, 2 runs length ball, on the pads, nicely clipped away past short midwicket for two;
26.6;1;Morkel to Lyon, 1 run this one doesn't get too high, and is punched away for a single past cover;
26.5;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run short again, but this is not accurate, and Lyon pushes at it. Duminy, though, fields with a dive at gully. Very short gully;
26.4;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run this is mean. Rising into the chest, Lyon fends, and is hit on the glove and then shoulder. He will be worried about that bowling hand too;
26.3;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run right behind this short delivery, bowled at 146ks, and keeps it down;
26.2;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run shorter from Morkel, 143ks, just outside off, Lyon drops his wrists out of the way and lets it sail through;
26.1;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run and he begins with a forward defence to a shortish delivery, that too from Morne Morkel;

25.4;?;Philander to Warner, no run on a length, outside off, driven on the up, but straight to mid-off;

25.1;2;Philander to Warner, 2 runs short of a length, on the stumps, runs off the outside half of the bat for runs;
24.6;?;Parnell to Lyon, no run and Lyon ends the day by riding the bounce, and saving the specialist batsmen;
24.5;?;Parnell to Lyon, no run has no clue about this headed towards the ribs, but somehow keeps it down. Warner offers to take the single and save any risk of injury to Lyon, but he turns it down. Brave fella;
24.4;?;Parnell to Lyon, no run and Lyon has the luck of Warner here. Short of a length,into the ribs, draws a thick edge, and Duminy drops it diving to his right at gully;
24.3;1;Parnell to Warner, 1 run a full bunger this time, and he gets a single to mid-on. Over to Nathan;
24.2;4;Parnell to Warner, FOUR runs short, wide, and doesn't matter what over it is, Warner goes after it, and gets four with the cut;
24.1;?;Parnell to Warner, no run;
23.6;?;Steyn to Lyon, no run angled across him, beats the outside edge;
23.5;?;Steyn to Lyon, no run and just as I say it, I think he is out. Short, down leg, and Lyon plays away from the body. I hear a noise as it goes past the bat, and there is nothing else but the bat close to the ball. The umpire, though, hasn't heard it. Lyon is not one to walk. SA don't review it. I can't believe it. They are playing DRS on the quality of the batsman, not the merit of the appeal. They wasted one for a specialist batsman when they knew it was a marginal call. Here they were almost sure this was out. but they don't. And Smith has been signalled immediately that it was out. He is angry;
23.4;?;Steyn to Lyon, no run again into the hips, Lyon is on top of the bounce as he fends. A brave little effort here. if Smith or Haddin scores a hundred tomorrow, he will owe it to Nathan;
23.3;?;Steyn to Lyon, no run and this is an angry bouncer after that boundary, but Lyon is expecting it, and gets under it;
23.2;4;Steyn to Lyon, FOUR runs and this is not good bowling if you have a silly point in. Pitches it up, and Lyon drives it into the man, who gets out of the way and lets it go for four;
23.1;1;Steyn to Warner, 1 run angles a length ball into the pads, which goes uppishly but safely through midwicket;
22.6;?;Parnell to Lyon, no run and the ball is dug in short, rising towards the chest. Lyon fends, but it falls short of short leg;
22.5;?;Parnell to Lyon, no run dug in short, rising towards the chest, Lyon rides it, keeps it down;
22.4;?;Parnell to Lyon, no run down the leg side with this shortish delivery, Lyon misses out on a little glance for four;
22.3;?;Parnell to Lyon, no run short of a length, on off, Lyon is in the air as he defends;
22.2;?;Parnell to Lyon, no run short of a length again, Lyon gets right behind it and defends;
22.1;?;Parnell to Lyon, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the back foot;
21.6;?;Steyn to Warner, no run short of a length, he pulls it, nay smacks it, but Duminy saves four at square leg with a dive;
21.5;?;Steyn to Warner, no run on a length, on off, defended from the crease;
21.4;2;Steyn to Warner, 2 runs and now we have a deep cover for Warner, who still manages to place this in front of him for a couple;
21.3;1;Steyn to Lyon, 1 run short of a length, just outside off, dropped into covers for one;
21.2;1;Steyn to Warner, 1 run on a length, on the pads, worked away;
21.1;4;Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs Warner is on fire too. Short of a length, widish. He just stands tall, and dispatches this loosener with contempt;
20.6;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run and Morkel still doesn't get it. This bouncer is aimed at Lyon's face. Too big for him as he fends and gets a leading edge, but it again falls short of gully;
20.5;4;Morkel to Lyon, FOUR runs into the ribs, Lyon does well this time, getting inside the line, riding the bounce, guiding it to fine leg for four;
20.4;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run short, but down leg, so a soft delivery finally for Lyon;
20.3;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run one of these days Morkel will bowl much worse and take a five-for. Short of a length, angling towards off, Lyon is backing away, but fails to edge it as he fends;
20.2;1;Morkel to Warner, 1 run on a length, on the pads, worked away. No shielding Lyon from Morkel as they take the single;
20.1;?;Morkel to Warner, no run on a length, on off, defended to cover;
19.6;1lb;Philander to Warner, 1 leg bye on the pads, misses, gets a leg-bye. Keeps Lyon away from Morkel;
19.5;2;Philander to Warner, 2 runs that's fifty for Warner as he works this off the pads for a couple wide of midwicket. He has had his luck, but he can make them pay for it;
19.4;?;Philander to Warner, no run on a length, on off, holds its line, and defends this back;
19.3;1;Philander to Lyon, 1 run short of a length, into the ribs, kept down for a single;
19.2;1;Philander to Warner, 1 run tucked away off the hip for a single;
19.1;?;Philander to Warner, no run this is down leg, easy to leave alone;
18.6;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run and one more. Lyon is being made to wear few. This is short too, he has no clue about it, and is hit on the glove. Concerned faces in the Australian dressing room. Chirping on the field. I can assure you I haven't heard anything said about broken arms. How the series has turned. Great Test cricket from South Africa;
18.5;?;Morkel to Lyon, no run oh Mean Morne. The crowd is loving this. Bouncer from round the stumps, flush into the helmet. Can't expect Lyon to be negotiating these. The fielders are all all over him;
18.4;1;Morkel to Warner, 1 run this is rising into the ribs, but Warner plays it down well to long leg;
18.3;?;Morkel to Warner, no run what does he need to do to get a wicket? Has him driving, beats him with the extra bounce from a length, but doesn't get the edge;
18.2;?;Morkel to Warner, no run Oh Morne Morkel. How many ladders has he walked under. Gets the bottom edge this time with a short ball, but it clips the back leg on the way through, making sure it doesn't carry. AB puts in a sensational dive, but gets it on a half-volley.Good on him to not go up for it. I know many people who would have;
18.1;?;Morkel to Warner, no run short of a length, outside off, defended to mid-off;
17.6;2;Philander to Lyon, 2 runs on a length, middle and leg, guided past mid-on for a couple;
17.5;?;Philander to Lyon, no run full, on off, driven back at Philander;
17.4;?;Philander to Lyon, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
17.3;?;Philander to Lyon, no run length ball, outside off, defended off the front foot;
17.2;W;Philander to Clarke, OUT never mind the slowness. It has got South Africa huge wicket. This is a length ball, bowled at 130ks, Clarke is used to facing the quickness of the previous two quicks, and ends up driving in front of his body. Ends up lobbing this to short cover. I am going to give a healthy share of the credit for this wicket to Morne and Parnell who have made sure Clarke hasn't moved sufficiently forward;Michael Clarke c Elgar b Philander 19 (39m 28b 4x4 0x6) SR: 67.85;
17.1;?;Philander to Clarke, no run on a length, significantly slower than the previous spell, at 130ks. Defended back to him;
16.6;?;Morkel to Warner, no run moves forward to defend this length ball;
16.5;?;Morkel to Warner, no run defended off the back foot;
16.4;4;Morkel to Warner, FOUR runs and Warner rubs the salt in. Crunches this shortish delivery in front of square for four. I can hear a loud grunt. One of an angry man. I can imagine it is Morne;
16.3;?;Morkel to Warner, no run dropped it. Warner has all the luck here. And would you believe, AB has dropped him? This is a cracker of a delivery first up. This has flown after hitting short of a length, taken the shoulde rof the bat, and AB - he is standing much closer here because of the slowness of the pitch - is a touch hurried with his footwork and everything. Gone down. Smith has a grab at the rebound, but can't get there;
16.2;?;Morkel to Warner, no run short of a length, 145ks, pushed towards mid-off;
16.1;1;Morkel to Clarke, 1 run more pace, into the ribs again, at 151.3ks. Clarke manages to fend it down again. It has actually hit the glove, the bottom hand. Lucky it hasn't lobbed up;
15.6;?;Parnell to Warner, no run on a length, just outside off, defended solidly off the front foot;
15.5;1;Parnell to Clarke, 1 run dug in shirt, into the ribs, Clarke fends it with the bottom hand off. Manages to keep it down;
15.4;1;Parnell to Warner, 1 run on a length, angling in, pushed towards mid-on for one. Soft hands, hard running;
15.3;?;Parnell to Warner, no run short of a length, outside off, defended off the back foot;
15.2;?;Parnell to Warner, no run length ball, outside off, this one comes on slower than usual, and takes the inside edge onto the pad;
15.1;4;Parnell to Warner, FOUR runs short, wide, this time Warne goes after it with all his might and gets four for it;
14.6;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run lovely bouncer, at 147ks, rising towards the head, and hasn't Clarke played it well. The wrists are dropped, he doesn't even duck properly, just gets his head out of its line;
14.5;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run short, rising at 145ks, outside off, and Clarke doesn't need to play at it;
14.4;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run short of a length, outside off, he rises with it, and defends the 148ks delivery;
14.3;4;Morkel to Clarke, FOUR runs this is as if Clarke is expecting a bouncer. Or he has seen this very early and has gone back pulled this through midwicket for four. Taken it from outside off too;
14.2;1lb;Morkel to Warner, 1 leg bye makes him hop a little as this is short and into the hip. Warner fends and there is no short leg;
14.1;4;Morkel to Warner, FOUR runs risky but effective drive. On the up, away from the body, but his hands take control of the drive as it goes along the ground and to the right of the diving short cover;
13.6;?;Parnell to Clarke, no run short of a length, outside off, Clarke is on hos toes as he punches this to mid-off;
13.5;?;Parnell to Clarke, no run slightly shorter, but Clarke is forward in defence outside off;
13.4;4;Parnell to Clarke, FOUR runs that's a Clarke special. This time the weight comes forward, drives this slightly on the up, but he is close to its line, and drives this past cover;
13.3;?;Parnell to Clarke, no run fuller, but still not a half-volley. Clarke is caught deep as he defends. Gets an inside edge onto the pad;
13.2;?;Parnell to Clarke, no run short of a length, quite quick too, at 148ks, defended from the crease;
13.1;3;Parnell to Warner, 3 runs full, middle and off, a half-volley really, Warner whips this across the line, past midwicket;
12.6;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run short of a length, on off, defended from the crease;
12.5;1;Morkel to Warner, 1 run pushes this fullish ball to mid-off, who is a bit deep, and runs off for a single;
12.4;?;Morkel to Warner, no run oh boy. This pitch is not slow for Morne. A bouncer at 148.2ks. Warner has ducked under it, but the ground is abuzz. A lot of applause from the cordon. Smith is applauding loudly;
12.3;?;Morkel to Warner, no run Oh Warner. Throws his hands at this wide short delivery, and is beaten. Nowhere near it;
12.2;1;Morkel to Clarke, 1 run Clarke has been missed. He has taken a really risky single after fending this towards cover. He is struggling, but Duminy's throw misses by inches;
12.1;1;Morkel to Warner, 1 run length ball, on the pads, pushed wide of mid-on for one;
11.6;?;Parnell to Clarke, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the back foot;
11.5;?;Parnell to Clarke, no run defends this one off the front foot;
11.4;?;Parnell to Clarke, no run short of a length, pitches middle and off, at 143ks, and what a leave. That is a touch too close to leave, but Clarke will point to the standing set of stumps;
11.3;?;Parnell to Clarke, no run wide length ball, driven straight to short cover;
11.2;1;Parnell to Warner, 1 run short of a length, 144ks, punched wide of mid-off for one;
11.1;?;Parnell to Warner, no run quick, on a length, angling in at 145ks. Defended back to him;
10.6;4;Morkel to Clarke, FOUR runs this is a touch too straight, at 146ks, nicely clipped away past square leg for four;
10.5;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run short of a length, outside off, punched to cover;
10.4;4;Morkel to Clarke, FOUR runs on a length, on off, Clarke drives at it, the weight is not coming forward this time, but the outside edge goes safely through the gap between slips and gully;
10.3;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run tries the fuller one, but Clarke's weight is forward, and he defends well;
10.2;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run oh my. That has thudded into AB's gloves. And so it should. It is a bouncer at 149.4ks. Down the leg side. He stays inside the line of it;
10.1;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run quick, rising into the chest, 145ks. Keeps it down with the fend;

JimDavis: "SOS will have to go back to his old nickname - Bagel"
 Innings Start
11.47am Smith has stunned everybody by declaring. Captains usually change into their whites before calling players back in. He had shown no signs he was going to declare any time soon, and suddenly he got up and waved the players in. The target is 448. South Africa get 71 overs today. So weather forecast has played some part in this move. It is a positive brave declaration despite being one bowler short in all likelihood. Clarke shakes Amla's hand as they walk off. Be back in 10

14.5;4;Lyon to Amla, FOUR runs nicely bowled. Gets this to dip, creates distance between Amla's stride and the pitch of the ball, but Amla recovers well closes the face, uses soft hands, gets four off the inside half of the bat. Through fine leg, and down the slope;

13.5;4;Siddle to Amla, FOUR runs beautiful drive. Siddle pitches it wide, and on a length, Amla is not near the pitch of the ball but drives on the up, to the right of that short cover staring at him;

12.4;?;Lyon to Amla, no run tossed up on middle and leg, defended to leg;

12.2;?;Lyon to Amla, no run more in control of the drive this time, but straight to mid-off;
12.1;?;Lyon to Amla, no run nicely tossed up. Gets some dip too. Amla is having to drive in front of the body the moment he decides to drive. Gets a massive inside edge onto the pad, and the ball rolls to Haddin, who tires a stumping, but Amla has never left his crease;
11.6;W;Siddle to Elgar, OUT Siddle has got one. This should slow South Africa down. Short of a length, outside off, this holds its line a touch, he tries an adventurous punch, gets the edge through.

4.6;?;Johnson to Elgar, no run fuller one this time, and has been left alone outside off;
4.5;?;Johnson to Elgar, no run another blow on the Elgar shoulder from Johnson. He wore a few in the first innings too. This is quick and short and headed for the protea badge on the lid. Elgar drops his wrists, but it still catches the top glove, and loses the sting. It's that shoulder that has saved it from lobbing up in the air;

4.1;W;Johnson to Smith, OUT Johnson bursts through Smith's defence. Full and quick, 147ks, just outside off, angling in, Smith defends in front of his body, and edges it onto the stumps.

 Innings Start
It's close to 7pm. I don't have the replay of the last ball of the match, but I have a suspicion that even though Lyon hit it, it was caught off the pad by silly point. We can wait for the highlights to sort it out because the scorebook says Lyon lbw Elgar. It is a great fightback by South Africa, and as Michael Clarke gracefully said, they were outplayed by the hosts in both the departments. The way Morkel drew life out of this dead pitch, I will never forget. That is the most hostile I have even seen him. I mean he even bowled a bouncer at 153ks. And then in the second innings, what a bowling change to bring Duminy on, and then that crazy angry man Steyn just ran through the rest. This is great Test cricket, and the good news is, we have a decider this time. Starts on March 1 in arguably the most beautiful city of all, at arguably the most beautiful ground of all. Do tune in. This is Sidharth Monga faring you well. Cheers . And do check in PE if it rains tomorrow. Oh Test cricket, you little beauty
Waiting for the presentation
"Our first innings was crucial," says Michael Clarke. "Credit to South Africa. They outplayed us throughout the Test. Both with ball and bat. Steyn was exceptional today, and Morkel's pace and bounce in the first. Having said that we knew this was coming our way, so we should have done better. Going to be a great third Test, no doubt. Exciting for the game."
"It's been amazing," says Graeme Smith. "A lot of emotion in the public. The key was to make it count. Key guys coming in under pressure and performing exceptionally well. Such high expectations from Dale. He is expected to take five every time. Today he got his bit between the teeth with the ball reversing. Great drama for cricket today. The crowd enjoyed it, the band made it really difficult to tell the nicks. I hear PE is getting the Boxing Day Test so that's great. I always felt we would get better in the series. The biggest challenge was we hadn't played a lot of cricket together, being away for T20. Looking for ward to Cape Town. It is going to be exciting."
"Speechless," says JP Duminy, the Man of the Match. "The way we stuck to our guns. Outstanding. The spell from Dale. It means a huge amount. Been a long time coming. Especially in Tests. Was under pressure. Team was under pressure too so getting this is very satisfying."
Still gathering breath here. What a turnaround from South Africa. Australia, no doubt, will be bitter about that extra half hour. They had three wickets in hand. Personally, I don't like this concept because I like matches to end of their own volition, but there indeed has been a precedent of an extra half hour with three wickets left. Happened at Edgbaston 2005
6.31pm That's more than one hour after the scheduled stumps, but that is time enough for South Africa to finish this on the fourth day. Not for nothing are they the best side in the world. The joy on their faces tells it all. Not for the first time were they challenged, but this one was a big challenge in the shape of a drubbing at a home Test. They needed to respond well, and how well they have responded
The crowd is still chanting songs. What a great day for them. The band, the players, they were all tuned up. Elgar took the wicket, and went flying, ABD caught him on the way down, Smith was next to them. The whole balcony was ecstatic. The moment of Smith hugging Steyn is great. Steyn, angry throughout, is finally smiling. Oh Test win. There is no better feeling
73.4;W;Elgar to Lyon, OUT Elgar ends it. He started the comeback with a gritty innings. He ends it with a spectacular offbreak to trap him lbw. This pitches leg, turns away sharply, Lyon is deep in the crease, and he is gone. By the way, it might have looked plumb, but Lyon got an outside edge onto it. No reviews left, though, How cruel. Also, I am not sure if it was caught off the pad. If it was, it is still out;Nathan Lyon lbw b Elgar 0 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

72.2;2;Duminy to Siddle, 2 runs Siddle punches to cover for one;
72.1;W;Duminy to Rogers, OUT Rogers is gone. Run-outs from mid-off and mid-on have been crucial this summer in South Africa. Alviro Petersen, who is not playing this match, has done the job as the substitute. Rogers has pushed this to mid-off for a risky single, Petersen hits the stumps, and this one is really really tight. The bail has taken an eternity to come off, but does so a split-frame before Rogers makes it. Rogers gets a standing ovation for his effort, but he might have got too cheeky with this so as to put Siddle at the end of the part-time spinner;Chris Rogers run out (sub [AN Petersen]) 107 (332m 237b 12x4 0x6) SR: 45.14;
71.6;?;Philander to Siddle, no run full, this time swinging the other way, aimed for that leg-before, but Philander is not as quick as Steyn, and Siddle gets his bat down in time;

71.1;?;Philander to Siddle, no run on a length, angling in, defended well;
70.6;4lb;Steyn to Rogers, 4 leg byes bowls the bouncer to keep him on strike. Rogers ducks into it, wears one on the helmet. This has got him on the back of the head. This flies over the cordon for leg-byes;
70.5;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run bouncer, on the stumps, ducks under it;
70.4;1;Steyn to Siddle, 1 run Duminy has hurt himself. He has dived on the ball at point trying to keep Siddle on strike. His ribs have landed on the ball. Siddle makes the single. Duminy has caused a divot where he fell. They send back the physio because they are running out of time. How callous. I am sure if they can win tonight those saved moments will be much sweeter;
70.3;?;Steyn to Siddle, no run short of a length, outside off, Siddle plays inside it, although this has moved back in. Close to getting the edge;
70.2;?;Steyn to Siddle, no run short of a length, outside off, Siddle remains inside the line of it;
70.1;?;Steyn to Siddle, no run full, swinging in late, Siddle gets an inside edge. He doesn't have much clue about it, though;
69.6;?;Duminy to Rogers, no run short of a length, outside off, punched to point. Siddle wants the single but is sent back. He would have run himself out had he gone for this;
69.5;?;Duminy to Rogers, no run down the wicket again, keeps this one out. Duminy rushing through this over;

68.6;W;Steyn to Harris, OUT and Steyn thinks this can be finished off tonight. This one nips back in from just outside off, nips back sharply, beats the fighting bat of Harris, hits him in front of leg. The umpire takes a long time before raising his finger. Harris reviews it. The projector shows it to be hitting the top and outer corner of the leg stump. It stays with the umpire;Ryan Harris lbw b Steyn 6 (49m 29b 1x4 0x6) SR: 20.68;
68.5;?;Steyn to Harris, no run well down leg, don't need to do much with that;
68.4;?;Steyn to Harris, no run what drama. Short of a length, outside off, he gets a bottom edge, the ball bounces perilously close to the stumps, and while he tries to keep it away he gets an edge on the second hit. Almost plays on while trying to defend his wicket. This would have been a first;
68.3;4;Steyn to Harris, FOUR runs on a length, swinging too far down, clipped away past the diving keeper for four;
68.2;?;Steyn to Harris, no run short of a length, angling in, defended off the back foot;
68.1;?;Steyn to Harris, no run brute of a delivery. Short, rising, into the body, has hit the glove, but Harris has kept it down;
67.6;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run oh what a twist. The extra half hour ahoy? Maybe not. The only question here is, did it carry to AB? The umpire has given him out, but they have convinced him to check the catch. This is going way down leg, Rogers has got a tickle, AB seems to have taken a one-handed stunner way down leg. AB gets a hand to it on the full, but the ball bounces before he takes control of it. The time taken to arrive at this decision has pushed the clock over. Will be get the extra half hour?;
67.5;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run short of a length, angling in, hits the pad, Morkel is running back to bowl the next ball. 75 seconds to go;
67.4;4;Morkel to Rogers, FOUR runs pushed with an open face, past point, and Duminy lets it trickle to the boundary so that Rogers doesn't get strike in the next over;
67.3;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run tries the big reversing yorker, but Rogers is playing superbly. He as kept this out, and his feet are nowhere near it;
67.2;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run on a length, just outside off, defended from the crease. There is a puff of dust but not much else;
67.1;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run bouncer, easily ducked under, because it is too short;
66.6;?;Steyn to Harris, no run on a length, outside off, shapes back in, but not enough. Left alone;
66.5;?;Steyn to Harris, no run nearly draws the edge. That is the sucker ball. Short of a length, wide, Harris thinks he can got after this one, but is beaten by the bounce;
66.4;?;Steyn to Harris, no run accurate, on the stumps, but Harris is equal to it. Goes right back and defends;
66.3;?;Steyn to Harris, no run drives, uppishly, but it doesn't carry to mid-off. This was full outside off, almost a half-volley;
66.2;?;Steyn to Harris, no run bowls the short one, into the thigh pad, doesn't get the edge, though;
66.1;?;Steyn to Harris, no run this one holds its line outside off, and has been left alone;
65.6;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run wide length ball, left alone, I think Rogers has seen enough to be able to trust Harris;
65.5;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run short of a length, just outside off, holds its line against the angle. Defended;
65.4;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run a yorker outside off, it takes the inside edge, but AB does well to collect this shooter;

65.1;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run dug in short, down the leg side, stays inside its line;
64.6;?;Steyn to Harris, no run ends with an inswinger that is full, but Harris keeps this out too. Stays away from the line of it, and uses his bat;
64.5;?;Steyn to Harris, no run this one swings in from just short of a length, Harris keeps it out. His feet are out of the way;
64.4;?;Steyn to Harris, no run accurate, on a length, on off, Harris defends watchfully;
64.3;?;Steyn to Harris, no run another ball negotiated as this one swings in too far, and is defended to leg;
64.2;?;Steyn to Harris, no run full and swinging in, defended to mid-on;
64.1;?;Steyn to Harris, no run sharp inswinger from Steyn. Rogers wants to get him off strike, but Harris is ball-watching, which is next to the stumps. Harris starts to run late, and is sent back. AB rushes in to try to run him out, and also gets Harris in the arm with his foot. Apologises immediately;
63.6;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run on a length, outside off, left alone;
63.5;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run short of a length, on off, defended back to him;
63.4;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run appeal for a catch down leg, and SA review again. This short of a length, on the pads, he gets inside the line, and there is a sound and a deflection as it passes his body. Illingworth says no. Replays show only his hip involved. South Africa have no more reviews left;

60.6;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run stretches out to meet a wide ball, but can't beat cover;
60.6;1w;Steyn to Rogers, 1 wide and he bowls one wide outside off to deny him the strike. The umpire does well to call it;
60.5;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run pushed through outside off, swinging away, left alone. Surely he is setting him up for the one that comes back in;
60.4;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run bouncer down the leg side, easily avoided;

59.2;?;Philander to Harris, no run short of a length, middle, defended back;
59.1;W;Philander to Johnson, OUT another review. Smith is desperate for wickets tonight. This is a better shout than the previous one, though. Short of a length, middle and leg, moves back in, hits him in front, and while the umpire thinks it is headed too far down leg, this is hitting the top of leg. Finally Smith gets a review right. Forty-two minutes to take three wickets to end this one tonight;Mitchell Johnson lbw b Philander 6 (28m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 54.54;
58.6;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run this one turns in sharply from that rough, possible bat-pad but it goes over short leg. They want a single but Philander swoops in from short fine. His throw ricochets off the stumps, but Morkel is alert at short third;
58.5;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run flat, shortish, defended to leg;
58.4;1;Elgar to Johnson, 1 run down the track to take this on the full and drive it to long-on;

58.2;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run down the wicket, reaches the pitch of it, plays this to short midwicket;
58.1;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run gets this to land on that foot mark, but Rogers has padded it away;
57.6;?;Philander to Johnson, no run on a length, middle and off, shaping back in, hits the inside half of the bat;
57.5;?;Philander to Johnson, no run short of a length, on off, punched back to him;
57.4;1;Philander to Rogers, 1 run length ball on the pads, clipped away for one;
57.3;2;Philander to Rogers, 2 runs short of a length, on the pads, he has bunted this between deep square and deep midwicket to bring up a superb century amid all the talk of his being dropped. He is pumped up, and it shows. Smith applauds too;
57.2;2lb;Philander to Rogers, 2 leg byes too far down leg again, and concedes more leg-byes. Poor Rogers, he would have seen his century in this ball;
57.1;1lb;Philander to Johnson, 1 leg bye short of a length, holds its line, hits the pad, but it is headed down leg;
56.6;4;Elgar to Rogers, FOUR runs reaches 98 driving a leg-side half-volley through square leg. He has fought hard all afternoon. Deserves these slightly softer runs this over;
56.5;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run defends one outside off;
56.4;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run short of a length, into the pads, he wants to work this to leg, but it doesn't quite come on;
56.3;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run tossed up, drops on him, defended back to him;
56.2;4;Elgar to Rogers, FOUR runs lovely shot to get into the 90s. Takes this wide half-volley and drives it past cover for four;
56.1;1;Elgar to Johnson, 1 run starts with a fullie, has been driven to long-on for one;
55.6;?;Philander to Rogers, no run too far down leg again, goes off the thigh pad, AB puts in a dive. The ball bounces in front and hits his face. No damage done, though;
55.5;?;Philander to Rogers, no run full, on off, defended back to him;
55.4;?;Philander to Rogers, no run huge lbw shout. It is sailing over on this pitch, according to Illingworth. Philander seems to agree, but Smith reviews it nonetheless. Seams in from short of a length from around off, hits the pad first, but over the knee roll. It is sailing over, according to the projection too. Sometimes you think Smith doesn't review based on the merit of the decision, but based on the batsman. Rogers is the last specialist so he says, why not;
55.3;4lb;Philander to Rogers, 4 leg byes moves back in, but goes too far down leg, and concedes four leg-byes;
55.2;?;Philander to Rogers, no run driven on the up, but straight to cover;
55.1;?;Philander to Rogers, no run on a length, middle and leg, defended off the back foot;
54.6;4lb;Steyn to Johnson, 4 leg byes this one swings too far down leg, touches the thigh pad on the way, goes for four;
54.5;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run quick, 144ks, angling in, defended in front of the pad;
54.4;4;Steyn to Johnson, FOUR runs that has taken off on a pitch that nothing has carried. Full, swinging away, 142ks, and it has exploded from a foot mark, and hit the shoulder of the bat and flown over the cordon;
54.3;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run this is the one that goes the other way, and from a short of a length. Almost an explosive offcutter. Johnson is fending, as tail do, but is beaten by a long way;
54.2;?;Steyn to Johnson, no run bowls the full one, angling in, at 143ks, defended solidly;
54.1;1;Steyn to Rogers, 1 run on a length, shaping in, he is now allowed easy singles. Rogers takes one. Johnson on strike now;

53.1;?;Philander to Rogers, no run short of a length, on off, defended form the crease;
52.6;W;Steyn to Haddin, OUT repeat of the first-innings dismissal. What an absolute gem from Steyn. It is the dip that revere swing comes with and the late swing that does Haddin in. It falls alarmingly for Haddin, who is nowhere near the pitch of the ball, and then it moves in to beat the inside edge and flatten the middle stump. An angry Dale is not good for batting sides;Brad Haddin b Steyn 1 (18m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 8.33;
52.5;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run the inswinger at 141ks, but starts too straight, and is headed too far down leg, and makes AB dive full length to his left;
52.4;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run short of a length, outside off, that's quick, at 144ks. Left alone;
52.3;1;Steyn to Rogers, 1 run slower ball, shortish, 120ks, on the pads, worked away for one;
52.2;1;Steyn to Haddin, 1 run full outside off, shaping away, Haddin has seen it, he pushes it late, gets a single to cover;
52.1;1;Steyn to Rogers, 1 run on a length, on off, dropped towards cover to reach 87;

49.4;?;Duminy to Haddin, no run full, outside off, defended to mid-off;
49.3;?;Duminy to Haddin, no run length ball, turning in from outside off, defended off the back foot;
49.2;5;Duminy to Rogers, 5 runs worked away off the pads, should have got a single, but gets five thanks to a wild throw from Steyn. That adrenalin is still flowing in Steyn's body. Calm down there, Dale. Or maybe not. These fives won't do it for Australia;
49.1;?;Duminy to Rogers, no run flighted on middle and leg. Defended;
48.6;?;Steyn to Haddin, no run he avoids it. This is a touch too short and a touch too wide outside off. Left alone;
48.5;W;Steyn to Smith, OUT ... and he is already the old batsman. Steyn is on absolute fire. Like the buses, he has had to wait, but he has now got two in a row. Inswinger followed by outswinger to take the edge followed by the inswinger to trap him lbw. Too good for a new batsman. Steyn fires this in, just outside off, on a length, and reverses in to beat the bat and hit him plumb in front. Two golden ducks in the innings;Steven Smith lbw b Steyn 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
48.4;W;Steyn to Clarke, OUT what a catch. Faf du Plessis has pulled off a stunner standing so close to the stumps at second slip. You have to acknowledge first of all that this slip cordon is very close here. Steyn gets this to swing away after the inswinger, takes the edge, which is always dying, but du Plessis takes the catch when falling forward. Sweet as. Steyn is absolutely thrilled with this;Michael Clarke c du Plessis b Steyn 1 (22m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 6.25;
48.3;?;Steyn to Clarke, no run and there comes the inswing. Dipping, swinging late, headed towards top of off. Clarke is back, plays late, with soft hands, defends;
48.2;1;Steyn to Rogers, 1 run on a length, angling away, goes off the outside half of the bat;
48.1;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run on a length, outside off, defended off the front foot;
47.6;?;Duminy to Clarke, no run full and straight, pushed back to him;
47.5;?;Duminy to Clarke, no run flat, a dart really, and du Plessis might have saved with that dive at short cover;
47.4;1;Duminy to Rogers, 1 run full, on middle and leg, driven to long-on for one;
47.3;?;Duminy to Rogers, no run flighted high, drifting in, hits the inside half of the bat as it doesn't turn;

47.1;?;Duminy to Rogers, no run short of a length, outside off, punched to point;

46.4;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run short of a length, wide again. Left alone;
46.3;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run fuller, closer to off, 145ks, reversing away. Left alone;

46.1;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run short of a length, wide, gets good carry, bowled at 141ks. Left alone;
45.6;1;Philander to Clarke, 1 run this one moves back in, but Clarke is equal to it this time, gets a single past cover;
45.5;?;Philander to Clarke, no run lovely delivery, and captain Clarke is very tentative. Short of a length, moves away, Clarke plays a neither-here-nor-there push. beaten Philander is adamant this be reviewed. Smith is almost laughing when denying him. He knows there is no edge here;
45.4;?;Philander to Clarke, no run wide length ball, shapes away, left alone;
45.3;?;Philander to Clarke, no run slightly fuller, moving in, middle and leg, defended to leg;
45.2;?;Philander to Clarke, no run short of a length, punched to cover;
45.1;?;Philander to Clarke, no run edged first ball. Holds its line in front of off, Clarke pushes tentatively. It falls well short;
44.6;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run bouncer, just outside off, he sways out of its line;
44.5;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run huge appeal. Worth a review, I think. Fullish, hitting leg. Has it straightened enough to have pitched within the stumps? Umpire doesn't think so. Smith doesn't think so. Both are right;
44.4;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run short of a length, middle and leg, swinging away towards off, opens him up a little. Defended well in the end;
44.3;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run nice drive walking into it, pushed to cover;
44.2;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run swinging down leg;
44.1;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run length ball outside off, defended off the front foot;
43.6;W;Philander to Marsh, OUT Marsh has bagged a pair. Who would have thought he scored a sensational hundred last match? Excellent ball given Marsh's state of mind after the first-innings duck, but in effect Marsh has missed a leg-stump half-volley because he is playing too square. The ball is swinging a touch, enough, to pitch within the stumps and hit then hit them;Shaun Marsh lbw b Philander 0 (5m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
43.5;1;Philander to Rogers, 1 run short of a length, pushed wide of cover for a single;
43.4;?;Philander to Rogers, no run slightly wider this time and Rogers doesn't go chasing. He is looking pretty solid;
43.3;?;Philander to Rogers, no run length ball outside off, driven to cover. Pretty close to his body with that push;
43.2;?;Philander to Rogers, no run short of a length, on off, defended off the back foot;
43.1;?;Philander to Rogers, no run short of a length, on off, angling away, left alone;
42.6;W;Morkel to Doolan, OUT finally Doolan is gone. This was a freight train coming. He has been pushing loosely outside off for far too long. Morkel bowls in that channel outside off, gets it to reverse away, takes the edge, and Smith takes a superb low catch in front of him. Smith had moved up a step after that previous one didn't carry to him. Top fielding at first slip;Alex Doolan c Smith b Morkel 5 (61m 43b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.62;
42.5;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run short and wide, at only 136ks, is left alone;
42.4;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
42.3;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run a beauty from Morkel. Holds its line outside off, beats the edge as Doolan pushes into that blind alley;
42.2;1;Morkel to Rogers, 1 run follows this one, plays with an open face, guides it past point;
42.1;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run full, on off, reversing away, left alone. He has to either bring one back in or go round the wicket;
41.6;?;Philander to Doolan, no run left alone outside off;
41.5;?;Philander to Doolan, no run Doolan is the new cat around. He is edging but it is not going to hand. A firm drive to the reverse-swinging ball, gets an edge, but it doesn't carry to Smith at first slip. A half-volley. Doolan needs to tighten up, though;
41.4;1;Philander to Rogers, 1 run full outside off, pushed wide of cover for one;
41.3;?;Philander to Rogers, no run on a length, outside off, pushed in front of the body, slightly wide of mid-off, but they don't go for the single;
41.2;1;Philander to Doolan, 1 run too full, too straight, worked away fine to fine leg;
41.1;?;Philander to Doolan, no run short of a length, around off, defended back to him;

40.5;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
40.4;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run Doolan is living a charmed life here. He is getting drawn into loose shots outside off too often. This is floated wide outside off, swings away late, and nearly takes the edge;
40.3;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run full, swinging away, but a touch too full, and has been dug out well;
40.2;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run too wide to make him play again;
40.1;?;Morkel to Doolan, no run wide length ball, shapes away, left alone;
39.6;?;Philander to Rogers, no run swinging in, from middle and off, defended to mid-on;

39.2;1;Philander to Doolan, 1 run short of a length, on off, he manages to pull it square for one;
39.1;?;Philander to Doolan, no run length ball, outside off, left alone. This is moving away late;
38.6;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run left alone outside off to end the over;
38.5;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run this one moves with the angle, outside off, and has been left alone;
38.4;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run definite reverse swing there. Full, moving away late, draws a tentative push from Rogers, but misses the edge;
38.3;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run short of a length, outside off, slight movement away, defended with an open face;
38.2;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run another wide length ball, left alone;
38.1;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run length ball, angling away, left alone;

37.4;2;Philander to Rogers, 2 runs length ball, seams back in a touch, worked away to deep square leg for two;
37.3;1;Philander to Doolan, 1 run driven on the up this time, and gets a single to cover;
37.2;?;Philander to Doolan, no run short of a length, holds its line outside off, left alone;
37.1;?;Philander to Doolan, no run first-ball wicket? They are checking if this has carried. This looks good for South Africa. ABD is confident. I think that has bounced on AB's finger, but don't think this will be given. I think Doolan deserves the benefit of the doubt. This is short of a length, holds its line, he is playing away from the body. Not sure he has edged it, but the ball is dying in front of AB. It's a centimetres job. I wouldn't be complaining either way with this decision;
36.6;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run full and wide, moving away, left alone;
36.5;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run defended back to him again. Steyn has to be riled up;
36.4;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run length ball, angling in, defended back to him;
36.3;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run huge appeal for a catch at the wicket. Not given, and they are not reviewing it. The doubt has been cast by the incoming delivery, though. He follows one widish delivery, and there is a noise as it passes the bat. Umpires don't think so. Replays show he has cued it. Both Hot Spot and Snicko confirm it. Smith has not got DRS right this match. I think it is AB who has dissuaded him here;
36.2;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run full, outside off, don't think Rogers has seen that it is meant to swing back in. Not close enough to the stumps, though. Has it cast the doubt, though?;
36.1;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run short of a length, angling in, fended in front of the chest;
35.6;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run full, flat and quick, defended easily;

35.3;?;Duminy to Rogers, no run flighted on middle and leg, defended back to him;

35.1;?;Duminy to Rogers, no run flighted, middle and leg, turned to square leg;
34.6;?;Steyn to Doolan, no run this is on target, swinging in towards off, but is a touch too short, and has been defended;
34.5;?;Steyn to Doolan, no run big reverse-swing, but too far down leg. AB has to dive;
34.4;1;Steyn to Rogers, 1 run he gets one to come back in, but it starts a little short, and has been deflected to leg for one;
34.3;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run this one holds its line outside off, but Rogers is quite disciplined here;
34.2;2;Steyn to Rogers, 2 runs short of a length, nudged away past short cover for a couple;

33.6;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run flighted outside off, right forward in defence;

33.4;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run flat, length ball, defended off the back foot;
33.3;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run flighted outside off, this time he is more sure of the movement and smothers the turn;
33.2;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run shimmies down, unsure of where he is going, but manages to reach the pitch of the ball with his reach;
33.1;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run short of a length, outside off, stays back to defend;
32.6;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run a length ball, swinging in, Rogers wants to keep it out, dabs it towards slip;
32.5;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run angling in, misses the inside edge, but is headed down;
32.4;1lb;Steyn to Doolan, 1 leg bye huge appeal but solitary and highly optimistic. This is quick and moves in late, but starts on the middle, and is missing leg easily;
32.3;?;Steyn to Doolan, no run this is the other one, that goes straight or moves away. It is quick too, at 140ks. Doolan seems to have read it, and has left it alone;
32.2;?;Steyn to Doolan, no run it is reversing. Tailing back in late, and towards the shiny side. Doolan is forward in defence;
32.1;?;Steyn to Doolan, no run short of a length, swinging in a touch, defended off the back foot. Doolan more at home against the quick;
31.6;?;Duminy to Rogers, no run length ball, middle and off, turns away towards off, defended back to him;
31.5;1;Duminy to Doolan, 1 run short and flat, punched away to deep point;
31.4;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run tossed up outside off, a puff of dust again, pushed to mid-off;
31.3;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run down the wicket, reaches too close to the ball, and drives it to mid-on;
31.2;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run flighted outside off, Doolan is groping, and playing for the turn. Has his outside edge beaten;
31.1;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run short, outside off, punched back to him;
30.6;4;Steyn to Rogers, FOUR runs superb shot. All touch. He chases a wide delivery, which is quite full, but he opens the face late to send it to the unmanned third man;
30.5;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run half-volley from wide on the crease, Rogers plays at it, there is a puff of dust and the ball sits up. Not in control of this drive to short cover;
30.4;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run short of a length, wide, left alone;
30.3;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run full and wide, left alone;
30.3;1w;Steyn to Rogers, 1 wide called wide. This is a little harsh. This is not done as a negative ploy. And isn't that wide either. Starts wide, moves away, so perhaps fair enough;
30.2;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run fuller, outside off, angling in, defended back to him. Seemed like the slower ball. At 125ks;
30.1;?;Steyn to Rogers, no run length ball outside off, left alone;
29.6;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run full, on the pads, defended to short midwicket;
29.5;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run sharp turn, Doolan is caught back to a full ball, and draws a huge appeal as this beats the bat. He has got outside the line, though, and was playing a shot;
29.4;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run another defence off the back foot;
29.3;?;Duminy to Doolan, no run stays back to defend a length ball;
29.2;W;Duminy to Warner, OUT JP jou lekker ding. What a bowling change. Pushed in through, pitches middle and leg, straightens a little, beats the bat, which is looking to work it to leg. Illingworth has given it. Warner has reviewed it. The projection shows it to be clipping leg so the on-field decision stays;David Warner lbw b Duminy 66 (124m 73b 9x4 1x6) SR: 90.41;
29.1;?;Duminy to Warner, no run quick, angling in towards off, defended off the back foot;
28.6;1;Elgar to Warner, 1 run short this time, worked away to deep midwicket;
28.5;?;Elgar to Warner, no run turn and bounce. There is a lot happening from that foot mark if Elgar can keep firing them in there. This one hits his thigh and lobs up;
28.4;4;Elgar to Warner, FOUR runs Warner has been away from the strike for some time now, and now that he is on it, he dances down to take this on a half-volley, and drive this wide of mid-off for four;
28.3;1;Elgar to Rogers, 1 run down the wicket to drive this to long-on;
28.2;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run appeal for lbw. Rogers is caught on the back foot as this one turns in from a foot mark. Not given, but it has hit him in front of the stumps. That might have been worth a review. Clipping leg, says the projection;
28.1;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run nice drift away, and turn back in, but it is too wide to make him play;
27.6;1;Morkel to Rogers, 1 run short of a length, angling in, drops this to leg for one;
27.5;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run shortish, outside off, good carry, but this time it is left alone;
27.4;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run nearly a wicket. He has got a loose push from Rogers as this shortish delivery nips away from him. Misses the edge, though;

27.2;?;Morkel to Rogers, no run wide length ball, left alone;

26.1;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run flighted outside off, left alone;
25.6;2;Morkel to Warner, 2 runs some more luck for Warner. Tries another pull, toe-ends it over mid-on. He is really lucky it hasn't gone to hand;
25.5;?;Morkel to Warner, no run oh the shoulder. Morkel is back with the high bouncer. That has got to hurt. The crowd gets into the act too;

25.3;?;Morkel to Warner, no run fuller and outside off, left alone;

23.3;2;Steyn to Rogers, 2 runs short of a length, outside off, punched away between cover and point for two;
23.2;3;Steyn to Warner, 3 runs too full this time, Warne leans into the drive, past cover, comes back for two, and an overthrow gets him a third that takes him to a fifty. Steyn not happy at all with that overthrow;

22.1;?;Elgar to Rogers, no run flighted outside off, defended back to him;

21.5;?;Steyn to Warner, no run short of a length, 140ks, defended off the back foot. This is the Steyn that appears when nothing else is working;

16.5;?;Duminy to Warner, no run defended off the front foot;
16.4;?;Duminy to Warner, no run dropped. He has dived into Rogers while trying to take the catch. Great positioning for Rogers.
