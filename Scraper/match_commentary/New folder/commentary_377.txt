Data
3.30pm: Kieron Pollard is in outrageous form and he's dragged West Indies up to a respectable total. Though, when you consider how cleanly he struck the ball, you have to think West Indies' total is a little below par ... Australia's chase will begin in around 15 minutes, so don't go away.

Brett Lee is limbering up, with Johnson Charles facing first up ...
1.55pm: The sound of kettle drums from the TV means we are T-minus 5 from kick-off. The ODIs were tightly contested, not to mention filled to the brim with sixes - so we'll doubtless get a stinker hopefully see more of the same today.
1.40pm: News from the ground is that West Indies have won the
toss and will bat first. Australia have already announced their line-up, with James Pattinson and Daniel Christian coming into the side; West Indies will certainly be without Andre Russell - he battled injury during the ODI series and has now been ruled out of the T20Is with a hamstring injury.
There are actually several new faces in the West Indies line-up, with Nkrumah Bonner, Krishmar Santokie and Garey Mathurin all making just their second appearances in international cricket. No room for Marlon Samuels, though, despite his excruciatingly slow batting in the ODIs IPL contract and recent spell in Bangladesh's T20 league.
West Indies: 1 Johnson Charles, 2 Dwayne Smith, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Dwayne Bravo, 5 Kieron Pollard, 6 Carlton Baugh (wk), 7 Darren Sammy (capt), 8 Nkrumah Bonner, 9 Krishmar Santokie, 10 Garey Mathurin, 11 Sunil Narine
Sammy (c), Dwayne Bravo (vc), Baugh, Bonner, Darren Bravo, Charles, Mathurin, Narine, Pollard, Santokie, Dwayne Smith.
Australia: 1 David Warner, 2 Shane Watson, 3 Matthew Wade (wk), 4 Michael Hussey, 5 David Hussey, 6 George Bailey (capt), 7 Daniel Christian, 8 Brett Lee, 9 James Pattinson, 10 Clint McKay, 11 Xavier Doherty
1.35pm: It's that time again. Welcome to the first T20 international between West Indies and Australia from St Lucia. The match is due to get underway in about 25 minutes and we'll bring you news on the toss and teams shortly. In the meantime, a couple of stats: since the 2010 World Twenty20, West Indies have won two out of seven T20Is, while Australia have won three from 11. One of the those distinctly mediocre records is likely to improve today ...
 Innings Start
5.15pm: Time for the presentations ...
West Indies captain Darren Sammy: "We were looking for about 170 but the Australians bowled well and maybe outplayed us today. We have one more game in Barbados and hope to change things there. We might try to add some firepower to the bowling for the next game."
Australia's Shane Watson is the man of the match: "It's nice, good to be able to put a complete performance together. I was thinking 160-170 was a par score, it's a beautiful wicket and a pretty small boundary as well, so we thought 150 would be good to chase. One of Pollard's big hits chopped up the ball a little, so that helped us with reverse swing, so thanks big man ... With the bat, it's getting there, I'm definitely hitting the ball better now."
That, folks, is your lot. Join me for the second and deciding match on Friday. After all, what else will you have on? Cheerio
5.05pm: That was about as easy as a Jackson Five song for Australia. They take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series, with standout performances from Shane Watson and Michael Hussey, as well as decent figures for Daniel Christian. West Indies look like they need a major rethink, particularly on quicker pitches like the Beausejour one. Not even another Godzilla-like rampage from Kieron Pollard could save them in this one.
