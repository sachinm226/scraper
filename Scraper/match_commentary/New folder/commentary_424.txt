So, England will have to score 250 for victory here. Fantastic bowling from Chris Woakes who has finished with 6 for 45 - the second-best figures ever in ODIs for England. Not bad for a bloke in his second one-day international!
It was a funny sort of innings, Watson and Haddin looked like setting a good platform, as did Hussey and Clarke later on. But batsmen kept getting out after making starts. It should be a very interesting chase. Join us for the England innings in half an hour.
Ian Hale writes in: "I'm presuming the best England ODI figures are Colly against Bangladesh, where he took 6 for 30-something and got a century? What a legend that man has been for us over the years."
Quite right, Ian. Those are the best figures for England.
49.3;W;Trott to Smith, 1 run, OUT Smith swings hard, pulls it to deep midwicket and they come back for two runs, Dougie's dive at the non-striker's end is in vain - he's short as Trott takes the throw and breaks the stumps.

48.3;W;Woakes to Lee, OUT Woakes has six! And the 50th over may not be required after all. Lee has cut hard but in the air and third man takes the catch, it's the substitute fielder Luke Wright down there;Brett Lee c sub (LJ Wright) b Woakes 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

47.6;1;Anderson to Hastings, 1 run Hastings swings hard and gets it out through midwicket;

44.6;1w;Shahzad to Johnson, 1 wide oh dear, Shahzad is absolutely hobbling in here, and it's a horrible result for England as he sprays a wide and therefore has to bowl again;
44.5;4;Shahzad to Johnson, FOUR runs and Johnson launches a powerful drive back past the bowler and gets another valuable boundary;
44.4;4;Shahzad to Johnson, FOUR runs bouncer, Johnson goes for the pull and gets a top edge that sails just a few inches over the leaping Prior and runs away for a boundary;

38.1;W;Woakes to Hussey, OUT and Woakes' fine day continues! Hussey has dragged it on, trying to cut hard outside off and the ball cannons in to the off stump.

13.6;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run good ball, the yorker coming in from around the wicket keeps Marsh back and all he can do is defend;
13.5;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run Marsh leans forward with bat and pad close together and defends;
13.4;1;Woakes to Haddin, 1 run more room for Haddin, who steers this one to third man;
13.3;4;Woakes to Haddin, FOUR runs cracker! Haddin gets tired of this and gives himself some room and then powers this back over the bowler's head, and that is timed so well as it races away to the boundary straight back down the ground;
13.2;?;Woakes to Haddin, no run Woakes comes wide of the crease and angles it in to Haddin, who shapes to back away and then defends;
13.1;1;Woakes to Marsh, 1 run banged in at the hips of Marsh, who helps this on its way to fine leg;
12.6;1;Finn to Marsh, 1 run fullish on off stump, Marsh clips a single towards mid-on;
12.5;?;Finn to Marsh, no run left alone outside off;
12.4;1lb;Finn to Haddin, 1 leg bye swinging on to the pads of Haddin, who gets a leg bye;
12.3;?;Finn to Haddin, no run Finn gives Haddin some extra bounce now and he tries to back away for his old favourite slash, but this one just clunks down into the ground and bounces through to Prior;
12.2;1;Finn to Marsh, 1 run Finn squares Marsh up this time with a ball on off stump, it gets a thickish edge away through gully;
12.1;2;Finn to Marsh, 2 runs banged in a little short and outside off, Marsh uses the bounce on this to steer a cut safely over gully and it runs away to third man;
11.6;1;Woakes to Marsh, 1 run again Marsh clips a run behind square leg - plenty of gaps on the leg side for him;
11.5;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run pushes this one away defensively towards point;
11.4;2;Woakes to Marsh, 2 runs England persist with the angle in to Marsh, trying to deny him runs to the off side, and he flicks it through midwicket;
11.3;1;Woakes to Haddin, 1 run this time Haddin gets a single as he pushes gently back past the bowler towards mid-on;
11.2;?;Woakes to Haddin, no run oh, Haddin is lucky to get away with this one as Woakes angles it back in and draws an inside edge that clips the back leg and sails just over the top of the stumps;
11.1;?;Woakes to Haddin, no run Haddin drops this one at his feet and thinks about a quick single, but Marsh sends him back;
10.6;1;Finn to Haddin, 1 run soft hands from Haddin, who nudges a single to the leg side;
10.5;1;Finn to Marsh, 1 run swinging on to the pads and Marsh turns a single to fine leg;
10.4;?;Finn to Marsh, no run Marsh walks across and covers his off stump, and leaves it alone;
10.3;1lb;Finn to Haddin, 1 leg bye Finn uses his angle and bounce to nip it in to Haddin from short of a length and it flies away off the thigh just wide of gully for a leg bye;
10.2;?;Finn to Haddin, no run straighter line now and Haddin defends;
10.1;?;Finn to Haddin, no run well now, this one has really fizzed through past the outside edge and thumps into Prior's gloves - good ball;
9.6;2;Woakes to Marsh, 2 runs Marsh gets off the mark with a flick off his hips behind square leg as Woakes strays a touch;
9.5;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run fullish and angling in again, Marsh meets it with the full face of the bat;
9.4;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run angling on to the pads of Marsh, who tries to whip through square leg but can't find a gap;
9.3;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run Woakes comes around the wicket to Marsh, who defends;
9.2;W;Woakes to Watson, OUT Woakes strikes! Watson goes for a hard cut behind point but he's picked out Collingwood, whose reflexes have not dulled at all! He takes a really good, sharp catch and Watson is on his way;Shane Watson c Collingwood b Woakes 16 (41m 20b 2x4 0x6) SR: 80;
9.1;?;Woakes to Watson, no run Watson pushes to off, can't find the gap;
8.6;?;Finn to Haddin, no run fuller and angled in, hits Haddin on the pad as he can't get it away;
8.5;4;Finn to Haddin, FOUR runs ah, Finn gives Haddin just a little width outside off and Haddin backs off a touch to slash a cut over point, really well played;
8.4;?;Finn to Haddin, no run oh, what a cracking off-drive but he's hit it so hard that mid-off, who is back on the edge of the circle, collects it so quickly they can't get a single;
8.3;?;Finn to Haddin, no run this one's a very good yorker - Haddin can do nowt but keep it out;
8.2;1;Finn to Watson, 1 run Finn tries for the yorker again but it's just a touch half-volleyish and Watson drives a single wide of mid-off;
8.1;?;Finn to Watson, no run there's an lbw shout as Finn angles it in to Watson, but Rod Tucker isn't interested. It looked to be sliding down leg but Strauss wants a review. Hmm, it's hit him in line but he's quite a way forward, and the replays confirm that is missing leg. So England have lost one of their two reviews.;
7.6;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run solidly defended to off;
7.6;1w;Shahzad to Haddin, 1 wide another bad ball swinging down leg from Shahzad, and Prior can't quite take it cleanly;
7.5;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run defended away to the leg side;
7.4;4;Shahzad to Haddin, FOUR runs and another boundary, though this one was a more genuine edge. But he went hard, and it flew over the vacant second slip area - he'd have to have been Joel Garner to have any hope, even if there was a man there - and it bounces away to third man;
7.3;4;Shahzad to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin has got tired of waiting and backs off a touch to slash an upper cut over point, racing away to the boundary. The ball was short and wide enough to justify that shot, and he played it well;
7.2;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run Shahzad angles this in to Haddin, who defends;
7.1;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run soft hands from Watson as he gets a single with a push towards gully;
6.6;?;Finn to Haddin, no run another good yorker from Finn and Haddin jams the bat down to keep it out;
6.6;1w;Finn to Haddin, 1 wide strays down leg now and that one's a wide;
6.5;?;Finn to Haddin, no run good ball - Finn goes for the yorker with the angle in to Haddin and there's half an appeal for lbw but that was sliding down leg;
6.4;1;Finn to Watson, 1 run this one is driven harder along the ground past the bowler but it's only a single as Pietersen at mid-off does well to dive across and save this;
6.3;?;Finn to Watson, no run Finn goes really full again, Watson crunches it back over the bowler's head on the bounce but it's collected safely by mid-off;
6.2;?;Finn to Watson, no run good line right on off stump and Watson punches to cover;
6.1;?;Finn to Watson, no run fullish length to start with and Watson drives it back to the bowler;
5.6;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run fuller and wide of off, Haddin tries to drive but can't time it;
5.5;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run angles on to the pads of Watson, who gently clips a single to midwicket;
5.4;1;Shahzad to Haddin, 1 run Shahzad's line is all over the place, now he goes a bit short and wide and Haddin cuts hard on the bounce to third man;
5.3;4;Shahzad to Haddin, FOUR runs well played, though it was a bad ball, short and down leg, and Haddin just helps this on its way over the leg gully and there's nobody at fine leg who can save this boundary;
5.2;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run Haddin tries to work it through leg but there's a man at a sort of leg gully or short backward square leg, who cuts this off;
5.1;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run Shahzad goes for the yorker now but slightly off line, and Haddin keeps it out;
4.6;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs Watson hasn't had much of the strike the past couple of overs and he doesn't waste this delivery! Anderson dropped just a touch short and Watson lashed a pull forward of midwicket, super timing and that was always a boundary;
4.5;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run Haddin responds with a drive but not timed quite well enough to get past Pietersen at mid-off;
4.4;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run ouch! This one has jagged back in at 143kph and whacks Haddin in the midriff;
4.3;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run good bounce and carry again as Haddin leaves one outside off;
4.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run good bouncer - well directed and Haddin had to sway quickly out of the way to avoid taking that on the helmet;
4.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run and another one swings on to the pads, this one strikes Haddin on the body;
4.1;1w;Anderson to Haddin, 1 wide down leg side, another wide, from Anderson this time;
3.6;1;Shahzad to Haddin, 1 run well outside off and Haddin guides it off the face of the bat down to third man;
3.6;1w;Shahzad to Haddin, 1 wide ah, Shahzad had bowled a much better line this over but he ruins it by straying way down leg again;
3.5;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run Haddin gets right in behind this one to defend;
3.4;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run good ball, nipping back quite sharply off the seam and sailing over off stump as it's left alone;
3.3;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run Shahzad goes for the bouncer now, and Haddin ducks underneath it - after some consultation Rod Tucker and Asad Rauf decide that was legal, though it probably was too high;
3.2;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run attacking the off stump now and Haddin defends;
3.1;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run left alone outside off, and that's carried high and quick through to Prior;
2.6;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run down leg side again and Haddin gets a single;
2.5;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run angling in to the pads of Watson, who nudges a quick single through midwicket;
2.4;1;Anderson to Haddin, 1 run driven away to the off side again;
2.3;4;Anderson to Haddin, FOUR runs that's a cracking, punchy off-drive from Haddin. Really terrific timing as he just leans in to that shot and pushes it back past the bowler, Pietersen at mid-off dives across and can't save it, though he perhaps should have;
2.2;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run good ball from Anderson, probing just outside off and swinging away a fraction, Haddin defends;
2.1;?;Anderson to Haddin, no run fullish and just outside off, Haddin drives but can't beat mid-off;
1.6;?;Shahzad to Watson, no run good ball, nipping in off a good length and Watson keeps it out;
1.5;1;Shahzad to Haddin, 1 run inswing again but it's on the stumps now and Haddin softly whips a single through square leg;
1.5;1w;Shahzad to Haddin, 1 wide oh dear, well down leg again and this one goes through to Prior and is called a wide;
1.4;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run swinging down leg once again, Haddin cops it on the body as he can't get bat on ball;
1.3;?;Shahzad to Haddin, no run better line now, outside off and Haddin leaves it alone;
1.2;1;Shahzad to Watson, 1 run again it's the wrong line as Shahzad swings it well down leg, Watson clips it away for a single;
1.1;1lb;Shahzad to Haddin, 1 leg bye swinging on to the pads now and Haddin gets a leg bye;
0.6;?;Anderson to Watson, no run defended again to the off side;
0.5;?;Anderson to Watson, no run good ball, just straightening a touch without being prodigious outswing, and Watson defends;
0.4;2;Anderson to Watson, 2 runs another good cover drive, although this one has clunked a bit and hasn't been timed properly, it's chased down and they pick up two;
0.3;?;Anderson to Watson, no run a tighter line now from Anderson and Watson defends with bat and pad close together;
0.2;?;Anderson to Watson, no run fullish and swinging away, and Watson punches back past the bowler;
0.1;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs Watson gets Australia off the mark with a boundary! A fine start as he reaches across to whip a lovely cover drive through the gap along the ground;

1.20pm Time for the first ball, and it's James Anderson to Shane Watson....
1.10pm The pitch looks rock hard, so there should be plenty of bounce for the fast men but also plenty of runs if the batsmen get it off the middle. Steven Finn is making his ODI debut and he should enjoy this surface
I'm Brydon Coverdale and I'll be joined later by George Binoy and Liam Brickhill.
While we wait for the first ball, why not check out our Youtube channel, or our Facebook page. Or, to get into the spirit of this flood-relief match, you can donate to the Queensland Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal by clicking here.
12.50pm Michael Clarke has won the toss and Australia will bat.
England have made two changes, with Chris Woakes and Steven Finn both coming in to the side at the expense of Chris Tremlett, who has a minor side strain, and Michael Yardy, who has been dropped.
England 1 Andrew Strauss (capt), 2 Matt Prior (wk), 3 Jonathan Trott, 4 Kevin Pietersen, 5 Ian Bell, 6 Eoin Morgan, 7 Paul Collingwood, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Ajmal Shahzad, 10 Steven Finn, 11 James Anderson.
Mitchell Johnson returns for Australia, and he'll replace Xavier Doherty. So, obviously neither team thinks there'll be much help for the spinners out there, although Clarke also says Doherty has a bit of a stiff back.
Australia 1 Shane Watson, 2 Brad Haddin (wk), 3 Shaun Marsh, 4 Michael Clarke (capt), 5 Cameron White, 6 David Hussey, 7 Steve Smith, 8 John Hastings, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Brett Lee, 11 Doug Bollinger.
12.40pm Hello and welcome to the 5th ODI between Australia and England at the Gabba. Australia are 3-1 up so England must win to keep the series alive, while the match will also be a valuable fundraiser to help the flood relief effort.
Andrew McGlashan is at the Gabba and he says there are a few bare patches near the rope in the outfield where they've had trouble with grass growth due to the weather, and those patches have been painted green. Today is fine, and although it's clouding over just a touch, the forecast is good.
Gnasher has been in Brisbane for a few days now, and here's his account of how the city looks after the floods.
 Innings Start
So, some consolation for Australia after the Ashes with a one-day series win secured with two games to spare. It was a team effort from them with both bat and ball today, Michael Clarke finding some semblance of form with his half-century. It looked like England would push them close and perhaps even keep the series alive during Pietersen and Bell's 73-run stand, but after they were dismissed England collapsed in a heap before the tailenders slogged their way to a record-breaking, but ultimately futile, partnership. England certainly haven't been at their best in this series - Eoin Morgan's failure to fire has surely had something to do with that. He had a long break with very little cricket at all during the Tests, does that have something to do with it? England have two more games to get things right before they head to the subcontinent. With the series secured, Australia may well rest a few of the key bowlers - Brett Lee perhaps - to keep them fresh for the World Cup.
Read all about today's action in Andrew McGlashan's bulletin, and do stick with us to read some quotes from the presentation ceremony.
"We were never able to build any momentum, apart from Pietersen and Bell, and we've been very disappointed with the way we've played as a batting group in this series," says Andrew Strauss. "We've got what we've deserved. We've talked a lot about it, but talk doesn't bring you results. It's decision making in choosing which bowlers to attack and when.
"The reason we haven't got it right, I'm not sure, but hopefully we can use the last two games to fix our problems. Morgs [Eoin Morgan] has struggled, but you can't put it on his shoulders. Apart from Trott none of the batsmen have been great. We've played very badly, we certainly could've won the first two games. We haven't played smart cricket. It'll be different conditions at the World Cup. Woakes showed a lot of talent in the Twenty20s with the bat, and in this game bowled really well, hit the deck hard. The future is bright for him."
"Maybe the problem is that Eoin Morgan has now been worked out and his technical deficiencies exposed, in the way that they have been in Tests and even in 2nd Divisions County cricket where he has struggled to make an impact in recent seasons?" ponders Mark Kidger. "I wonder if he will still be in the side this time next year (and I hope that I am wrong on this)..." The thing is, if you look at his dismissals, he's getting out to bad balls or trying to do to much - soft dismissals rather than specific types of deliveries finding him out.
"I'm pleased with my performance with the ball today," says Chris Woakes. "The ball seemed to follow the fielders a bit. It would've been sweeter if it had resulted in a win. The wicket was slightly two-paced. I don't know about the World Cup," he says when asked if he's still harbouring hopes that in injury might somehow get him a place at the tournament. "I'm not in the side at the moment!"
"It was a very nice feeling to contribute with the bat, and to win the series," says Michael Clarke. "I thought 230 to 240 would've been a good effort. The wicket was a bit two-paced. Everyone contributed throughout the game, Brett Lee bowled really well too. Most importantly, plenty of money was raised for the flood appeal. There was a great turn-out today. England have done their bit with donations too."
That's all from your commentary team, George Binoy, Brydon Coverdale and Liam Brickhill. Join us again for the 6th match of the series at Sydney on Wednesday (14:20 local, 03:20 GMT). Until then, goodbye!
45.3;W;Watson to Finn, OUT there it is, finally. Another ugly heave from Finn, the ball flicks the bail and that's a series win for Australia. Although not without a few flutters during this partnership, you'd think;Steven Finn b Watson 35 (34m 24b 5x4 1x6) SR: 145.83;
45.2;?;Watson to Finn, no run just past the off stump! Finn looked like a batsman hitting that six, now he's a tailender as he closes his eyes and swings wildly to leg;
45.1;6;Watson to Finn, SIX runs into the stands! What a shot from Finn, gunbarrel straight, a monstrous hit and there's the fifty partnership. Highest 10th wicket partnership by England in an ODI;
44.6;?;Lee to Anderson, no run on a length, angling across the left-hander and he pulls his bat inside the line to leave;
44.5;?;Lee to Anderson, no run full and straight, Anderson defends awkwardly to cover;
44.4;2;Lee to Anderson, 2 runs Anderson backs right away to leg and slashes a square drive out into the deep. They run hard and are easily back for the second when the throw arrives at the stumps;
44.3;?;Lee to Anderson, no run back of a length, Anderson tries to run it down to third man but ball beats bat;
44.2;?;Lee to Anderson, no run yorker, outside off, and it slips right under Anderson's bat;
44.1;3;Lee to Finn, 3 runs well Finn has got an excellent connection on this one too! Full and straight from Lee, the batsman cracks it in the air to wide long-on and only a great piece of fielding from Hastings saves the boundary;
43.6;?;Bollinger to Anderson, no run Anderson backs away, trying to open up the off side, but completely misses a length delivery from Bollinger;
43.5;1;Bollinger to Finn, 1 run much fuller, slapped to long-on for one;
43.4;4;Bollinger to Finn, FOUR runs another boundary for Finn! He picks up the length early and swings this away to wide midwicket;
43.3;1;Bollinger to Anderson, 1 run tapped straight to Hussey at cover, they set off for a suicidal single and the throw is wide;
43.2;?;Bollinger to Anderson, no run Anderson gives himself acres of room as Bollinger fires in a yorker outside off, in fact Anderson has given himself so much room that he almost tumbles over towards square leg. Nowhere near hitting it;
43.1;?;Bollinger to Anderson, no run that's more like it. On a length and aimed at the stumps, tapped to gully;
43.1;3nb;Bollinger to Anderson, (no ball) ooh, that's nasty. That's slipped out as a very high full toss - a beamer really - at about sternum height. The ball evades Haddin too;
42.6;4;Lee to Finn, FOUR runs another slower ball, this time he spots it and clobbers it over midwicket!;
42.5;?;Lee to Finn, no run slower-ball bouncer from Lee, an almighty heave from Finn but he doesn't get near it;
42.4;?;Lee to Finn, no run full and fast again, Finn makes room and taps gently to cover;
42.3;?;Lee to Finn, no run Finn is knocked off his feet by a searing yorker! Somehow he's found a way to keep that out...;
42.2;?;Lee to Finn, no run big swing, big miss;
42.1;1;Lee to Anderson, 1 run slashed down to third man for one;
41.6;4;Bollinger to Finn, FOUR runs straight back over the bowler's head, baseball style! Well, England may not have any chance of winning this, but the batsman are having fun. Making a bit of dosh for charity too, which is good;
41.5;?;Bollinger to Finn, no run now he's charging down the track and slogging wildly, Bollinger pushes it slightly wider of off and Finn gets nowhere near it;
41.4;4;Bollinger to Finn, FOUR runs heaved into the leg side, that's found the gap and Finn collects another boundary!;
41.3;1;Bollinger to Anderson, 1 run Bollinger aims for the yorker, gets it slightly wrong and Anderson gets bat on the full toss to pick up another single;
41.2;1;Bollinger to Finn, 1 run full and straight, swiped across the line into the leg side;
41.1;?;Bollinger to Finn, no run just short of a good length, Finn positions himself for an ambitious pull but the ball flies between bat and body and through to the keeper;
40.6;1;Lee to Finn, 1 run on a length around off stump, Finn gives himself some room and cracks it towards mid-off. Clarke does well to cut the shot off;
40.5;?;Lee to Finn, no run fired full and straight, but Finn's bat comes down in good time;
40.4;?;Lee to Finn, no run short again, dealt with much more effectively this time;
40.3;?;Lee to Finn, no run short, and Finn is left lying on the ground in ungainly fashion as he gets out of the way of that. Slower-ball bouncer. Finn obviously likes the feel of the wicket against his derriere, he falls over enough when he's bowling;
40.2;1;Lee to Anderson, 1 run tapped down just to gully's right, they hurry through for one;
40.1;?;Lee to Anderson, no run Anderson immediately backs away and tries to cut, past the edge;
39.6;4;Bollinger to Finn, FOUR runs England's tailenders are enjoying themselves now! Just short of a good length, Finn just opens his stance and swings this straight down the ground, standing to admire the shot as the ball sails away;
39.5;1;Bollinger to Anderson, 1 run slower ball from Bollinger, not picked at all by Anderson who is through with the shot before the ball gets to him, but they pick up one into the leg side all the same;
39.4;4;Bollinger to Anderson, FOUR runs slap! Anderson is starting to middle a couple now. He comes charging down the wicket and smashes this through extra cover;
39.3;3;Bollinger to Finn, 3 runs not the worst shot by Finn, backing away and cracking a length delivery up and over cover. Not enough on it to reach the boundary, however;
39.2;?;Bollinger to Finn, no run England's No. 11 is ducking now as Bollinger sends down a bouncer. One for the over, says the umpire;
39.1;?;Bollinger to Finn, no run full on off stump, Finn taps to mid-on;
38.6;?;Watson to Anderson, no run well, he was aiming to send this one into the stratosphere, just shutting his eyes and heaving wildly to leg. Nowhere near it;
38.5;4;Watson to Anderson, FOUR runs that one's come out of the middle! Smeared over mid-on by Anderson, one bounce and over the rope;
38.4;?;Watson to Anderson, no run fuller, wider, and driven off the toe of the bat to cover;
38.3;?;Watson to Anderson, no run dug in short, past Anderson's grille as he plays a classic tailender's waft;
38.2;?;Watson to Anderson, no run on a length, guided down to that man at deep gully/short third man;
38.1;?;Watson to Anderson, no run short on off stump, Anderson gives himself room and flashes wildly, play-and-a-miss;
37.6;W;Bollinger to Shahzad, OUT there we go! Very full outside off, Shahzad flings his bat into a drive and a thick edge ends up nestled in a tumbling Brad Haddin's gloves. Australia just one wicket away now;Ajmal Shahzad c ?Haddin b Bollinger 9 (26m 23b 0x4 1x6) SR: 39.13;
37.5;?;Bollinger to Shahzad, no run yet again past the edge. Surely, eventually, he'll get a touch on one of these?;
37.4;?;Bollinger to Shahzad, no run there's spite and malice in this bouncer! Shahzad was in no position to play it, throwing the hands out. The ball takes the splice of the bat and lobs up, falling just past the stumps;
37.3;?;Bollinger to Shahzad, no run tapped down defensively to gully, nothing in the batsman's half;
37.2;?;Bollinger to Shahzad, no run banged into the pitch, the ball rises past the edge of the bat;
37.1;?;Bollinger to Shahzad, no run Shahzad continues to cling limpet-like to the crease, defending this;
36.6;1;Watson to Shahzad, 1 run full on middle and leg, flicked to midwicket;
36.5;?;Watson to Shahzad, no run and he follows that up with studied defence;
36.4;6;Watson to Shahzad, SIX runs Shahzad takes full toll, swinging mightily to send a length ball sailing over wide long-on! 84 metre boundary there;
36.4;1nb;Watson to Shahzad, (no ball) great line and length from Watson, again he's past the edge, but he's over-stepped so the next ball is going to be a Free Hit;
36.3;1;Watson to Anderson, 1 run and Anderson rotates the strike straight away with another quick single;
36.2;1;Watson to Shahzad, 1 run nudged off the hip, and an easy single into the leg side;
36.1;?;Watson to Shahzad, no run appeal as a good bouncer hits something on the way throught to Haddin ... was that off the shoulder? Not off the bat, reckons Umpire Rauf, and calls one for the over;
35.6;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run just short of a length, tapped down to point;
35.5;1;Johnson to Shahzad, 1 run aimed at the top of middle, nudged to short third man and there's utter confusion between the three Englishmen out there - Shahzad has a runner remember - which really should've resulted in a run-out. The throw is wide, however;
35.4;?;Johnson to Shahzad, no run this one hits the seam and jags away, past the edge for the umpteenth time;
35.3;?;Johnson to Shahzad, no run bouncer from Johnson! He's got Shahzad hopping nervously, and the umpire calls one for the over with a wide smile on his face;
35.2;?;Johnson to Shahzad, no run dug in shorter and much faster by Johnson, the ball rises on Shahzad but he rides the bounce and plays it down to gully;
35.1;?;Johnson to Shahzad, no run on a length, but outside off and Shahzad leaves alone;
34.6;?;Watson to Anderson, no run short on off stump to end the over, Anderson tries to uppercut it but again can't get a touch on it. Watto wanders down and stares in disbelief. Could easily have a had a third wicket any number of times in this over;
34.5;?;Watson to Anderson, no run booming cover drive this time ... but he hits nothing but fresh air;
34.4;4;Watson to Anderson, FOUR runs edged! Off the shoulder of the bat though, and the ball loops over a leaping second slip;
34.3;?;Watson to Anderson, no run another nervous swish from Anderson, not sure how much longer England's tail can survive these conditions;
34.2;?;Watson to Anderson, no run back of a length, outside off and oast the edge;
34.2;1nb;Watson to Anderson, (no ball) another bouncer from Watson, this is much too short and balloons over the batsman;
34.1;?;Watson to Anderson, no run short on off stump, Anderson sways out of the way;
33.6;?;Johnson to Shahzad, no run pushed full again but slightly wider of off, yet again the ball flies past the edge of the bat;
33.5;?;Johnson to Shahzad, no run the bowler attacks the stumps, this time the bat comes down in time to keep the ball out;
33.4;?;Johnson to Shahzad, no run Johnson is firing it past the edge at will when he gets it right, as he does now. Shahzad's feet go nowhere as he stands at the crease to defend;
33.3;?;Johnson to Shahzad, no run Shahzad is forward and driving without any great conviction, and he's easily beaten on the outside edge;
33.2;?;Johnson to Shahzad, no run Johnson re-adjusts his line, a nervous waft from the batsman;
33.2;1w;Johnson to Shahzad, 1 wide not the greatest follow-up, much too wide outside off stump;
33.1;?;Johnson to Shahzad, no run sharp bouncer greets Shahzad! He wears it on the chest, and there are plenty of words being flung around too;
32.6;W;Watson to Woakes, OUT bouncer and it's caught behind! Watson has two in his first over! Woakes has tried to hook this one and got a tickle through to Haddin;Chris Woakes c ?Haddin b Watson 8 (27m 25b 0x4 0x6) SR: 32;
32.5;?;Watson to Woakes, no run tries to force this through leg but can't connect;
32.4;?;Watson to Woakes, no run pushed away defensively;
32.3;?;Watson to Woakes, no run tickled down leg side and is that a dropped chance? Haddin diving to his left has missed the take with his left hand, but it's hard to see what that has come off - perhaps off the trousers. Not bat.;
32.2;?;Watson to Woakes, no run pushed away defensively to the off side;
32.1;W;Watson to PD Collingwood, OUT and Watson strikes with his first ball! Collingwood decided he was going after the medium-pacer and lofted it high over mid-on, Hastings began in the circle and ran halfway back to the boundary to take an outstanding catch running with the flight of the ball.;Paul Collingwood c Hastings b Watson 18 (34m 27b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
31.6;?;Johnson to Woakes, no run and that's a maiden, as Woakes defends the last ball;
31.5;?;Johnson to Woakes, no run pushed to point and can't find a run;
31.4;?;Johnson to Woakes, no run again the angle across Woakes is difficult for the batsman, who tries to drive and is beaten;

31.2;?;Johnson to Woakes, no run beaten outside off this time;

29.4;?;Johnson to Woakes, no run bouncer now from Johnson, and it's ducked by Woakes;
29.3;?;Johnson to Woakes, no run angled across Woakes, who cuts to backward point;
29.2;1;Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 run again it's soft hands from Collingwood, who nudges a single to midwicket;
29.1;1;Johnson to Woakes, 1 run banged in on the hips and it's clipped uppishly to square leg;
28.6;?;Smith to PD Collingwood, no run oooh, a touch edgy here as Collingwood leans forward and gets it off the shoulder of the bat, the ball lobs up but well short of Smith;

28.4;1;Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run driven down towards long-on, just another gentle single;

28.1;?;Smith to Woakes, no run pushed back to the bowler who does his own fielding;
27.6;?;Hastings to PD Collingwood, no run beaten outside off, just a good length delivery that angles in and Collingwood played the wrong line;
27.6;1w;Hastings to PD Collingwood, 1 wide but this one is called a wide as Collingwood walks across outside off and Hastings sends it much wider;
27.5;?;Hastings to PD Collingwood, no run bouncer, and this one looked too high but the umpires have been very lenient today on such decisions and again a wide is not called;
27.4;2;Hastings to PD Collingwood, 2 runs soft hands now as Collingwood clips through midwicket and races back for two runs;
27.3;4;Hastings to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs a good shot now from Collingwood, he's just forced this flick wide of mid-on, just placed well enough to find the gap and it runs away for a boundary;
27.2;?;Hastings to PD Collingwood, no run driven towards mid-off this time and can't find the gap;

25.5;1;Hastings to Woakes, 1 run Woakes gets off the mark straight away with a thickish edge to third man;
25.4;W;Hastings to Bell, OUT gone! Bell has played on and Hastings has got rid of both the well-set batsmen in KP and Bell. This one swings in and Bell tries for the late cut, the movement does him in and his bottom edge runs on to the off stump;Ian Bell b Hastings 36 (77m 61b 1x4 0x6) SR: 59.01;
25.3;?;Hastings to Bell, no run slower ball - and much slower at 104kph - and it's driven to mid-on;

22.6;?;Smith to Bell, no run Bell reaches at this one and pushes to point;
22.5;W;Smith to Morgan, OUT another one goes! Morgan has holed out to Smith! Not a very clever piece of batting, you'd have to say, as he gets underneath a lofted drive and skies it to long-off, where Johnson runs around to his right and takes a catch that nearly bobbles out of his hands.;Eoin Morgan c Johnson b Smith 2 (5m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;

21.5;?;Hastings to Morgan, no run on the pads and Morgan can't get it away;
21.4;W;Hastings to Pietersen, OUT Pietersen is gone! Oh, John Hastings has done it with the slower bouncer! It has absolutely stopped in mid-air on the way to Pietersen, who wants to pull hard but is playing too quickly and ends up swinging one-handed and gets a top edge that's taken by Lee at mid-on;Kevin Pietersen c Lee b Hastings 40 (68m 51b 4x4 0x6) SR: 78.43;
21.3;2;Hastings to Pietersen, 2 runs driven hard through cover for another easy run;
21.2;1;Hastings to Bell, 1 run slower ball now, which is chipped through square leg and they can't justify a second run;
21.1;?;Hastings to Bell, no run lovely fielding by David Hussey at gully, as he launches himself to his right to save a good late cut from Bell that might have run away to the boundary;
20.6;?;Smith to Pietersen, no run good bowling, Pietersen advances and Smith sends it in flatter and quicker, the batsman has to check his shot again;

18.5;?;Smith to Bell, no run tossed up on leg stump, it's clipped to midwicket;
18.4;2;Smith to Bell, 2 runs well played by Bell as he takes this one off middle stump and dabs a paddle sweep fine enough to get two runs;
18.3;1;Smith to Pietersen, 1 run quicker and flatter, and it's punched through cover;
18.2;?;Smith to Pietersen, no run solidly defended back to the bowler;
18.1;1;Smith to Bell, 1 run Bell advances to Smith and drives edgily and uppishly over cover point, it bounces safely short of the fielder;

16.6;?;Smith to Pietersen, no run tossed up and Pietersen drives back to Smith, who dives and nearly makes a catch, but there's no reaction from anyone. Hold on, though, Smith is saying he's not sure if he's taken it. He's come up with the ball clutched to his body. Asad Rauf believes it's not out but checks with the third umpire, who can easily see that ball has hit the hands, bounced while Smith is diving and then he has clutched it to his chest. Not out.;
16.5;?;Smith to Pietersen, no run tossed up on middle stump, Pietersen clips to Hussey at short midwicket;
16.4;?;Smith to Pietersen, no run a big stride forward from Pietersen as Smith drags the length back, the batsman defends;

14.6;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run inside edge ... the ball rolls back close to the stumps but Pietersen shows good awareness to quickly flick it away and avert the danger;
14.5;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run short and pacy from Johnson, Bell is hurried as he tries to pull ... the ball hits something though, the bat handle or the glove, and they take a single;
14.4;?;Johnson to Bell, no run nicely straight from Johnson, Bell stays deep in the crease and defends;
14.3;?;Johnson to Bell, no run this time it's Smith at point doing the fielding, diving to his left to stop Bell's shot. Good effort from him;
14.2;?;Johnson to Bell, no run tapped down, straight to the man at gully on the bounce;
14.1;?;Johnson to Bell, no run Bell hops down the track and sends the ball back to the bowler ... KP had backed up quite far and Johnson was on the ball in a flash, he's safely back to his crease though;
13.6;?;Hastings to Pietersen, no run straighter from Hastings, Pietersen taps to point;
13.5;4;Hastings to Pietersen, FOUR runs great shot, intelligent batting. Back of a length and Pietersen picks up four with the latest of late cuts, a deft little shot that beats third man;

13.3;1;Hastings to Bell, 1 run nicely driven by Bell, stretching well forward, but there's a sweeper out on the cover boundary;

13.1;1;Hastings to Pietersen, 1 run pushed into the gap between mid-off and cover, quick single;
13.1;1w;Hastings to Pietersen, 1 wide Pietersen charges down the wicket but Hastings spots him coming and responds with a canny slower-ball bouncer ... that's a bit too short though, and it's called wide;
12.6;?;Johnson to Bell, no run and defence to finish the over;
12.5;4;Johnson to Bell, FOUR runs back of a length, Bell makes room and flaps over mid-off. White sprints after it but can't pull it back in time;
12.5;1nb;Johnson to Bell, (no ball) everything was right about this ball, tucking Bell up nicely in defence, except for the fact that he's been called for a no-ball. That's a bit harsh, he was certainly tight on the line but it was a borderline call. Free Hit coming up;
12.4;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run a bit of bat, a bit of pad, and as the ball rolls to midwicket - with Johnson in hot pursuit - they scamper through for one;
12.3;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run chopped down to third man;
12.2;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run nudged into the leg side for one;
12.1;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run just past the edge! Great line from Johnson, Pietersen had to play at that. Slip, who had been moved, is back in place;

11.5;1;Hastings to Bell, 1 run now he does find space, running one down to third man for an easy single;
11.4;?;Hastings to Bell, no run tapped down towards cover, no single to be had;
11.3;?;Hastings to Bell, no run aggression from Bell, charging down the track but his drive can't pierce the off side field;
11.2;?;Hastings to Bell, no run coming in through the air and off the seam, Bell defends with bat and pad right together;
11.1;1;Hastings to Pietersen, 1 run good start from him, this ball has just started to stick in the surface and do a little, and yet another edge flies off the bat and down to third man;
10.6;?;Johnson to Bell, no run defended down to gully off the back foot;
10.5;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run tapped to deep mid-off, and a single is taken;
10.4;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run direct hit would've been interesting here! Pietersen dropped it into the off side and both batsmen left their creases ... but Smith swoops in a flash and fires a shy at the non-striker's end. Bell dives, and the throw goes wide. He'd have been out if that had hit;
10.3;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run defended watchfully into the off side;
10.2;4;Johnson to Pietersen, FOUR runs the first really testing delivery Johnson has bowled today, and it goes for four! Pietersen was caught on the crease, the ball leaving him off the pitch and taking a thick edge. That beats slip, but goes fine enough to beat third man too;
10.1;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run glanced behind square on the leg side;
9.6;1;Bollinger to Bell, 1 run flashed airily through gully! That would've resulted in a regulation catch in a Test match, but here it's a single down to third man. Keeps the bowler interested though, and that's the end of the first Powerplay;
9.5;1;Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run tapped to deep mid-off for one;
9.4;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run extravagant leave to follow that up, KP struts down to tap the wicket;
9.3;4;Bollinger to Pietersen, FOUR runs Pietersen is counter-attacking in fine style here, lunging forward to smash this through the covers. There's no stopping that;
9.2;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run offcutter from Bollinger, slower and stopping in the wicket. Pietersen pushes into the leg side;
9.1;1;Bollinger to Bell, 1 run squirted into the off side, Hussey is still close in in that catching position at cover, he dives to his left and gets a hand to it but can't quite stop the single;
8.6;2;Johnson to Pietersen, 2 runs Pietersen steps right across to the off side and clips a leg-stump delivery out into the deep ... Fine leg is up but deep square sprints across to keep them to two;
8.5;1;Johnson to Bell, 1 run tucked off the pads into the leg side;
8.4;1;Johnson to Pietersen, 1 run full and straight, Pietersen pushes firmly back to the bowler, who parries to his right to give away a single;
8.3;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run that'll have stung the hands of Hussey at short extra cover! Full and wide, absolutely slammed out the middle but straight at the fielder. He can see the funny side. Great effort to even stop that actually;
8.2;4;Johnson to Pietersen, FOUR runs slapped straight back down the ground, the ball scorches across the turf and over the boundary. Strong shot!;
8.1;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run decent start, just short of a good length but aimed right at off stump. Pietersen gets across and defends to leg;
7.6;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run going across the right-hander on the angle, going further off the seam, and Bell leaves alone;
7.5;2;Bollinger to Bell, 2 runs short and Bell is on the pull, that hits the splice and loops up slowly ... but it's got enough on it to evade the fielder running back from square leg;
7.4;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run pushed to cover point;
7.3;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run Bell smelt that one, a bouncer bursting past his helmet and into Haddin's gloves. The 'keeper appeals, who knows why;
7.2;?;Bollinger to Bell, no run left alone outside off stump;
7.1;1;Bollinger to Pietersen, 1 run on a length and defended by Pietersen ... who spots the opportunity for a quick single as mid-off is slow to amble in to field. Hands on hips from Bollinger;
6.6;?;Lee to Bell, no run languid drive from Bell, a good-looking shot but it goes straight to the fielder;
6.5;1;Lee to Pietersen, 1 run full, straight and fast. Pushed just wide of mid-on and they dash through for one;
6.4;?;Lee to Pietersen, no run tapped into the covers;
6.3;2;Lee to Pietersen, 2 runs a thick outside edge bounces down to third man ... and the return from the fielder is atrocious, yorking Haddin and they come back for another;
6.2;1;Lee to Bell, 1 run short again, Bell flails and pops it straight up in the air. The crowd roar as Smith takes the catch, they perhaps don't quite realise what's going on ... Lee's got a smile on his face;
6.2;1nb;Lee to Bell, (no ball) no, short and ballooning over the ducking batsman. And what's more, he's over-stepped - it's a no-ball and his next delivery will be a Free Hit;
6.1;W;Lee to Trott, OUT gone first ball! Lee strikes again! It wasn't the best ball, a touch short and angling down the leg side. Trott flicked off his hip but in the air, and Bollinger tumbles forward at short fine leg to take the catch. England are in disarray. Brett Lee is on a hat-trick...;Jonathan Trott c Bollinger b Lee 0 (7m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
5.6;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run and another good leave to end the over;
5.5;2;Bollinger to Pietersen, 2 runs fuller, the batsman leans forward into a cautious drive and is off the mark with a scurried two;
5.4;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run hurled down on a length, outside off, and left alone;
5.3;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run thick inside edge, that could so easily have gone back to hit the stumps! Luckily for Pietersen, it hits the body and bounces harmlessly towards the slips;
5.2;?;Bollinger to Pietersen, no run slower ball, a cutter, and it's pulled down quite short. Pietersen defends;
5.1;W;Bollinger to Strauss, OUT two wickets in two balls! Both openers depart, England are in a hole now. Short, Strauss was quickly onto the pull but the ball didn't come off the middle of the bat, flying straight to Smith at square leg for an easy catch;Andrew Strauss c Smith b Bollinger 3 (24m 16b 0x4 0x6) SR: 18.75;
4.6;W;Lee to Prior, OUT bowled 'im! Lee has comprehensively won this battle, firing one at the top of off. Prior's feet went nowhere, the ball bursts past his attempted nurdle to gully and makes a mess of the stumps. Lee celebrates with a hop and a kick, and that's the first breakthrough for Australia!;Matt Prior b Lee 14 (22m 15b 3x4 0x6) SR: 93.33;
4.5;?;Lee to Prior, no run close to the edge! That actually sounded like he may have got something on it, plenty of daylight between bat and ball however;
4.4;1;Lee to Strauss, 1 run so instead, he tucks into the wide spaces on the leg side, picking up a single;
4.3;?;Lee to Strauss, no run again Strauss targets the off side, but he can't find the gap as short cover point fields the ball on the bounce;
4.2;?;Lee to Strauss, no run tapped into the off side;
4.1;?;Lee to Strauss, no run at the other end, Strauss's absorbing battle with Lee continues! The batsman backed away to leg but Lee followed him with a sharp bouncer that had him ducking for safety, and a verbal barrage to boot!;
3.6;?;Bollinger to Prior, no run back of a length again, this time he opts to defend back down the track;
3.5;4;Bollinger to Prior, FOUR runs crack! All that effort from Bollinger as he charges to the crease, only to see the ball ping out of the middle of the bat and fly to the boundary in a moment. Authoritative pull from Prior, he's ticking nicely now;
3.4;1;Bollinger to Strauss, 1 run width outside off, Strauss chops down to third man;
3.3;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run that's definitely hit the seam, jagging back in, and Strauss is caught in an awkward position as he sets himself for some sort of paddle-pull. The ball strikes him in the midriff and rolls into the off side;
3.2;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run wobbling around on a length, just outside off. Strauss punches into the covers, but hits the field;
3.1;1;Bollinger to Prior, 1 run Prior clears the left leg and slaps down the ground ... that won't reach the boundary, however, as deep mid-off swoops to cut it off;
2.6;1;Lee to Prior, 1 run tucked into the leg side, and they take the chance for a sprinted single;
2.5;?;Lee to Prior, no run and he follows it up with a much slower delivery! Spotted early by Prior, who drives to mid-on;
2.4;?;Lee to Prior, no run fuller this time, Prior is sat on the back foot though and drives to cover. Lee's fastest ball of the innings so far;
2.3;?;Lee to Prior, no run this one leaps off a length and hits the splice as Prior hops back in defence;
2.2;1;Lee to Strauss, 1 run now the England captain is slashing up and over down to third man! Both batsmen keen to impose themselves early on, but this didn't bounce too far away from the fielder, Bollinger;
2.1;?;Lee to Strauss, no run back of a length, with a hint of width. Strauss steps back and cracks into the off side, but straight to the cover fielder;
1.6;4;Bollinger to Prior, FOUR runs slashed, and that flies over gully and down to third man for four! Prior is really flinging his bat into these shots, that was a thick edge but it raced away;
1.5;?;Bollinger to Prior, no run and he follows that up with some back-foot defence;
1.4;4;Bollinger to Prior, FOUR runs unorthodox, but effective! Back of a length and Prior initially set himself to pull over midwicket. The ball hit the seam and moved towards the slips, but he went through with the shot and ended up lifting it straight back over the bowler's head. One bounce, and over the rope;
1.3;?;Bollinger to Prior, no run it's been a spirited start by Australia's new-ball bowlers, and this time Bollinger hits a length and the ball bursts past the outside edge;
1.2;?;Bollinger to Prior, no run pace and bounce, and Prior didn't know much about that! He turns his head away and thrusts the bat out in hope ... but the bouncer ricochets off the glove and grille. That's got the crowd going;
1.1;2lb;Bollinger to Prior, 2 leg byes off the thigh pad and down to fine leg. That's good running, as they sprint back for the second;
0.6;?;Lee to Strauss, no run great finish to the over, curving gently in through the air but the pace is anything but gentle. Defended by Strauss;
0.5;?;Lee to Strauss, no run feisty stuff! Banged in short by Lee, Strauss whips his head out of the way in a hurry. He dealt with a good bouncer pretty well;
0.4;?;Lee to Strauss, no run a hint of movement back into the left-hander, and good pace from the bowler too. Defended back down the track;
0.3;?;Lee to Strauss, no run this time he is beaten! Lee goes fuller outside off, Strauss steps half forward into the drive but is beaten on the outside edge. Lee wanders down to offer him a few tips on his technique;
0.2;?;Lee to Strauss, no run and again. Back of a length, hitting the seam and going away from the bat. Strauss watches it carefully and keeps the bat inside the line;
0.1;?;Lee to Strauss, no run that's better! Strauss whips his bat inside the line as Lee hits a good length on off stump. A leave, rather than a miss, but the line was great;
0.1;1w;Lee to Strauss, 1 wide pacy start, but wildly inaccurate from Lee. Hurled well wide of off stump, and one of those slips was almost in action to stop that - before Haddin moved across;

Welcome back everyone, I'm Liam Brickhill and I'll be your commentator for the beginning of the second innings. The latest news is that Shaun Marsh has injured his hamstring and won't field. Brett Lee is pawing the turf at the end of his run - he'l take the new ball. Two slips in place.
