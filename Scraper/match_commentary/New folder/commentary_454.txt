Data
11.40 am Lunch is at noon so, with ten minutes for the change of innings, Sri Lanka will have about ten minutes to negotiate before the break. Have Australia got enough? Well they've got the sort of first-innings score that makes for a cracking Test.
Daniel Alexander: "Aus bowled out for 316 on SSC pitch!! SL will take it any day." Given the SSC's record, this is true.
Time: "300+ is always a good score when you get sent in." That is also true.
104.3;W;Eranga to Hussey, OUT bowled him! Eranga caps a fine performance on debut with a slower ball, Hussey comes forward to push at it but gets an inside edge on to the stumps. Hussey goes after a terrific century - his 15th in Tests - and steering Australia past 300;Michael Hussey b Eranga 118 (253m 178b 12x4 2x6) SR: 66.29;

104.1;?;Eranga to Hussey, no run good length delivery angling across Hussey, who lets it go;
103.6;?;Herath to Lyon, no run that's the one that goes straight through and Lyon didn't pick it, I think he got an inside edge on to the pad else it would have been a good shout for lbw;
103.5;2;Herath to Lyon, 2 runs oops, Lyon attempts the big sweep and doesn't execute it well at all, gets a bottom edge that misses stumps and keeper;

98.3;W;Welegedara to Copeland, OUT caught at second slip! Copeland has a flash at one that angles across him from over the wicket. He edges it hard but straight to Mahela Jayawardene at second slip and he's taken far harder catches than this. That was a low catch though, Jayawardene got his fingers under the ball just in time. Copeland seemed to take Jayawardene's word for it after he claimed the catch;Trent Copeland c Jayawardene b Welegedara 1 (9m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 12.5;

97.5;?;Herath to Copeland, no run left alone outside off stump;
97.4;1;Herath to Hussey, 1 run there is it! Test century No. 15 for Michael Hussey. He gets there with a nudge off his pads behind square. His team-mates applaud as he takes off his helmet to celebrate, and cool down a touch.;
97.3;?;Herath to Hussey, no run comes down the pitch again and plays it to short midwicket;
97.2;?;Herath to Hussey, no run Hussey comes down the track to get to the pitch of the ball and hits it towards midwicket, can't find the gap;

96.2;W;Welegedara to Johnson, OUT caught at point! The ball from Welegedara is short of a length and rather wide outside off, Johnson could have hit that hard through cover but he just opened the face and spooned it gently towards point instead, an easy catch for Herath;Mitchell Johnson c Herath b Welegedara 8 (42m 29b 1x4 0x6) SR: 27.58;

90.3;?;Eranga to Johnson, no run much closer to the off stump, Eranga pitches in line and angles it across from over the wicket, Johnson lets it go. He's a different batsman when he has the freedom to swing, and when he doesn't;
90.2;4;Eranga to Johnson, FOUR runs Johnson's hammered this. He had the width to drive and the length was full too. Johnson freed those arms and drilled the ball through cover;
90.1;?;Eranga to Johnson, no run good length delivery outside off, Johnson shoulders arms;
89.6;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run a sharp short ball, Hussey shapes up to pull and then decides to drop his wrists and let the ball go;

88.6;?;Eranga to Johnson, no run defended on the back foot;
88.5;?;Eranga to Johnson, no run interesting one this. Johnson got hit high on the pad after the ball pitched outside leg stump. Eranga, the bowler, began to appeal for the lbw (which wasn't out) and then the fielders in the cordon went up for the catch after the ball lobbed towards second slip and was caught by Sangakkara diving forward. Did that carry? It just did. The umpire says not out to everything. Sri Lanka have no reviews left. Don't think it hit the bat. Might have hit both pads.;
88.4;?;Eranga to Johnson, no run he had the width to free his arms there and he tried, perhaps a little half-heartedly, and mis-timed the drive towards short cover;

86.6;?;Eranga to Johnson, no run Johnson lets one go as the ball angles across his off stump from over the wicket;
86.5;W;Eranga to Haddin, OUT loud appeal for caught behind and Haddin's been given, he isn't happy with the decision and asks for a review. The ball pitched on a good length outside off and seamed away a touch, Haddin did not come forward and pushed at it. There was a noise as it passed the bat and there's no conclusive evidence to suggest there was no edge. Haddin has to go. An odd one. You'd assume no batsman would review if he had nicked it, so either he didn't or he didn't know he did.;Brad Haddin c ?Jayawardene b Eranga 35 (85m 57b 6x4 0x6) SR: 61.4;

85.4;4;Lakmal to Hussey, FOUR runs that's awfully short, and Hussey is so quick to judge the length that he could have played two pull shots. He moved back and thumped it in front of square, all along the ground;
85.3;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run Lakmal pitches outside off from round the wicket and angles the ball in, Hussey moves forward and lifts his bat out of the way;
85.2;4;Lakmal to Hussey, FOUR runs another terrific drive, from Hussey this time. He leans forward to a full ball outside off and drives fluently all along the ground through extra cover;
85.1;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run left alone outside off stump;
84.6;4;Welegedara to Haddin, FOUR runs edged wide of second slip and there's no third slip! Haddin reached out for one and tried to drive it through cover though the length wasn't that full. He got a thick edge that flew safely past the diving Jayawardene at second slip;

83.6;1;Lakmal to Haddin, 1 run full length and on the pads, Haddin tries to flick but doesn't make proper contact;
83.5;4;Lakmal to Haddin, FOUR runs edged but short of gully! Lakmal went over the wicket to the right-hander and bowled a full ball just outside off, which moved away a touch. Haddin drove hard from his crease and sliced the ball hard and low towards gully;
83.4;1;Lakmal to Hussey, 1 run he pitches slightly short and angles the ball into Hussey, who swivels and pulls towards deep square. He didn't time that well;
83.3;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run too wide outside off from Lakmal, Hussey doesn't bother with it;
83.2;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run good length but the ball angles across Hussey from over the wicket and he lets it pass;

82.1;?;Welegedara to Hussey, no run good length outside off, Hussey plants a foot forward and lets the ball go;
81.6;?;Lakmal to Haddin, no run that would have been a good ball to Hussey, but Haddin is a right-hander, so Jayawardene has to move towards his left to collect down leg side;
81.5;3;Lakmal to Hussey, 3 runs full length and this time the line is too close to off stump to leave, Hussey moves forward and drives through cover point;
81.4;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run good length and the line is a fraction closer to the left-hander outside off stump, Hussey thinks about playing it and then decides against it;

75.3;1;Welegedara to Hussey, 1 run slower ball, he plays in front of his body, but there is no cover in place to catch this. Yet again Hussey crosses fifty, well on his way to a possible Man-of-the-Series award. Acknowledges the applause from the balcony;

All Indians who are up in arms because of the omission of Azhar's name in the consecutive centuries at the start of the career list, please not we are talking centuries in consecutive innings, and not consecutive matches
 Innings Start
11.35 pm So Sri Lanka finish with a lead of 157. They scored 45 runs off 19 overs this morning and lost four wickets. Thirteen of those runs were scored by the last man Lakmal. Mathews made his maiden Test century but Sri Lanka had a poor session. They do have a sizeable lead though and Australia's openers will be under pressure when they walk out in ten minutes.
The focus will shift from Mathews to Australia's ability to fight. Benno has the first word: "Now it's time to see what Clarkes new outfit is really made of. If Hughes and Watson don't make any impression on this lead Sri Lanka will have this game won be tea tomorrow - weather permitting of course."

35.6;W;Johnson to NT Paranavitana, OUT caught at short cover by Ponting, whose reflexes I covet. The ball was ordinary, full and outside off, there to be driven.

137.5;?;Copeland to HAPW, no run closer to off, defended back to the bowler;
137.4;2;Copeland to HAPW, 2 runs this time Copeland provides him the width, and he uses Copeland's pace (!) to guide it past point. Opens the bat face late, and plays it along the ground;

137.2;?;Copeland to HAPW, no run soft hands and a defensive shot this time;
137.1;2;Copeland to HAPW, 2 runs PJ is edgy here. Nothing special with the bowling, but he has lost concentration a bit here. Plays this uppishly without any control, but somehow places this smack between the two short midwickets. Perfectly catchable height;
136.6;?;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, no run full and straight, played back to Lyon;
136.5;?;Lyon to Angelo Mathews, no run worked around the corner;
136.4;1;Lyon to HAPW, 1 run against the run of play, PJ comes down the track and lofts him down the ground. It is not a chip, just that he hasn't hit it well, and it falls short of long-on;

134.6;4;Johnson to HAPW, FOUR runs after the short one, catches him on the back foot with a fullish offcutter. The edge, though, is soft, bounces well short of slips, and then bisects them;
134.5;4;Johnson to HAPW, FOUR runs short, 144ks, sits up rib-high, and this time he has played a cracking pull. Right into the ground, past Tony Hill at square leg, who - I might add - had no chance of fielding it;
134.4;?;Johnson to HAPW, no run slower offcutter, 130ks, pitches leg, defended in front of off;
134.3;?;Johnson to HAPW, no run on a length, middle and leg, defended in front of off;

132.5;3;Johnson to HAPW, 3 runs short, doesn't get up high, and is pulled from rib-high, into the ground, past midwicket;

132.3;?;Johnson to HAPW, no run this one starts wider, and thus left alone;
132.2;?;Johnson to HAPW, no run that's well bowled, this is not just the angle, but the off cut on it. Pitches just outside off, PJ plays for the angle, but it seams further away and beats the edge;

6.6;?;Copeland to NT Paranavitana, no run left alone once again;
6.5;?;Copeland to NT Paranavitana, no run left alone outside off stump;
6.4;?;Copeland to NT Paranavitana, no run loud shout for lbw as Paranavitana gets hit on the pad while trying to defend on the front foot. Aleem Dar says not out and Clarke decides to review after thinking about it for a while. It was a good length ball that pitched in line and angled back into the left-hander instead of seaming away. That looks dead plumb. But replays indicate it's an umpire's call for some reason. The replays indicate that would have hit off stump. Perhaps the majority of the ball was not hitting the centre of the stump or something, but that looked so out. He's been saved by the smallest of fractions.;

131.1;1;Lyon to HAPW, 1 run short of a length, pushed between point and cover, and they charge through for a single;
130.6;?;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, no run defended solidly off the front foot. No action on the ball, although words have flown this way and that;
130.5;?;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, no run defended solidly to silly mid0off, Johnson follows through next to the batsman. I must add that he does have a smile on his face although the chat doesn't seem very pleasant;
130.4;?;Johnson to Angelo Mathews, no run not sure Johnson is listening to Dar. Left alone by Mathews only to turn up and see Johnson giving him some more lip;

 Innings Start
Two more overs left in the game before they can pull the plug. The SL openers will have to pad up and turn up. The Aussie fielders will come and take their positions. A new ball will lose a bit of its newness. Get ready for 12 utterly pointless balls. Unless of course, they decide to not end the game at that stage, which would be worse.
"Right ! Game on. 331 off 20. T20 stuff." You're either sarcastic or optimising, Glenda. Either way, it is fans like you that make cricket a fun game!
138.5;W;Eranga to Copeland, OUT end of the story. Aus don't refer that. It is caught at slip. Eranga again bends it in as Copeland looks for a flatfooted drive and gets the outside edge. Smartly held by the man at slip tumbling across to his left.;Trent Copeland c Paranavitana b Eranga 3 (33m 23b 0x4 0x6) SR: 13.04;
138.4;1;Eranga to Lyon, 1 run Eranga swings it in again, it is worked off the pads through square leg.;
138.3;?;Eranga to Lyon, no run another lbw appeal as Eranga swerves one in. But this one is clearly headed away from the stumps.;
138.2;?;Eranga to Lyon, no run Australia have decided to refer everything! This looked close to plumb. And it was given by Aleem Dar. This is called the Shaun Marsh over-compensation. Angled in from just outside off, it nips in and hits the front pad in front of middle and leg. Aha! Aleem has got this one wrong, would you believe it. It was going down the leg. Only just, but it was. Everyone is susprised and looking a little sheepish.;
138.1;?;Eranga to Lyon, no run short of a length and straightening outside off, Lyon pulls the bat inside the line.;
137.6;?;Herath to Copeland, no run looped up outside leg, Copeland plays it to the on side.;

137.4;?;Herath to Copeland, no run better this time, gets forward and defends.;
137.3;?;Herath to Copeland, no run Is that Herath's 8th? No! SL are confident Copeland gloved the reverse-sweep up in the air, before Mahela dived away to take a tumbling catch. Tony Hill says no and they are out of reviews.;
137.2;?;Herath to Copeland, no run Copeland negotiates this better, defended solidly.;
137.1;?;Herath to Copeland, no run unplayable ball from Mars. Lands outside leg and breaks away while bouncing like Garner had delivered it. Past the end, and into Mahela's hands, over his head, at slip.;
136.6;?;Lakmal to Lyon, no run Lyon survives the over, defends solidly to mid-off.;
136.5;?;Lakmal to Lyon, no run Lyon hangs back in the crease and lets a ball zip by wide of off stump.;

136.2;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run yorker, actually a low full toss, and Copeland digs it out.;
136.1;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run Lakmal sends down another bouncer, Copeland ducks and weaves.;
135.6;W;Herath to Siddle, OUT Siddle's given lbw and immediately refers it. Angled in from wide of the crease, it landed on middle and leg, and straightened past the bat that came around a little slowly. Hit in front of leg, and Siddle must be on his way soon. Straightforward. 7 for 157 for Herath.;Peter Siddle lbw b Herath 26 (43m 34b 4x4 0x6) SR: 76.47;
135.5;?;Herath to Siddle, no run Herath keeps it flat on middle and Siddle defends.;
135.4;4;Herath to Siddle, FOUR runs Siddle's finding the middle. He skips out confidently now, gets to the length of a ball sent down from round the stumps and drills it to the left of mid-on for four more.;
135.3;?;Herath to Siddle, no run lands outside leg and breaks in, Siddle pads it away.;
135.2;4;Herath to Siddle, FOUR runs tossed up generously, and Siddle laps it up with a sumptuous on-drive for four. Is the declaration waiting for his 50?;
135.1;?;Herath to Siddle, no run flighted outside leg, padded away once more.;
134.6;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run goes fuller this time, Copeland mistimes the drive but plays it back to the bowler.;
134.5;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run Copeland shows you just how not to play the short ball. Lakmal bounds in and gets this to angle in, Copeland tries to pull, changes his mind belatedly and ducks after the ball whizzed by.;
134.4;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run full and dipping in to Copeland who defends to wide mid-off.;
134.3;?;Lakmal to Copeland, no run full ball outside off, shaping in and it misses the inside edge.;

98.4;4;Lakmal to Hussey, FOUR runs top-edged but safe. Lakmal bangs the bouncer in, and Hussey looks to pull. It balloons off the top edge but goes too fine for fine-leg to get there. SL in trouble here.;
98.3;3;Lakmal to Clarke, 3 runs the runs are a-flowing. Back of a length ball, all timing from Clarke as he plants a solid punch back down the track.;
98.2;1;Lakmal to Hussey, 1 run slower ball attacking the stumps, Hussey inner edges it through square leg for a single.;
98.1;2;Lakmal to Hussey, 2 runs back of a length outside off, Hussey scampers two more with a soft-handed steer through point.;
97.6;2;Herath to Clarke, 2 runs they are surely looking at a declaration at some point. Clarke cuts a short ball past a sloppy effort at point and encourages Hussey to run back for the second too.;
97.5;6;Herath to Clarke, SIX runs ok, I do think Clarke is playing for a win now. He leaps out to the flight and launches a huge six over long-on. This is comprehensive, a masterclass on playing spin on the fifth day.;
97.4;4;Herath to Clarke, FOUR runs Clarke is getting a boundary every over. Short ball from Herath, turning away and sitting up like a lollypop. Clarke cuts it away fluently.;
97.3;1;Herath to Hussey, 1 run Hussey skips out now and clips to mid-on for a single.;
97.2;?;Herath to Hussey, no run beaten in the flight, but he manages to keep it out. Tossed up on off stump, he shaped to sweep and adjusted at the last moment to play with a straight bat.;
97.1;?;Herath to Hussey, no run tossed up on off stump, Hussey whips to midwicket.;
96.6;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run on a length again, Clarke shuffles across to the line of off stump and defends to mid-on.;
96.5;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run shortens the length this time, Clarke defends from the crease to the off side.;
96.4;4;Welegedara to Clarke, FOUR runs over-pitched and another four for the sparkling Clarke. He's looking better and better. Comprehensive.;
96.3;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run slower ball on middle stump, Clarke spots it and defends to the leg side.;
96.2;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run full delivery to Clarke outside off, and he drives to mid-off.;
96.1;1;Welegedara to Hussey, 1 run length ball outside off, Hussey hustles a single with a dink into the covers.;
95.6;?;Herath to Clarke, no run full on leg stump to Clarke who presses forward to defend.;
95.5;1;Herath to Hussey, 1 run he shuffles out of the crease now and works the wrists to get a single to the leg side.;
95.4;?;Herath to Hussey, no run fuller this time, Hussey easily gets to the length and works it to the leg side.;
95.3;?;Herath to Hussey, no run attacks the stumps this time, Hussey crouches on the crease and defends to the leg side.;
95.2;?;Herath to Hussey, no run shorter length this time, Hussey hangs back in the crease and defends.;
95.1;?;Herath to Hussey, no run tossed up outside off, Hussey lunges out with bat and pad close together to defend.;
94.6;4;Welegedara to Clarke, FOUR runs Clarke you beauty. Pup is pipping Sri Lanka out of contention. Full length from Welegedara, he wants Clarke driving, but not this well. Caressed into the covers with an air of finality.;
94.5;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run back of a length this time, he stays behind the line and defends.;
94.4;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run over-pitched outside off, Clarke drives languidly to short cover.;
94.3;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run fuller length to Clarke, he punches it back to the bowler on the up.;
94.2;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run short of a length outside off, Clarke lets it go to the keeper.;
94.1;1;Welegedara to Hussey, 1 run back of a length from Welegedara outside off, Hussey guides it into the covers for one.;
93.6;?;Herath to Clarke, no run Clarke leans out cautiously to kill this one out of the rough.;
93.5;4;Herath to Clarke, FOUR runs the Clarke counter-punch continues. He jumps out of the crease and launches him out of the rough over mid-on for four more.;
93.4;?;Herath to Clarke, no run;
93.3;?;Herath to Clarke, no run gets behind the line now, and defends.;
93.2;?;Herath to Clarke, no run ripper! Another escape for Clarke. It breaks away like a fiend out of the rough, but surely Prasanna should have collected it. Clarke missed it as he lunged out, and was not in the frame. Prasanna got his gloves across but could not collect it.;
93.1;?;Herath to Clarke, no run tossed up on leg stump, Clarke skips out as he kept doing in the morning and defended.;
92.6;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run Australia's session all the way. Hussey gets behind the line and defends into the off side.;
92.5;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run Dilshan spears it in on leg stump, Hussey covers the line and defends.;
92.4;4;Dilshan to Hussey, FOUR runs Hussey brings up 300. Tossed up outside off, Hussey creams it through the covers for four more.;
92.3;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run Hussey leans out again and defends into the off side.;
92.2;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run loopy ball on middle and leg from round the stumps, driven towards mid-off.;
92.1;1;Dilshan to Clarke, 1 run loopy ball from Dilshan on the pads, Clarke turns it around the corner.;
91.6;1;Herath to Clarke, 1 run Clarke gets the single this time, retains strike for the last over to lunch.;
91.5;?;Herath to Clarke, no run skips out again, and plays it to the leg side. Interesting ball, Herath tossed it up from well behind the crease.;
91.4;?;Herath to Clarke, no run he jumps out now, how many balls has he played from the castle today? Defended down the pitch, no problem.;
91.3;?;Herath to Clarke, no run Clarke presses out to the flight and defends down the track.;
91.2;1;Herath to Hussey, 1 run Hussey gets a single this time, worked carefully to the leg side.;
91.1;?;Herath to Hussey, no run the carrom ball, Hussey pulls and misses. SL are out of referrals so that can't be reviewed though Tony Hill says not out. Just as well, that was doing too much to miss off stump.;
90.6;1;Dilshan to Hussey, 1 run flicks the final ball to square leg for one. Nothing menacing on offer from Dilshan yet.;
90.5;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run straightens off middle and leg, Hussey taps to the leg side.;
90.4;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run worked off the pads quietly to the leg side.;

90.2;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run;
90.1;?;Dilshan to Hussey, no run tossed up on middle and off, lunges forward with bat and pad together, and it pops off the inside edge to the leg side. Short leg is standing too far back.;
89.6;4;Lakmal to Clarke, FOUR runs Clarke is looking better and better. Full-pitched outside off, he laces it through the covers. The Warne-Murali Trophy is getting ready to take a long flight out of Colombo.;
89.5;?;Lakmal to Clarke, no run full ball on off stump, driven into the off side.;
89.4;4;Lakmal to Clarke, FOUR runs nonsense bowling with a 7-2 field. Full and on the pads, Clarke happily tucks in with a flick for four more.;
89.3;1;Lakmal to Hussey, 1 run Hussey stays behind the line and carefully guides a single in front of point.;
89.2;?;Lakmal to Hussey, no run sharp offcutter there, has Hussey flirting with an open face, but he manages to not edge it.;
89.1;1;Lakmal to Clarke, 1 run full length on off stump, Clarke defends into the off side.;
88.6;?;Welegedara to Hussey, no run short of a length outside off to Hussey who's arms are held aloft as he leaves.;
88.5;1;Welegedara to Clarke, 1 run reaches out towards the length and opens the face to steer through point.;
88.4;4;Welegedara to Clarke, FOUR runs listless spell so far from Welegedara. A friendly length ball on the pads, Clarke nudges it off the pads with divine timing and it is four more to the skipper.;
88.3;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run length ball outside off, Clarke gets into line well and drives to mid-on.;
88.2;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run length ball angles across Clarke who shoulders arms.;

87.4;?;Herath to Clarke, no run shortens the length now, Clarke plays back to it.;
87.3;6;Herath to Clarke, SIX runs the captain has 50, and how well-played is this? He has had a couple of chances, but never really looked in trouble. He jumps out again, doesn't get to the flight this time, but goes through with his golf swing. The ball lands safely behind the long-off fence.;
87.2;4;Herath to Clarke, FOUR runs so much for giving Herath a new ball. That one just skidded along into Clarke's hitting zone, and skidding even more smoothly off his bat through the covers. Tossed up, Clarke steps out and the ball purrs away.;
87.1;1;Herath to Hussey, 1 run tosses up the shiny cherry on middle and leg, Hussey runs out to the pitch and works it to mid-on.;
86.6;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run makes him play with a full ball nipping away from middle and leg, Clarke plays the line with soft hands and it goes off the outer half to the off side.;
86.5;4;Welegedara to Clarke, FOUR runs Randiv dives over the ball at covers and Clarke picks up four. Over-pitched outside off at an amiable speed, and Clarke shows it the maker's name. Lovely shot.;
86.4;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run back of a length outside off, Clarke lets it go. He's standing inside the crease now.;
86.3;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run another leave from Clarke, too short and wide of off stump to make him drive.;
86.2;?;Welegedara to Clarke, no run angled across outside off, Clarke lets it go.;
86.1;2;Welegedara to Clarke, 2 runs full from over the stumps on middle, Clarke places his front foot across and turns it around square. 120 kph that. Loose loosener. Even Indian fast bowlers bowl better looseners than that.;

Welegedara is on, with the old ball.
 Innings Start
That's the end of what's been a very good series, though the denouement was farcical today. Full marks to Australia for emerging trumps in these conditions. On behalf of the ESPNcricinfo gang, this is Nitin Sundar signing off. So long, and thanks for all the smart feedback. It was a pleasure!
The Warne-Murali Trophy is an unusual piece of silverware, or should I say woodware. It has two fists gripping balls, and since Murali was such a wristy practitioner, it is tough to say which hand is whose. Neither hand is particularly pudgy either!
Presentations time, then. Haroon Lorgat is one of the dignitaries. Wonder what he thinks of this pitch. Sangakkara gets a special memento for his 100th Test from Lorgat, and another one from the SSC. What a legend!
Clarke is up next to pick up the Warne-Muralitharan Trophy. "Very proud with the way we played this whose tour, the ODIs and the Tests. The new players have made most of their opportunities too, which is pleasing. We will take a lot of heart out of this series, but South Africa will be a completely different challenge."
Hussey is Man of the Match for the third time on the trot, and inevitably the Man of the Series too. What an accomplishment! "Its been a very tough series. South Africa is going to be another tough series and I look forward to it."
Dilshan: "I am happy with the way we played here, we came back strongly. We had a chance to win this one, but they played better cricket to save it and take the series. I am happy with the way Mathews and Thirimanne have come along. Also pleased with the way I found form here."
Mercy on us, the SL openers agree to call the game off at the first opportunity. Australia move to No. 4 in the ICC ratings and SL slip to 5th.
Jason: "Would have been nice to give Hussey the new ball. Never know, SL could have been 6 down already."
Valerio: "Either play to the finish or call the game off as soon as both sides agree they could not be bothered chasing a result. In this match that would have been around Lunch on Day 3. We all could have then moved on with our lives. Oh the frustration of these batting pitches." The game "went the distance" Valerio, so Chris Broad is going to wax eloquent about it in his report. Unlike the Galle wicket, which was a "disgrace".
1.6;?;Lyon to Thirimanne, no run another leave outside off, Lyon spins the last ball of the series sharply away from Thirimanne's leave.;

1.1;4;Lyon to Thirimanne, FOUR runs tossed up outside off, Thirimanne opens the face as he steers and gets it away through point for four.;

0.5;2;Copeland to NT Paranavitana, 2 runs Paranavitana guides another length ball into the covers for a couple.;
0.4;?;Copeland to NT Paranavitana, no run Paranavitana gets bat on it this time, pushing off the front foot towards point.;
0.3;?;Copeland to NT Paranavitana, no run beaten by a beauty outside off. Paranavitan feels for a ball that wobbles away off the seam and just eludes the outside edge.;
0.2;?;Copeland to NT Paranavitana, no run opens the face and guides a length ball towards point.;
0.1;?;Copeland to NT Paranavitana, no run gets this one on a better line, Paranavitana lets it go to Haddin.;
0.1;1w;Copeland to NT Paranavitana, 1 wide short and wide outside off and Dar calls it wide.;

Here we go for the fourth innings. What a thriller. Copeland has the ball. Can he pick a fiver? Three slips.
