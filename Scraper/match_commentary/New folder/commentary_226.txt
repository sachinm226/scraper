Data
5.57pm Warner faced the first ball of the innings. He did not budge until the last ball. He made 156 from 128 balls; the other eight Australian batsmen made 90 from 174 balls. Warner walks off to a standing ovation, he is congratulated by his captain.
The hosts were pinned down to 4 for 73, but Warner rode out the tough phase, and shifted gears in the slog overs. In the process, he raised his seventh ODI century of the year. Only Tendulkar has more centuries in a year than Warner.
David Warner, the man of the moment: It was one of those wickets that was two- paced (Your captain said it was one hell of a knock?). The odd one was skidding through. With a couple of wickets down, we had to knuckle down. The miles in the legs; that is what we do. I am ready to go and defend the target. I think 264 is enough.
Nate: "Three batsmen (Warner, Smith, head) have scored more than 70% of Australia's total runs this series. Warner and Smith alone have scored more than 55% of Aus's total runs. Take into account that Smith scored a duck today, and that's quite incredible!"
Jimmy: "Warner 13 4s and 4 6s. Rest of team - 4 4s. Remarkable. "

39.4;1w;Santner to Wade, 1 wide ooh, that was a loopy delivery drifting down leg. Not too far away from the leg stump and Wade cannot make contact as he tries to get it behind square. The wicketkeeper takes the bails off after collecting it but his foot was inside the crease. Called a wide;
39.3;?;Santner to Wade, no run good length ball on middle stump, Wade tucks it to the leg side;
39.2;?;Santner to Wade, no run floated and pushed across on a length outside off, blocked;
39.1;W;Santner to Head, OUT pre-meditated. Good delivery from Santner. Head moves across perhaps looking for an expansive shot through the off side. But Santner gets it to drift away from around the stumps and Head is far away from the line of the ball as a result. It does not turn much either, so he can't get anywhere close to it and the ball crashes into the stumps;Travis Head b Santner 37 (82m 70b 2x4 0x6) SR: 52.85;
38.6;1;Southee to Head, 1 run moves across to protect off-stump before steering it to third man;

37.3;1;Santner to Warner, 1 run tucked to the leg side;
37.2;4;Santner to Warner, FOUR runs oh, lovely shot. Gets it very fine and the ball goes away to the fine leg boundary. That's Warner's seventh ODI century. Only Tendulkar (nine in 1998) has more in a calendar year. Coming to the delivery, it was a length ball that didn't spin much. Warner tucks it off the pads and it seems like the ball would go to the short fine leg fielder. But he places it superbly and gets it very fine as the ball beats the short fine leg fielder who tries to chase it down;
37.1;1;Santner to Head, 1 run makes room to get close to the line of the ball before tucking it to deep square leg;

36.5;?;Southee to Warner, no run fuller ball outside off, driven to cover;
36.4;1;Southee to Head, 1 run fuller ball, driven firmly and rather uppishly towards mid-off. Head sets off for a quick single and the ball lands just in front of Williamson who fires in a throw at the non-striker's end. He misses but a direct hit would have seen the back of him;
36.3;?;Southee to Head, no run goes for a wild slog across the line to this fuller ball and gets comfortably beaten. It was a cross-seam delivery and he was probably done in by the lack of pace on that delivery;
36.2;?;Southee to Head, no run fuller ball a set of stumps outside off, Head shuffles across and squeezes out a drive to cover;
36.1;1;Southee to Warner, 1 run fuller ball on the fourth-stump channel, driven wide of mid-off for a quick single;

34.6;1;de Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run short ball, pulled to deep square leg;
34.5;4;de Grandhomme to Warner, FOUR runs oh, what a shot. That was unorthodox but so effective. It was a length ball outside off and Warner flat-bats it off the backfoot straight down the ground. Nigel Llon ghas to jump out of the way as the ball shoots past him and past the straight boundary;
34.4;1;de Grandhomme to Head, 1 run fuller outside off, driven to sweeper cover;
34.3;?;de Grandhomme to Head, no run short of a length outside off, punched off the backfoot to short cover;

33.6;?;Ferguson to Head, no run short of a length ball, Head inside-edges the pull to the pad and Ferguson darts forward on the follow-through to ensure there is no run;
33.5;2;Ferguson to Head, 2 runs great running. It was full and outside off. Head drilled it hard to mid-off but did not time it precisely. Williamson fires a throw at the non-striker's end as they scamper across for a quick sinlgle. Does not hit the stumps and there is no back-up as they take a quick second run and Head has to put in the dive to get back in the crease;
33.4;1;Ferguson to Warner, 1 run short ball, Warner swivels around with the pull to deep midwicket. Momentarily thinks of a second run but it went straight to the fielder there so they decide against it;
33.3;1;Ferguson to Head, 1 run very full and outside off, knocked powerfully down the ground to long-off;
33.2;?;Ferguson to Head, no run shuffles across and cuts this short and wide ball. But there is a point and a backward point. Too packed there and he can't pick the gap;

32.6;?;de Grandhomme to Head, no run fuller on middle and leg, flicked away to midwicket;
32.5;2;de Grandhomme to Head, 2 runs;
32.4;1;de Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run close run out chance at the striker's end. It was a short ball and Warner pulls it just wide of short fine leg. Trent boult does not send the best of throws at the striker's end or Travis Head could have been in trouble. It was Head's call and he makes it in the end;
32.3;1;de Grandhomme to Head, 1 run full ball, eased straight down the ground past the bowler who slides and sticks his hand out but can't stop it;
32.2;?;de Grandhomme to Head, no run short ball outside off, Head can't find the middle of the bat on the cut and the ball goes to cover;

31.4;?;Boult to Head, no run angling in from over the wicket, Head gets an inside edge on to his pads and the ball rolls away to the leg side;
31.3;4;Boult to Head, FOUR runs what a shot! Absolutely bludgeoned. You offer width at the pace outside off, it's going to go to the boundary nine out of 10 times. Head was struglging with his timing and wasn't able to find the middle of the bat. But that muct have felt good. Lays into the cut shot and the ball goes away to the square third man boundary;
31.2;1;Boult to Warner, 1 run gets an inside edge again and skews it to square leg this time;
31.1;4;Boult to Warner, FOUR runs lucky boundary, that. It wa sshort and wide outside off. Cross-seam delivery does not bounce as much as he would have liked and Warner gets a bottom edge that beats the diving wicketkeeper and races way to the fine leg boundary;

30.5;?;de Grandhomme to Warner, no run fuller ball outside off, pushed back to the bowler off the front foot;

28.4;1;de Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run eased down to long-on;

27.5;?;Ferguson to Head, no run short and wide, slapped hard to point;
27.4;3;Ferguson to Warner, 3 runs short ball juust around off, pulled away to cow corner. Two fielders - deep midwicket and long-on - give it a chase and converge on the ball. The former puts in the dive to just about pull it back before the ropes. They go upstairs to check and he seems to have done fine there;
27.3;1;Ferguson to Head, 1 run goes too hard at it and knocks this length ball outside off to mid-off;
27.2;?;Ferguson to Head, no run moves across early to cover his stumps. It's pre-meditated. The ball was wide and outside off. It's slower also and takes forever to get to Head who gets beaten as he attempts an awkward slap;
27.1;4;Ferguson to Head, FOUR runs short ball, Head lays into a pull shot and the ball races away between long-on and deep midwicket;
27.1;1w;Ferguson to Head, 1 wide bouncer from Ferguson, too high and called a wide;
26.6;2;de Grandhomme to Warner, 2 runs Warner comes on to the front foot to this short of a length ball and tries to punch it. Does so uppishly inciting cries of "catch it." But the ball lobs just over the leaping cover fielder and goes away to sweeper cover;

26.1;?;de Grandhomme to Warner, no run short of a length ball, angled in from around the stumps, worked to point;
25.6;?;Ferguson to Head, no run moves across to cover his stumps a tad too early. That perhaps cramped him slightly for room as he picks out point on the cut shot to this short of a length ball that is angled across outside off;
25.5;?;Ferguson to Head, no run short ball, Head tries to lean back and play the upper cut but the bounce is too steep and he is beaten;
25.4;1;Ferguson to Warner, 1 run short of a length, tucked off the pads through square leg;

23.4;1;Southee to Head, 1 run that's better. Does not go at it with hard hands. Just waits for this ball outside off and opens his bat face late to run it down towards third man;

Here is Ferguson. He can set the speedgun on fire: at his best he can hit 150ks. But pace can also be your enemy. He conceded 73 on Sunday, the most by a NZ bowleron ODI debut
 Innings Start
That's it from us for this game then. Australia have been clinical with bat and ball throughout the series and deservedly end with a 3-0 scoreline that is a fairly accurate representation of the teams' performances. Meanwhile, India are going strong in their reply to England's 400 in the fourth Test in Mumbai. Just about half an hour left in the day, so stay tuned. Until next time!
Steven Smith - The catch wasn't a bad one. It was a nice way to finish. We have put up a pretty complete performance in all three games. We needed to improve after South Africa. The bowlers put in good performances. The guys from the top four going and getting hundreds and bowers sticking to plans has helped us turn it around. All three quicks bowled beautifully throughout the series. It was good to see Pat Cummins coming back and bowling fast and Starc too is returning after a while.
Kane Williamson - There has been a player in the Aussie side who has contributed in every game. Pretty disappointing. We did want to show signs of improvement, which is why today's performance was especially disappointing. We would have had to bat well to chase down 264, but it was pretty gettable. I don't think we were smart enough with the bat today. Australia thoroughly deserved to win. I would also like to thank the support the Kiwis have had. We would definitely like to improve and we now look forward to the return series.
Warner - It's a team performance. Credit to the bowlers for coming out and executing the plans. Us as batsmen, we had to relay the message and they did extremely well. My first coach of cricket until I was about 16 or 17 passed away, my condolences to his family. I would like to hope my form is getting better, but I need to keep hitting the nets and work harder.
David Warner is the Man of the Match and the Man of the Series.
So the final assessment reads like this - David Warner - 156; New Zealand - 147. Little else needs to be said. Australia complete a 3-0 sweep, and given how rough the last few months have been, this win must taste especially sweet. David Warner made all the difference between the two sides. On a pitch where the rest of Australia and all of New Zealand's batsmen struggled, Warner was on a different plane and struck at 121.87. Seventh ODI century of the year, second only to Tendulkar's nine in 1998 as far as most ODI centuries in a calendar year go. Unfortunately, he will not get a chance to try and break that record as Australia are done with ODIs for the year. But what a way to finish off 2016!
Pat Cummins - Absolutely, it was actually a little tougher today. David Warner played an unbelievable innings and it feels great to finish 3-0. Can't wait to get out there and bowl a few deliveries. I think on a wicket like this, it's a bit slow and there is not going to be much boundaries, so we had to stop the singles, which is something we pride ourselves in doing. It seems like I am learning something every game. Each week is different and it feels great.
Travis Head - Fantastic. Great opportunity, the last three games. We've played fantastically, especially after the last couple of months we've had, it feels great to win. I feel in good touch. Probably did not sum up the conditions as well as I would have liked to. It was a slow wicket. Happy that I was able to help win the game with the ball as well.
Geoff Hoar: "What another disappointing batting performance, yet another display of block bash batting with no attempt to rotate strike or play themselves in and build partnerships. Can we clone more Kane Williamsons and get an Aussie batting coach?"
36.1;W;Cummins to Boult, OUT oh, what a way to finish! It's Smith again. Took a stunner in the previous game. This one's as good if not better than the one in the previous ODI. He dived to his left on that occasion; this time, flings himself full-length to his right to snaffle a blinder at second slip. It was a slower back of a length ball from Cummins and Boult backs away and looks to open the face of his bat to steer it. Gets himself into an awkward position and skews it off a healthy outside edge;Trent Boult c Smith b Cummins 1 (13m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 14.28;
35.6;1;Faulkner to Boult, 1 run full and on the pads, Boult backs away and whips it to midwicket;

35.4;1;Faulkner to Ferguson, 1 run short of a length, tucked with the inward angle to fine leg;
35.3;?;Faulkner to Ferguson, no run fuller ball, driven uppishly to covers and it drops short of the fielder there;

35.1;?;Faulkner to Ferguson, no run back-of-the-hand slower ball that's angled across on a length outside off, Ferguson tries to cut and misses;
34.6;?;Starc to Boult, no run fuller ball, Boult awkwardly keeps it out to covers. Again, no feet;
34.5;?;Starc to Boult, no run yorker on the stumps, Boult jams his bat down and squeezes it out. The bat face opens as it makes contact with the ball and it goes to the off side;

34.3;1;Starc to Ferguson, 1 run sprayed down leg, clipped away to fine leg;
34.2;?;Starc to Ferguson, no run fuller ball, angled in on middle from around the wicket, pushed to mid-on;
34.1;?;Starc to Ferguson, no run fuller ball, chips the drive to cover-point where Cummins dives forward and takes it on the bounce;
33.6;?;Faulkner to Boult, no run very full ball outside off, squeezed out to cover;
33.5;1;Faulkner to Ferguson, 1 run runs it down to third man with an open face;
33.4;W;Faulkner to Southee, OUT Southee's chancy stay comes to and end with a miscue to extra cover. It was the slower ball and Southee was forward looking for a big hit over long-off. The lack of pace means he does not get the timing right and he skews it off the high end of the bat to Warner who settles under it at extra cover;Tim Southee c Warner b Faulkner 4 (23m 14b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57;
33.3;1;Faulkner to Ferguson, 1 run short of a length ball, back-of-the-hand slower variation. Ferguson dabs it uppishly into the vacant region around forward short leg;

33.1;?;Faulkner to Southee, no run comes down the track and looks to slog but the bowler follows him by firing it on leg stump channel and Southee ends up getting cramped for room as he makes no contact;
32.6;?;Starc to Ferguson, no run fuller ball outside off, swing and a miss from the batsman;
32.5;?;Starc to Ferguson, no run fullish ball outside off. Ferguson awkwardly shuffles across and keeps it out off the backfoot;
32.4;?;Starc to Ferguson, no run low full toss just inches outside off. Ferguson uncomfortably shifts back in his crease and the ball shoots past the outside edge;
32.3;?;Starc to Ferguson, no run full and wide, Ferguson backed away and took himself well outside the line of the ball. Can't make any contact;
32.2;?;Starc to Ferguson, no run Smith claims a catch at slips and it's not given. It certainly carried to Smith at second slip who dives forward and takes it. It was a short ball and Southee was trying to drop his wrists and back away. But the ball goes off the back glove, on to the forearm and lobs towards Smith. Australia review it and replays show that the back hand had come off at the point of contact, so the on-field decision stays;
32.1;?;Starc to Ferguson, no run fuller ball, angling in on the stumps from outside off, defended;
31.6;2;Faulkner to Southee, 2 runs comes down the track early again and the ball follows him which aids Southee as he lofts it over the on side with the angle. Does not get enough on it though and the ball is fielded at deep midwicket;
31.5;?;Faulkner to Southee, no run short of a length, defended into the leg side;
31.4;?;Faulkner to Southee, no run comes down the track again and goes for a wild slog but it's a length ball and the back-of-the-hand slower one which Southee does not pick and he gets beaten;
31.3;?;Faulkner to Southee, no run comes down the track early and the bowler adjusts by shortening his length. Southee is forced to steer it to point;

31.1;?;Faulkner to Southee, no run good length, angling in from outside off, Southee skips down a step and knocks it back to the bowler;
30.6;W;Starc to Santner, OUT not quite a yorker, very full and reverses in, Santner plays down the wrong line, and is beaten for pace too. Trapped in front of middle;Mitchell Santner lbw b Starc 15 (25m 21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 71.42;

28.4;?;Starc to Southee, no run;
28.3;?;Starc to Southee, no run edged, but does not carry to Wade. Full, angled in, swings away, opens Southee up. He wafts and nicks it. Wade dives to his right, but the ball drops in front of him;
28.2;W;Starc to Munro, OUT rip-roaring reverse-swinging yorker. Late inward shape for the fast bowler. Clatters into the leg stump. Every time Smith wants to break the stand, he turns to Starc, and his bowler delivers. Munro attempts a whip or a drive, and is beaten for pace. The ball shot through even before the left-hander could bring his bat down;Colin Munro b Starc 20 (53m 38b 1x4 0x6) SR: 52.63;

24.5;?;Hazlewood to Santner, no run good length and Hazlewood runs this one past the outside edge;
24.4;W;Hazlewood to de Grandhomme, OUT Head probably was late to pick up the ball. He runs in from deep square leg, dives forward, and pouches it. It jams the fingers under the ball; Head clings onto it nevertheless. Clean catch. NZ six down and sinking. Dug in short and outside off, De Grandhomme swivels on the back foot. Pulls and miscues it to the fielder;Colin de Grandhomme c Head b Hazlewood 11 (14m 10b 0x4 1x6) SR: 110;

21.5;W;Head to Watling, OUT an appeal for lbw, not given. Did it straighten enough? It may have pitched outside leg. Smith and Head converge and challenge the on-field call. RTS does not detect an inside edge. It pitched in line, hitting off stump. Three reds flash on the big screen. Umpire Llong's on-field call is reversed. Watling attempted to sweep again, but made no contact this time;BJ Watling lbw b Head 8 (17m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 61.53;

18.5;?;Starc to Munro, no run low full-toss, tails in, jammed out to midwicket;
18.4;?;Starc to Munro, no run half-volley outside off, leans forward and drills it away. It seemed destined to race to the boundary... until Head dived full-length to his right to stop the ball at extra cover;

17.1;1;Head to Munro, 1 run darted in, chopped from the stumps to backward point;
16.6;W;Starc to Nicholls, OUT oh, gone. That's the perfect yorker. There aren't too many bowlers in world cricket today who bowl that delivery better than Starc. It was an attacking line and on the stumps. Nicholls was looking to bring his bat down to squeeze it out but the ball swings in late to beat the bat and rattle leg stump;Henry Nicholls b Starc 3 (16m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 27.27;
16.5;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run good length ball outside off, defended;

15.3;1;Head to Munro, 1 run good length ball, Munro allows himself some room before slapping it away to sweeper cover;
15.2;?;Head to Munro, no run punched off the backfoot straight back to the bowler;
15.1;W;Head to Guptill, OUT oh, what a catch! It's Bailey this time. Didn't fling himself full length like Smith in the previous match, but it was a remarkable catch nonetheless and very tough. It was fuller outside and Guptill could not keep his drive along the ground. The ball lobs over the head of Bailey at short cover and he leaps up to snaffle it. Timed his jump to perfection and his back formed an almost uncomfortable arch as he took it. Guptill is livid. New Zealand now need to be careful;Martin Guptill c Bailey b Head 34 (66m 40b 3x4 0x6) SR: 85;
14.6;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run shifts across to protect his off-stump before blocking this length ball off the backfoot into the off side;

14.2;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run length ball outside off, Guptill knocks it to mid-on;
14.1;4;Cummins to Guptill, FOUR runs Smith tries to pull off a repeat of the blinder he snaffled in the previous match but this time does not manage to do it. It was a short ball and Guptill flays it hard past Smith who is diving to his right but can't get his hands to it;
13.6;W;Faulkner to Williamson, OUT and the on-field decision stays. It was a short of good length ball that was angling. Williamson moved across to get outside the line of the ball and flick it away to the leg side. But he perhaps moved away too much and ended up playing around the pad and the ball hits the front pad. Nigel Llong raised his finger but Williamson reviews it. Only way this can get overturned is if the angle takes it down leg. It is quite sharp but it seems as though it will be umpire's call. In fact, it's hitting the inside of the leg stump;Kane Williamson lbw b Faulkner 13 (21m 12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 108.33;
13.5;1;Faulkner to Guptill, 1 run back of a length ball outside off, punched easily from the crease to sweeper cover;

12.4;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run good length on off, Guptill comes on to the front foot and defends late and the ball goes to gully;
12.3;4;Cummins to Guptill, FOUR runs short of a length and angling in, Guptill tucks off the hips to deep fine leg;
12.2;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run short ball, well-deceived slower ball. Guptill is through with the pull shot much earlier than earlier and the ball goes to the wicketkeeper;
12.1;1;Cummins to Williamson, 1 run width on offer outside off, Williamson waits for it and opens the face of his bat to guide it to third man;
11.6;1;Faulkner to Williamson, 1 run fuller ball, again defends it very late and drops it at the crease as the ball goes behind the stumps. The wicketkeeper has to move across slightly, towards gully, to collect it and that gives them enough time to take a quick single;
11.5;4;Faulkner to Williamson, FOUR runs very full ball outside off, Williamson has to reach out for it but does well to drive it square of the wicket, picks the gap between cover-point and backward point;

10.4;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run fuller outside off, driven to cover;
10.3;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run good length on the fourth stump channel, Williamson defends it very late off the front foot, so late that the ball lands right on the crease and goes behind the stumps, to the right of the wicketkeeper;
10.2;4;Cummins to Williamson, FOUR runs beautiful placement. It was full and on the pads. There is enough pace on that delivery and all Williamson has to do is find the gap which he does as he nudges the ball wide of mid-on;
10.1;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run short of a length outside off, Williamson punches it square of the wicket off the front foot and what a save at backward point. George bailey flings himself to his left with both hands outstretched;
10.1;1w;Cummins to Williamson, 1 wide short ball, Williamson ducks and it's too high, so called a wide;
9.6;?;Faulkner to Guptill, no run good length outside off, blocked into the off side;

8.6;W;Cummins to Latham, OUT oh, dear! Picks out square leg on the flick. It was a good length ball and Latham used the angle well to flick it. Timed it to perfection but could not place it as he would have liked. The ball goes straight to Faulkner at square leg. Simple catch and Latham's promising innings comes to an end;Tom Latham c Faulkner b Cummins 28 (38m 36b 3x4 0x6) SR: 77.77;
8.5;?;Cummins to Latham, no run well-directed short ball that forces Latham to lean back and drop his wrists as the ball is left alone in the channel just outside off;

8.1;?;Cummins to Latham, no run short of a length and angled across, Latham's eyes light up on seeing the width on that delivery as he slaps but the ball goes to point;

7.2;?;Hazlewood to Latham, no run good length, outside off blocked;

6.6;1;Cummins to Guptill, 1 run fuller ball, pushed to mid-on for a sharp single;
6.5;2;Cummins to Guptill, 2 runs length ball, angling in on the pads, tucked to midwicket;
6.4;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run back of a length outside off, Guptill gets on top of that and punches elegantly off the backfoot but straight to cover;
6.3;?;Cummins to Guptill, no run short of good length outside off, Guptill blocks from the crease and the ball goes off the inside part of the bat to the right of the bowler;
