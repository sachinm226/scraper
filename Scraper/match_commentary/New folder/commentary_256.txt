3:00pmThe departing Australia captain Michael Clarke called for more fight and grit from his team. And the soon-to-be captain Steven Smith led the visitors with his 11th Test century. Starc then clattered some blows in a rapid fifty to push his side onward, despite a late middle-order muddle. Time for a quick changeover..
Deano: "332-3 to 481 all out? Interesting times ahead for the batsmen now....."

Australia have been bowled out for 481 while Finn finishes with three wickets;Peter Siddle c Lyth b Finn 1 (20m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 11.11;

124.5;?;Stokes to Lyon, no run back of a length and swerves back in, Lyon keeps back and scoops it in the air. Well wide of the bowler and well in front of mid-on. Stokes drops to his knees.;

121.1;W;Finn to Smith, OUT Smith back away, opens up his stance to thrash through point - and gets a thick bottom edge on to his stumps!

105.5;W;Ali to Johnson, OUT bowled'em. Johnson gone for a duck. Tossed up, drifts in, straightens past the outside edge to tilt the middle stump back. And that is lunch on the second day. Johnson played down the wrong line and paid the penalty..;Mitchell Johnson b Ali 0 (1m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

93.1;1nb;Finn to Smith, (no ball) Two wickets in two balls for England. Finn has overstepped, again. Big, big, no-ball. 4-5 inches over the line. He has to wait for his 100th Test wicket. This was slung short and miles wide outside off, Smith slashes, has a big whoosh at it and nicks it behind to the keeper, who moves to his right to pouch it. Finn is absolutely gutted. He has only himself to blame, though. It happened in the previous Test at Trent Bridge too;
92.6;W;Stokes to Voges, OUT pinned him, superb inswinger from Stokes! That looked very good and Dharmasena doesn't think long about it... Voges decides to review, however, perhaps more due to the prospect of an Ashes hundred on the horizon than a firm conviction of injustice. Umpire Ravi has a quick look at the replays and decides that was plumb, up goes the finger again and England have their breakthrough on the stroke of the hour;Adam Voges lbw b Stokes 76 (175m 130b 12x4 0x6) SR: 58.46;

Here's Tamino: "So if England win this Test, overtake Australia in the Test rankings and become the first English team to win an Ashes series 4-1 at home they will say 'meh, doesn't mean much, it was only a dead rubber'? Don't think so."
 Innings Start
11.40am: Pace does the job for Australia, England concede a 332-run advantage and have been asked to follow on. Michael Clarke gives his players a quick talking to, they'll be back out in 10 to begin their pursuit of another 10 wickets and a sign-off victory for their captain. Don't go anywhere - all signs point to another three-day Test!
"So, England to score 600 and win the game?" You'll get good odds on that, Alex.
Dan has a different theory: "Clark declared because he wants to hit the winning runs."
48.4;W;Johnson to Ali, OUT length outside off, Moeen pushes at it and nicks to the keeper! Johnson has cleaned up, two in two balls and Moeen's resistance is also ended;Moeen Ali c ?Nevill b Johnson 30 (85m 61b 6x4 0x6) SR: 49.18;
48.3;W;Johnson to Wood, OUT another bumper, Wood takes on the hook... and spoons it to midwicket! That's his merry hit over, done for pace and a top edge looped gently towards the edge of the square.

47.3;4;Lyon to Ali, FOUR runs tossed up, not so much footwork but Moeen does swing a clean blade through the line and gets it fine of mid-on, despite the cry of "catch!";

24.4;W;Marsh to Root, OUT beaten playing back to a shortish ball, Marsh and the keeper go up - they're convinced but Dharmasena isn't. Clarke, who also didn't react, decides to go with his players and calls for a review. This is going to be interesting, there's no visible edge but seems to be a sound; Hot Spot shows nothing, but there is a feather on Snicko. Is that conclusive evidence? Umpire Ravi is taking his time... The bat was away from the body, so there's nothing else the sound can be from, so after several replays Ravi eventually decides that the decision can be overturned and Root is out;Joe Root c ?Nevill b Marsh 6 (59m 39b 1x4 0x6) SR: 15.38;

23.3;W;Siddle to Bell, OUT bowled him, clips the off bail with a corking delivery! This has been an exacting spell from Siddle, full of subtlety and skill, he found the perfect length to trouble the top of off, got the ball to hold down the line and beat Bell's defensive push - a real bail-trimmer.

12.2;W;Siddle to Lyth, OUT short again and Lyth plops a catch into the hands of mid-on! Oh dear... Chances are fast running out for Lyth to convince, he latched on to what was little more than a long hop but could only spoon it gently into the leg side, where both mid-on and midwicket were waiting.

7.1;W;Lyon to Cook, OUT Cook is bowled. Top, top ball from Lyon. He gives this more air, gets it to drift it, grip in the pitch and turn away past the jittery defence to clip the top of off after pitching on middle and leg. And that is tea;Alastair Cook b Lyon 22 (30m 21b 4x4 0x6) SR: 104.76;

 Innings Start
4.15pm: For the second time in his career as England captain, Alastair Cook lifts the little (replica) urn above his head, as the champagne corks go flying. Joe Root has got the crystal version and the players are going for a lap of the ground, someone is singing "Jerusalem" again... Well, it's had its bathetic moments but England can now enjoy the finale. I'm sure there'll be a few beers in the rooms with both sets of players now, too. Michael Clarke and Chris Rogers can toast Test careers that were nearly great and very good respectively and hopefully no one will require a toilet break in the middle. You can read about how Australia farewelled them with victory, despite the English weather, in David Hopps' report, then take a look at the statistics of what has been a head-scratching series, in which Australia finished with three of the top four run-scorers and four of the top five wicket-takers. There will be the usual video gems to look out for and, if you've had your Ashes fill, then perhaps you'd like to read about another retiring great over in Colombo. We've had the usual fun and games, ably assisted by your witty and insightful contributions - give it a week or so and we'll be back with the limited-overs stuff. For now, from Deiva and myself, as well as Gnasher, Karthik, Miller and the rest, it's goodbye. Ta ra!
3.45pm: The stage has been erected and it's time for the presentations. Clear skies above The Oval as England prepare to receive the cherry atop their Ashes cake... But first, the Player of the Match is Steven Smith: "Yeah, it was [tough batting], coming into this game there was a lot to play for for us, Michael in his last Test. Great to get some runs and the bowlers back it up as well. Always going to be tough, there were a couple of wickets that were a bit spicy and it was quite hard work. I like batting in London, it suits me good. It's been disappointing but credit to England they played some really good cricket throughout this series. Michael been a great captain to play under these last two years and I've certainly leaned a lot off os him. As Test [players we judge ourselves most on Ashes series, we've got a lot of cricket to play before then, a few new players to come in.
Chris Rogers is named as Australia's man of the Series: "Yeah, I've never been up here so it's pretty special. It's nice to win this last Test and be a part of Michael's last Test as well. Well, I think I've played most in England and Australia so I probably had that advantage. My first series back in 2013 was tough, the wickets have been tricky at times, so it's something to be proud of. I'm a proud Australian but it's fitting I get to finish up over here, England's been particularly good to me and I've had a lot of support, so thank you very much. Playing cricket for a living isn't the toughest life, I've always enjoyed it and getting this late opportunity, I've just tried to make the most of it. Thanks to the Aussie guys for making me feel so welcome.
Joe Root is England's Man of the Series and the winner of the Compton-Miller medal: "Yeah, credit to Australia, they outplayed us in this game, we've got to take that on the chin but we can celebrate now. I think the guys prepared well for this Test match, we had a poor couple of hours a couple of days ago, Australia being the good side they are didn't let us back in the game. [Importance of hundreds] Credit to the whole squad, it's been a team performance and it's been great to be part of. Tonight will be hard to beat, all of it's been great, I love spending time with the guys and hope for more good times going forward. [No1 batsman] I think I need to score more runs than I did in this match, that comes with playing for England and playing international cricket. I'll just keep doing what I've done and trying to improve."
Australia captain Michael Clarke: "After the last Test, couldn't have gone any better, the hard work the guys have put in. Credit to Alastair and his team, they've deserved the win but we're glad to have come out in this match and put in a performance. We're disappointed with how the series went but we came out and showed some of our best. [Crowd response] They used to boo me but I haven't been scoring any runs... The fans are such a great part of playing this game. Probably my favourite tour was in 2005, it introduced me to how tough it is. I've had a wonderful time touring here, hopefully I can now come back and have a holiday. I came into a great Australian team, my first 20 or 30 Test match, those guys mentored me and hopefully I've managed to pass some of that on. Enjoy every single moment, I'm blessed to have played for Australia as much as I have, it's an honour to captain your country. But this isn't my stage, congratulations to Alastair and the England team."
England captain Alastair Cook: "It's been an interesting Test match, probably both sides have been a little bit off in terms of intensity, credit to Australia and their character to bounce back. You see how strong Australia were here, so to have beaten them three times - we played some really good cricket at times, the crowds have been absolutely amazing, so thanks to everyone. I knew this was a talent group of players, I think being huge underdogs at the start helped us, it allowed us to go and play with freedom. It's an amazing achievement to beat this Australia side, so it has to rank right up there. It's been strange at times, two-day Test matches, but very pleasing. [Young team?] Learning the hard game of test cricket as young players, it's good for the future. It's exciting, there'll be tough times but look forward to grabbing those moments in the future."
3.30pm: Michael Clarke heads off, through another guard of honour, for the last time in international cricket. Australia had a whip round to provide a consolation victory - England chipped in too - as the captain prepares for retirement. Chris Rogers also leaves the pitch in his baggy green for the last time. The players shake hands on the stairs up to the Oval dressing rooms; England were roundly trounced here but take the series 3-2 and regain the Ashes. For the fifth Test running, the final day is superfluous (I've still got that ticket for sale, if anyone wants it).
Ian Ward has grabbed the two retirees, Pup and Buck: "Both Chris and I are sick of the attention, to be honest, every time we walked out on the field. This week wasn't about us, it was about showing our fight as a team, we're proud of the result. The result of the series was done, England deserve a lot of credit, but this was nice to win. Been an amazing journey, you cherish every single Test but, us two old boys, our time is up."
"I don't normally get emotional but it's a sad day," says Rogers. "It's been a fantastic journey and a privilege. I'm still angry with the skip about that [fielding at short leg], I've been hit in the head enough. I'll miss the moments like this, the few hours we have left today, I'll cherish every moment."
So, England failed to win four Tests in a home Ashes series for the first time (which is probably a fair reflection of their ability as a team), and Australia extended their run of failure in England that goes back to 2001. Clarke failed to score fifty, Alastair Cook failed to score a hundred (he still doesn't have an Ashes one at home). Both sides failed to compete, though still served up a weirdly enthralling series. At the end of it all, as Samuel Beckett might say, it was England that managed to fail better.
