Data
West Indies, thanks to that late surge by Sammy and Deonarine, have reached a competitive total. But Australia will back themselves to chase it. An unblemished summer is a big enough incentive to prevent any slip-ups. Lets see how they manage. Join us in a bit.
19.6;6;Christian to Sammy, SIX runs Christian's figures have been damaged in this last over, gifts Sammy a length ball, he gets under it and deposits it miles over the ropes over long-on;

19.3;2;Christian to Deonarine, 2 runs short on the off, swats it in the direction of long-on, Harris takes a while to get to it, they run back for the second, though a direct hit at the striker's end would have found the batsman short;

Mukundh sends us our first feedback of the day: "Bumped into some of the aussie cricket team at the food court downstairs my office in sydney buying sandwiches and coffee - they were living in the hotel across the road. surprised that they were standing in queue with a bunch of us office workers and no one mobbed them or even asked for pics or autographs. wonder what would have happened to an indian team player buying lunch at a sandwich store on the afternoon of a cricket match in india."

Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the second Twenty20 international between West Indies and Australia being played in Sydney. West Indies have won the toss and opted to bat in a game they need to win to deprive Australia of an unbeaten summer. We'll get you the teams in a bit; in the meantime, do read the preview to this match.
 Innings Start
A ruthless batting display from Australia has won them this game with 50 balls to spare. Warner was outstanding, and Watson took the lead after his departure to hasten Australia's victory. West Indies offered some fight in the Tests, but wilted after that to end the tour on a disappointing note. Thanks for tuning in for our coverage right through the summer. We hope you enjoyed it.
