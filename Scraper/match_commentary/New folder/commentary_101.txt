12.55pm Welcome back, folks. Interesting morning. High on fun, low on quality. How good is 346? Well, it's worth staying that three times in their last seven Test overseas England have scored 400+ on first innings and still lost by an innings. So, on that thought...
12.20pm: England's last pair walk off, along with the Australia players - that will be lunch, slightly early since the innings is at an end. England's last four wickets managed to add 95 (aided by a couple of howling drops), which goes against the grain of the series, but their total of 346 still looks short on a very sound batting surface. Have they got it in them to shake up Australia and make things interesting? Can they dismiss Steve Smith before he gets to three figures? Well, we'll get an inkling when the teams return in 40 minutes, when Gnasher will be back in the comms seat
112.3;W;Cummins to Anderson, OUT and it ends in a run-out! Anderson fended the ball around the corner and wanted to get up the other end, Crane was slow to react, I think, and was barely in the frame as Bancroft stepped across from short leg to receive the throw and break the stumps;Mason Crane run out (Marsh/Bancroft) 4 (18m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;

108.4;W;Cummins to Tom Curran, OUT hammered in at the body, 88mph and Curran steers it straight into the hands of short leg! Simple enough, when it works... Bancroft gratefully accepts a dolly of a catch and Curran walks off shaking his head after a spirited innings;Tom Curran c Bancroft b Cummins 39 (90m 65b 6x4 0x6) SR: 60;

102.5;?;Cummins to Broad, no run back of a length, Broad jabs it down to short leg... just short of the fingertips! Bancroft stayed low but the ball just died on him, Broad camping in the crease and nearly getting a first-baller!;
102.4;W;Cummins to Ali, OUT snorting short ball, Moeen gloves to the keeper! He rarely looked comfortable out there and now he walks, the Australia fielders knew he'd got something on it, third wicket for Cummins... Was just the right height to get Moeen fending at it in self-preservation and there was a flick of glove as it steamed through;Moeen Ali c ?Paine b Cummins 30 (91m 58b 2x4 0x6) SR: 51.72;

98.2;?;Cummins to Tom Curran, no run a bounce over leg stump;
98.1;1;Cummins to Ali, 1 run dropped! And that's a clanger. What is going on? A short ball from round the wicket, Moeen gets a top edge as he pulls. It's a dolly as Hazlewood comes round from mid-on and he doesn't even get a hand on it. Extraordinary. Can barely explain how he missed that;
97.6;?;Lyon to Tom Curran, no run looking to turn this to the leg side, gets an inside edge into his pad but falls short of boot hill;

96.3;2;Hazlewood to Ali, 2 runs punches through the line of a good length delivery and sends it straight of mid-off, was in the air but quite safe;
96.2;1;Hazlewood to Tom Curran, 1 run he hasn't got much idea about this one! Takes his eyes off a short ball and flaps it down to long leg as as he also tries to duck;
96.1;1;Hazlewood to Ali, 1 run short of a length on leg stump, neatly pulled off the deep to deep square;
95.6;?;Lyon to Tom Curran, no run what's happened here? Curran has played back and defended a shorter delivery. Just has to watch it doesn't spin back towards the stumps. Paine walks from behind the stumps, picks up the ball and knocks off a bail and questions whether Curran had walked out of his ground. A moment of confusion, but Curran was very safe;
95.5;?;Lyon to Tom Curran, no run stays in the crease, pads this one away as it spins in at him from a straighter line;

93.6;?;Lyon to Ali, no run comes down on off stump and works from outside off to mid-on;

91.4;?;Lyon to Tom Curran, no run lovely bowling, classic off spin, a wideish line outside off, Curran lunges forward and this spins yet still beats the outside edge;

91.2;?;Lyon to Ali, no run defended on off stump;

88.5;4;Starc to Tom Curran, FOUR runs off the mark with a boundary, goes after a full and very wide delivery, square drives wide of point;
88.4;W;Starc to Malan, OUT what a catch! That's a stunner from Smith at second slip, he's dropped a few but that's a beauty. Short of a length outside off, Malan just pushes at it off the back foot, takes a thick edge and it looked for all the world like it would be out of Smith's reach but he went full stretch, low to his left and pulled off one of the great grabs;Dawid Malan c Smith b Starc 62 (249m 180b 6x4 0x6) SR: 34.44;

81.5;1;Hazlewood to Ali, 1 run full on leg stump, clipped in the air wide of mid-on...not entirely convincing;
81.4;W;Hazlewood to Bairstow, OUT edged and taken! Lovely bowling from Hazlewood, Australia have another! A huge one-two combo to the solar plexus, England go from controlling the ring to hanging on the ropes in a blink... Wide on the crease, fired in and then straightening off the seam to kiss the edge, the new ball thudding into the gloves to raucous celebrations around the SCG!;Jonny Bairstow c ?Paine b Hazlewood 5 (9m 7b 1x4 0x6) SR: 71.42;

80.6;1;Starc to Bairstow, 1 run searing yorker, thudding into the pads, Australia go up for the lbw... and Smith then asks for the review, though looks like it was heading down leg to me. In fact, Bairstow got a scrape of inside edge on it, too - so Australia will lose that review;

80.4;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run angled across full and tempting, Bairstow lets it go;

Mitchell Marsh threw himself forward to snaffle the chance, it was an excellent catch to leave Root tantalised in his search for a hundred in Australia... Starc gets the breakthrough and is mobbed by his team-mates. A late intervention to prevent England from fully claiming the day;Joe Root c Marsh b Starc 83 (225m 141b 8x4 0x6) SR: 58.86;
80.2;4;Starc to Root, FOUR runs nearly slayed by a drag-on! In fact, he's squeezed it fine for four... Late swing for Starc and Root was a touch late on it, Starc gives him a rueful grin;

79.6;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run full outside off and Malan steps out to drive, can't pierce the infield at cover;
79.5;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run in the channel, 81mph/133kph, no stroke;

Dave: "Hong Kong is a great time zone to watch cricket, England home series start at 6pm here and Ashes morning sessions can be viewed over breakfast, usually before work. Now it has it's own mini 6 day T20 league it's never been better!"
 Innings Start
Hello everyone, is this the final innings of the series? How much fight do England have in them? Will someone make me a cup of tea? A lot of questions
And now the declaration comes, with Australia 303 ahead. Smith calls them in, still an hour before tea and plenty of time to make some inroads... Crane doesn't quite rack up a double, but it's still the most expensive analysis by an England Test debutant. To say it's been bone-breaking work is probably an understatement, but now they will have to come out and try to salvage something with the bat. The not-so-smart money is on Australia to wrap up 4-0 some time between now and 6pm local time tomorrow; stick around, Gnasher will be back looking to draw first blood in 10

188.4;W;Ali to Starc, OUT attempts the big mow again, but this one goes straight up... and Vince swallows a steepler!

187.3;?;Broad to Starc, no run round the wicket, 86mph and thudding into the pads as Starc flicks at it, Broad asks the question but it's a fairly forlorn appeal - heading down leg;

It was Paine's call, maybe some tired running from Marsh but he picked up and released swiftly, completing the job that England's bowlers had strived to do for nearly 300 deliveries.

183.6;3;Broad to Marsh, 3 runs full on the pads and he clips this with business timing through midwicket, they'll get back for three here and that will be Marsh's 150, to the general appreciation of the crowd;
183.5;?;Broad to Marsh, no run tucks him up, Marsh brings the bat down at an angle and nearly plays on! Maybe came in a fraction and snuck through to hit the inside edge before bouncing over the stumps. Frustration for Broad, on a tour full of them;

168.3;?;Ali to Marsh, no run floated up on the stumps and blocked;
168.2;1;Ali to Marsh, 1 run tucked off the pads and Mitch calls his brother through, YJB scampers across and attempts to throw down the stumps at the other end - and he would have been gone with a direct hit!;

167.3;?;Anderson to Marsh, no run into the pads again, fuller length... same decision from the umpire! Root consults but elects not to gamble;
167.2;?;Anderson to Marsh, no run fired in straight and MMarsh plays around his front pad, Anderson implores Joel Wilson for the decision... but doesn't get it, and England decide not to review. Looked a fraction leg side;

165.2;4;Anderson to Marsh, FOUR runs excellent line, draws the outside edge, but it perfectly bisects first and second slip and flashes to the rope! Root was a little closer at second but couldn't quite get a mitt on it;
165.1;?;Anderson to Marsh, no run tight line and defended coming across on off;
164.6;?;Crane to Marsh, no run loopy legbreak on off, he looks more comfortable bowling to right-handers... blocked;

163.4;?;Anderson to Marsh, no run touch fuller, angling in and blocked towards cover;

163.2;?;Anderson to Marsh, no run over the top of off, again he shows it a straight bat;
163.1;?;Anderson to Marsh, no run touch back of a length, 84mph and nipping back in as MMarsh jumps into line and blocks;

162.5;?;Crane to Marsh, no run MMarsh plants the front foot and defends doggedly;
162.4;2;Crane to Marsh, 2 runs pushes this one through, don't think it was a googly but the ball slides on to hit the inside edge and run through backward square leg... 500 on the board for Australia, with power to add plenty more;

161.1;?;Anderson to Marsh, no run over the wicket, angled towards the top of off and pushed defensively back down the pitch;
160.6;1;Crane to Marsh, 1 run pushed out wide of the off stump and there's room for SMarsh to swat a cut shot to the sweeper for one more;

160.1;?;Crane to Marsh, no run too full, leg side to the left-hander but he clips it into the body of short leg and Stoneman is then sharp enough to underarm the ball into the stumps - but SMarsh was back;
159.6;?;Ali to Marsh, no run leg-stump line, not much in the way of spin and it's nudged away;

157.5;4;Ali to Marsh, FOUR runs tossed up and here he comes, Marsh skips out and drives, finds the gap, it races away through the covers to the rope... Off comes the helmet, second hundred of the series for Marsh, celebrated with a man hug from his younger bro;

153.1;?;Tom Curran to Marsh, no run been given lbw! Mitchell Marsh reviews. Full and straight, tails back a little. Has he got a very little nick on it? There's the hint of a mark on Hot Spot. What about Snicko? Remember, given out on field. S Ravi has decided there's enough to overturn.;
