Data
That's a typically confident declaration, 8 for 442 and more than 20 overs left in the day. It's also a jutted jaw in the direction of Joe Root, who chose to put Australia in yesterday. England need to summon something in response (maybe a Balrog?) if this isn't going to be repeatedly mentioned to the (former) captain in 20 years time...
They'll be out there batting in 10 minutes. While we wait, please, speak your brains:
Andrew Jennings: "Englands management need to stop messing about with the Stokes issue, and bring him back for the third test, and also give Crane his chance. Ali and Woakes have been very disappointing"
Mustafa Moudi: "England's Bowling Report Card So Far: 3 Innings, 943 Runs, 18 Wickets with an Average of 52.39 and S/R of 109.83 !!"
Gary: "So Overton went for just over a ton!"
Andrew: "Seeing those "7 last overseas tests" stats make me wonder what the English statisticians look at when advising Root to bowl first "

148.5;?;Broad to Marsh, no run switches over the wicket, full and wide and plopped into the covers;

148.3;4;Broad to Marsh, FOUR runs goes full, moral victory for the bowler but four more runs to Marsh, squeezed out down to fine leg;
148.2;4;Broad to Marsh, FOUR runs banged in, Marsh knows what to do with the short ball, crumped forcefully through midwicket and it beats the man in the deep for another salt-flavoured boundary;
148.1;?;Broad to Marsh, no run Broad manages to get one through wide of the stumps;
147.6;2;Overton to Lyon, 2 runs over the wicket, full and wide and this time he chops a couple through the covers. Needless to say, the crowd are loving this;
147.5;2;Overton to Lyon, 2 runs another filthy smear, top-edged over the keeper - couple more there! YJB hurtled after it but was never in the races for a catch;

147.3;?;Overton to Lyon, no run more short stuff, swing and a miss this time;

147.1;1;Overton to Marsh, 1 run touch short outside off and cross-batted over the covers, this time they do run one;
146.6;?;Broad to Lyon, no run pitched up to finish, not accurate enough and it's whupped through the covers... but there's a man out there and they decline the single;
146.5;?;Broad to Lyon, no run bumper, soaring over the flailing Lyon's horizontal bat;
146.4;?;Broad to Lyon, no run banged in, another filthy yahoo from Lyon. He's not much interested in getting into line;

81.6;?;Broad to Marsh, no run touch short and sliding down the leg side. Good first over from Broad, though;
81.5;?;Broad to Marsh, no run ooh, juicy stuff, superb length and he draws Marsh out, bowling from round the wicket and then shaping it away;
81.4;1;Broad to Paine, 1 run pitched up and worked through midwicket off the inside half of the bat to get going;
81.3;W;Broad to Handscomb, OUT pitched up, whirring in like an angry wasp off the pitch - and that's bang in front! England strike in the first over of the morning afternoon, Broad on the money and Handscomb once again nailed lbw deep in his crease... Perfect ball to a batsman trying to restart, hit on the back knee in front of off. Handscomb wisely decides not to review;Peter Handscomb lbw b Broad 36 (126m 86b 5x4 0x6) SR: 41.86;
81.2;?;Broad to Handscomb, no run nip-backer from Broad, touch short and it raps the thigh, caught on the crease but high;
81.1;?;Broad to Handscomb, no run back of a length, kisses the surfaces and skips through as Handscomb sits back and plays inside it;

80.5;?;Anderson to Handscomb, no run outside off, too wide to throw a bat at that one;
80.4;1;Anderson to Marsh, 1 run the inswinger to the left-hander this time. Clever bowling, but negotiated with aplomb. And a cheeky single to square leg too;

80.2;?;Anderson to Marsh, no run big swing on this occasion, but from outside off and heading wider;

144.6;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run bouncer, ducked;
144.5;1;Woakes to Marsh, 1 run spliced and dropped in the gully! Deary me, it's all going wrong for England, a sharp lifter from Woakes, Marsh can't get on top of it, Cook appeared to reach the ball low to his left, but Vince, diving to his right, from a wider gully, punched it out of his hand!;
144.4;1;Woakes to Cummins, 1 run flicked behind square for another single;
144.3;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run on the back foot, poked out to point;
144.2;2;Woakes to Cummins, 2 runs chopped down to third man, very cramped for room on the short ball, but somehow gets over his shot. Every closer to a richly deserved fifty;

143.6;?;Overton to Marsh, no run firmly punched to cover;
143.5;2;Overton to Marsh, 2 runs another slower ball, and a loopier full length this time! Marsh doesn't pick it at all and all but drags it onto his stumps. Cunning;

142.3;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run banged in short. No stroke offered;
142.2;1;Woakes to Marsh, 1 run short and wide. Smashed square. If Marsh is tightening up internally with his hundred looming, he isn't showing a jot of nerves up front;
142.1;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run outside off, left alone;
141.6;4;Ali to Cummins, FOUR runs biff! Does Cummins sense the chance for some quick kills before a late onslaught with the ball? This is utterly clobbered off a good length, travels fast and flat, dipping just inside the rope. England are getting a schooling in this session;
141.5;1;Ali to Marsh, 1 run another flicked single to the leg-side. He's closing in...;
141.4;4;Ali to Marsh, FOUR runs crunched! Too wide from Moeen, Marsh used his feet, and his confidence, to pound him majestically through the covers;

141.2;1;Ali to Cummins, 1 run forward to drive, into line once again;
141.1;4;Ali to Cummins, FOUR runs spanked high and effectively through the leg side! That's symptomatic of Moeen's lack of turn. Cummins trusted himself to heave across the line with impunity;

138.5;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run drilled into the covers, picks the gap in the inner ring but not the outer circle;
138.4;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run forward and blocked on the front foot. It's powderpuff from England at present;
138.3;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run another leave, but a much better ball, as this one bends back late to pass excruciatingly close to off stump;
138.2;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run an easy leave for Marsh as Woakes pulls his length back;
138.1;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run full length, attacking off stump, blocked to the off side;
137.6;?;Root to Cummins, no run flicked off the pads, was there bat on that? I think not, as Stoneman can't gather at short leg either way;
137.5;?;Root to Cummins, no run pushed back down the pitch;
137.4;?;Root to Cummins, no run down the leg side;
137.3;4;Root to Cummins, FOUR runs that is terrific! Making room, striding forward, launching his hands through the line, and easing a one-bounce four over the bowler's head;
137.2;2;Root to Cummins, 2 runs on the pads, flicked square;
137.1;?;Root to Cummins, no run reaching forward to block;
136.6;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run better ball, tight to off stump and climbing sharply;
136.5;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run wide again, but a sharper delivery, no contact on an attempted slash;
136.4;4;Woakes to Marsh, FOUR runs too short, too wide, too easy. Marsh lays bat on ball to guide a facile four through third man, and Australia march on;

136.2;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run squeezed to cover off the front foot;

135.4;?;Root to Cummins, no run forward and pushed down the track;
135.3;4;Root to Cummins, FOUR runs too short, that's a rank leg-stump long hop, and Cummins belts it behind square, sending Stoneman under the lid scurrying for cover;
135.2;?;Root to Cummins, no run solidly onto the front foot;
135.1;1;Root to Marsh, 1 run back of a length, whipped firmly through midwicket;
134.6;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run stabbed into the leg side again;
134.5;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run a judicious leave outside off, he's a very organised player;
134.4;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run better line, targetting the top of off, but back of a length. Oodles of time to line it up and block;
134.3;4;Woakes to Cummins, FOUR runs a crashing cut! That is supreme, Woakes serves up a short, wide offering, and gets utterly lambasted through the covers!;

134.1;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run cramped for room on leg stump, tucked off the hip;
133.6;1;Root to Cummins, 1 run forward and defended;
133.5;1;Root to Marsh, 1 run a tentative poke to a better-length ball, worked into the leg side off an inside edge, but it's enough to rotate the strike;

131.5;?;Ali to Marsh, no run shorter this time, whipped to short midwicket off the back foot;

130.4;3;Overton to Cummins, 3 runs pitched up and chipped, in the air but it clears Overton in his follow through, runs down the ground for another three to bring up the Australia 350;

125.4;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run lovely bowling, shaves the outside edge but falls short of Bairstow!

118.5;?;Broad to Cummins, no run short again, does well to get his gloves out of the way again... Dar signals the second above shoulder height for the over;
118.4;?;Broad to Cummins, no run banged in again, this is right over the crouching batsman, no danger;

111.6;?;Overton to Starc, no run full length, blocked to the off side;
111.5;1;Overton to Marsh, 1 run a sharp single to point! Starc was not ready to respond and Stoneman's shy misses the stumps by a whisker. He'd have been out by two feet!;

110.6;?;Ali to Starc, no run beaten by turn and bounce! Perfect length, leaps past the edge, and Bairstow can't gather either. Sharp delivery. Though Nathan Lyon is probably just as intrigued by that...;

110.4;?;Ali to Starc, no run another big stride, pushed back to the bowler;

107.2;?;Overton to Paine, no run bouncer, Paine ducks;
107.1;4;Overton to Paine, FOUR runs short and wide, and crashed gleefully over point! England can feel their hopes of a sub-400 total slipping away with every run now;

106.5;?;Ali to Marsh, no run looped up, defended down the track;

104.6;6;Ali to Paine, SIX runs yeehar! Have some of that! In the slot from Moeen, so Paine opened his shoulders, climbed through with the bottom hand, and tonked it high and handsome over wide long-on!;

104.2;?;Ali to Paine, no run standing tall on the back foot to defend;
104.1;2b;Ali to Paine, 2 byes sharp turn, but all the way down the leg side. A cluster of fielders round the bat, but Cook at leg slip can't gather that one;

usara sirimanne: "This innings from paine should put all the arguments against him to rest" Unless, of course, he's got a broken finger
 Innings Start
England wrapped up for 227, Craig Overton left on 41 not out... And the sight of David Warner and Cameron Bancroft sprinting from the field confirms that Australia will be batting again with a lead of 215. England have avoided the follow on but they look unlikely to avoid a thumping in Adelaide. We'll be back in a few minutes
"Bowl them out for 100 and we have a faint chance," mooches Matt. "Any more and series is gone."
76.1;W;Lyon to Anderson, OUT tossed up and Anderson is hit on the front leg trying to sweep - given! He reviews, which he might as well, hoping it's missing leg. But he hopes in vain, Hawk-Eye showing it to be smacking leg stump in the mush;James Anderson lbw b Lyon 0 (8m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

74.5;?;Lyon to Anderson, no run tossed up and there's spin again, past the edge as Anderson tries to force it off the back foot;
74.4;W;Lyon to Broad, OUT turn and bounce, takes the edge! Broad knew but Gaffaney's finger went up to make sure - Lyon does it again, good ball to any batsman, let alone a tailender keen to hang back; just kissed the edge as he closed the face and Paine followed it well with the gloves;Stuart Broad c ?Paine b Lyon 3 (23m 17b 0x4 0x6) SR: 17.64;

73.3;?;Cummins to Broad, no run short ball, taken by the leaping Bancroft at short leg... was there any bat on it? Superb catch diving to his left, but it was off the body;

68.1;?;Lyon to Overton, no run forward and blocked;
67.6;3;Starc to Overton, 3 runs fuller length, wide line, safe enough to put bat on ball with a firm push. Deep point gathers and wings in a rather wild shy. It's all England at the moment!;

66.2;1;Lyon to Woakes, 1 run flipped to leg with an urgent whirlwind of the arms;
66.1;?;Lyon to Woakes, no run over the wicket, appreciable turn and a bit of a flat-footed back-foot block from Woakes, who isn't keen on over-committing;
65.6;?;Starc to Overton, no run that's an absolute pearler. Left-arm line from over the wicket, pitching on off, drawing the stroke, holding its line, and somehow failing to snick the edge through to the keeper. Can't do much with those;
65.5;?;Starc to Overton, no run short, and leg-sided. A bit of a wasted delivery;
65.4;?;Starc to Overton, no run outside off, left alone (just about) as the ball nibbles off the seam;

63.6;?;Starc to Woakes, no run full and threatening, angled in from round the wicket. Well dug out;
63.5;4;Starc to Woakes, FOUR runs short, sharp, spliced, safe. Woakes was looking to punch that through point but it kept getting bigger on him. No matter, it's a boundary and the 50 stand;
63.4;2;Starc to Woakes, 2 runs back of a length, and that's a solid punch through the gap in the covers. A sensible stand brewing between these two;
63.3;?;Starc to Woakes, no run round the wicket, solidly blocked on middle stump. Starc swoops in his followthrough;
63.2;?;Starc to Woakes, no run blocked back down the pitch from a fuller length again;

62.3;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run uncomfortably forward, poking a back-of-a-length ball back to the bowler;

61.6;?;Cummins to Overton, no run short and sharp, but Overton is equal to the task, dropping the ball at his feet like Obama dropping the mic. Without anything resembling the context of a job done, of course;

61.4;?;Cummins to Overton, no run tentatively forward to defend;

60.6;3;Hazlewood to Overton, 3 runs much fuller, and that was the one that Woakes was waiting for, a calm punch to mid-on, and this is now the best partnership of the innings. Sound the *fightback-starts-here* klaxon!;

59.6;?;Cummins to Overton, no run fired in at the body and tapped away;
59.5;1;Cummins to Woakes, 1 run yikes, spooned over short leg! Cummins goes over the wicket, bangs in a cobra of a bumper, it homes in on Woakes who somehow manages to get it up and over the man in close;
59.4;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run short again and Woakes takes the bottom hand off as he steers it away to leg;
59.3;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run thud, thud, thud - that's the sound of England the middle of the pitch taking a beating. Woakes ducks;
59.2;1;Cummins to Overton, 1 run COverton shuffles across and flicks a single off his hip to get off strike;
59.2;1w;Cummins to Overton, 1 wide very short, more of a danger to airplanes flying over Adelaide, called wide on height;

58.6;1;Hazlewood to Overton, 1 run short and at the body but shovelled away behind square for a single;
58.5;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run more chin music - or, more accurately, top-of-the-block music - flying through a matter of millimetres from Overton's helmet as he jumps and ducks at the same time;

57.4;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run Woakes jumps back and across to defend;
57.3;1;Cummins to Overton, 1 run short ball, swung away powerfully down towards fine leg, Hazlewood has to run around to his left but does brilliantly to reel the ball in one handed as it bounced beyond the rope, dragging it back to prevent four;
57.2;?;Cummins to Overton, no run banged in, rising like the Kraken from the deep, Overton fends it in front of short leg, where Bancroft snaffles it and then underarms on to the stumps - but the bat was grounded;
57.1;1;Cummins to Woakes, 1 run short and Woakes rides it to steer one away square of the wicket;
56.6;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run banged in, 141kph and it's another beast of a ball to deal with, Overton manages to ride the bounce and drop it to earth;
56.5;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run oof, a genuine throat ball, Overton coming across and he has to take evasive action;
56.4;4;Hazlewood to Overton, FOUR runs short and wide and slapped through backward point, kept the ball down and there's no one out there to prevent four;
56.3;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run short, peppering the body, this nips back inside the bat and hits him on the thigh pad;

55.6;4;Starc to Woakes, FOUR runs short and flung wide this time and Woakes responds with a meaty swipe through cover point to pick up four - and take England past 150 in the process. Small victories;
55.5;?;Starc to Woakes, no run rapid bouncer, horrible for the batsman to deal with, Woakes leaps for his life and manages to block it safely down in front of his feet;
55.4;1;Starc to Overton, 1 run short and rising towards the body, 144kph as Overton jabs it away, just past Shaun Marsh at short leg!;

49.4;?;Starc to Woakes, no run short, not rising quite as high and this is defended from the crease;

48.2;W;Lyon to Ali, OUT flight and dip, it's chipped back in the air, waaaaaaaaayyyy to the left of the bowler... only for Lyon to pluck a one-handed screamer! Holy smokes! That's not nice, Garry, it's sensational! Slightly loose from Moeen, done by the ball dropping on him, but the connection was firm and it brought out the Superman in Lyon as he soared to his left and grabbed it with the surety that characterises everything Australia do right now;Moeen Ali c & b Lyon 25 (79m 57b 2x4 0x6) SR: 43.85;

35.1;?;Hazlewood to Ali, no run less drama in this delivery, from round the wicket;
34.6;1;Lyon to Ali, 1 run yowser! That explodes off the pitch, takes the shoulder of the bat and rips off Paine's elbow and over the slips! But the danger isn't over yet, as Malan calls the single and Moeen has to scamper to make his ground! Technically, that's a drop, and a run-out chance;
