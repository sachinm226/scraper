Data
11.57am: Now the real work starts for England. Having been held up for 40 minutes by the last pair, they will consider that another unsatisfactory passage; but the ease with which even Lyon managed to stroke a few handy runs should encourage England's batsmen too. They'll get half an hour before lunch, on a quick, flat pitch with a lightning outfield. This is England's series right now and Alastair Cook needs a few brave bulging buoyant clairvoyants centurions to step up from within the ranks. I'll be back with you in 10

96.3;?;Broad to Siddle, no run better length, wide of the stumps and left alone;

95.6;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run continues to seek out a good length outside off, Lyon pokes and edges low to second slip on the bounce;

91.5;W;Anderson to Smith, OUT this cuts through Smith as he props forward, there's a thin sound, Anderson goes up immediately... Umpire Marais Erasmus isn't convinced but England ask to review straight away. Smith stood his ground, unruffled, but we're going to find out what technology thinks; there may be a tiny mark on Hot Spot, quite faint, on the inside of the bat, Real Time Snicko now comes to the party and suggests a little scrape of wood too...

88.2;W;Broad to Johnson, OUT super ball, bounce and movement and Prior snaffles the edge - Johnson vanquished first up! That's the perfect start for England, no runs added and the dangerous Johnson back in the hutch. They said the pitch would be quicker today and we might just seen evidence of that, a length ball fizzing off the pitch from middle and leg to brush the shoulder of the bat... Though Mitch might not mind seeing that, either;Mitchell Johnson c ?Prior b Broad 39 (78m 62b 6x4 0x6) SR: 62.9;

England want the ball changed, suggesting a split seam. Not sure they're going to get their way
 Innings Start
12.20pm: Another rum showing from England in the first innings, especially after they had put on 85 for the first wicket. Australia have a more-than-handy 134-run lead and will come out to bat again refreshed and with the added vim of knowing that the Ashes are near-as-damn-it theirs. See you in a bit
87.6;W;Siddle to Anderson, OUT short, Anderson turns his head and spoons the ball up off the shoulder of the bat, straight to the man at short leg. Australia have mopped up the innings in efficient fashion - and they've earned themselves an early lunch, as well;James Anderson c Bailey b Siddle 2 (22m 9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 22.22;
87.5;1;Siddle to Swann, 1 run length ball, bounces quite high and clips the inside edge as Swann plays back, rolls short on the leg side via the pad and they pick up a single;
87.4;?;Siddle to Swann, no run another well-directed bouncer but Swann isn't interested at getting involved with those;
87.3;?;Siddle to Swann, no run more short stuff, steepling over the crouching Swann;
87.2;1;Siddle to Anderson, 1 run back of a length, at the body, Anderson nudges it down to fine leg for a single that brings up the 250 for England - worth a burst of Jingle Bells from the Barmy Army trumpeter;

86.1;?;Harris to Anderson, no run Harris thinks he's wrapped things up, Anderson playing inside one and Haddin taking the catch. There was a noise, though only the bowler was convinced - still, worth a review. It was ball flipping the back pad, however, hitting Anderson outside the line of off, so not out on both counts;
85.6;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs full again, wide of the stumps and thrashed away through backward point, another freebie four for Swann;
85.5;?;Johnson to Swann, no run now Johnson pitches the ball up, outside leg stump though and Swann gets an inside edge on to his pad, falling well short of the leg-side catchers;

83.6;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs Johnson now goes full, Swann's equal to it and drives four through the covers, not much cover out there;
83.5;?;Johnson to Swann, no run short, lickety split at 91mph, Swann backs away and tries to hit the cover off it, once again fails to connect;

82.1;?;Harris to Bresnan, no run fullish length ball, heading towards leg stump, pushed to the on side;

81.5;?;Johnson to Swann, no run back of a length and down the leg side, Swann plays at it and gets hit on the thigh pad;
81.4;W;Johnson to Broad, OUT full, fast and pinning Broad in front, that's gone! The batsman caught hanging back and Johnson bursts through again, Bowden didn't need asking twice - that was crashing into the middle of middle stump about two inches up, would probably have splayed all three poles;Stuart Broad lbw b Johnson 5 (23m 13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.46;
81.3;?;Johnson to Broad, no run slightly short, gets in line and blocks into the off side;

80.2;?;Watson to Bresnan, no run fullish and on off stump, pushed defensively back down the track;
80.1;4;Watson to Bresnan, FOUR runs pitched up and in the slot for Bresnan to tallywhack a cover drive past mid-off for a creamy four;
79.6;1;Siddle to Bresnan, 1 run short of a length and rising at the body, there's a short leg in place and Bresnan does well to jab the ball down behind square for a single;

79.4;?;Siddle to Bresnan, no run another bumper, heading over the top of middle and leg, Bresnan folds himself in half;

79.1;?;Siddle to Bresnan, no run hits the deck hard, halfway down the pitch, the ball sails past the ducking Bresnan down the leg side;

77.5;?;Siddle to Broad, no run short and again left alone;
77.4;?;Siddle to Broad, no run short ball to start with, flies through as Broad crouches out of the way;
77.3;W;Siddle to Prior, OUT slightly back of a length, Prior pulls across the line and gets a thin bottom edge - Australia have another! Spot on tactics from Clarke, with Siddle getting Prior for the 11th time in Tests. It was not a shot he needed to attempt, particularly after playing and missing twice, and his woes continue. As do England's;Matt Prior c ?Haddin b Siddle 8 (35m 24b 1x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;

73.6;W;Johnson to Stokes, OUT pitched up and inviting the drive, edged and gone!

73.5;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run dug in very short, climbing high over Stokes;
73.4;1b;Johnson to Prior, 1 bye short and aiming at the cracks mid-pitch, bullseye for Johnson, though the results are unpredictable and Haddin has to leap to his right to get a glove on the ball as it shoots away from the batsman, manages to keep them to a single bye;

73.2;2;Johnson to Prior, 2 runs goes a but fuller, on the stumps and worked through midwicket for a couple;

70.3;W;Harris to Bell, OUT the in-ducker this time, Bell is hit on the front pad but Erasmus shakes his head... Might have been outside the line? Height could also come into it; Australia decide to review, so we'll find out. And Hawk-Eye has it clattering into the top of middle stump, Bell's a goner! Looked to be DRS in hope rather than expectation from Clarke, with the knowledge that the reviews would be topped up in ten overs' time, but it has paid out big time;Ian Bell lbw b Harris 15 (90m 71b 2x4 0x6) SR: 21.12;

45.5;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run full again, not quite up there to drive so it's just blocked with a careful forward press;
45.4;4;Johnson to Pietersen, FOUR runs nails this one, half-volley just outside off and Pietersen times the pants off it past mid-off, much better delivery for the stroke and he executed it well;
45.3;?;Johnson to Pietersen, no run flashed at outside off, takes a thick outside edge and it lands short of gully, fortunate for Pietersen because that was loose, lack of foot movement on the stroke;

 Innings Start
11.50am: Australia have declared, setting England 504 to win. Ha! Their ears are still ringing, the sun blinding their eyes, probably even Alastair Cook is now sweating a bead or two - his team have to bat more than five sessions if they are going to avoid defeat and keep the Ashes for a couple of weeks longer. They were ran ragged in that session, conceding 134 runs in 17 overs; I fear this could get messy.
Here's Jonathan, voicing the thoughts of many: "It's as if they've given up! Credit to Australia of course... But I really thought the disappointments of Atherton et al being smashed by the cocksure Aussies were well behind us. Alas, I was wrong."

85.3;1;Bresnan to Bailey, 1 run you didn't think it could get worse, did you? It has...

Cook calls on Joe Root for an over before tea
 Innings Start
So before Christmas, the Ashes are done and dusted and now Australia have the chance to push for another whitewash. But Melbourne and Sydney are two grounds where England have traditionally been more comfortable and they will be desperate to respond having been totally outplayed so far. Australia are on a roll and head to Boxing Day in fine fettle with players in form and confidence high. That's when we'll be back, so have a good break and rejoin us for the fourth Test. But from Monty and I, for now, it's goodbye and Merry Christmas!

Here's the Presentation. Man of the Match goes to Steve Smith for that century on day one which set the game up for Australia. He describes the knock as the innings of his life.

Alastair Cook has to begin another post-mortem: "It was a fantastic innings full of character from Ben Stokes. With those cracks there it's daunting but he played so well. You never know in sport but just as we got a partnership going we lost it, not for the first time in this series. It's not for lack of effort but we've been out-skilled in all departments, that's the honest truth. Everyone's hurting now but all we can do is work as hard as we can and turn it around on Boxing Day.

Michael Clarke can't get to the microphone quickly enough:"10 out of 10, it doesn't get much better. Team performance has been exceptional. We went through what England are feeling now in England but we've now got our earned reward. I didn't say too much at lunch. We didn't get much luck in the morning session but we held our chances well after lunch. No doubt Mitch deserves a lot of credit but it's been a team performance over three matches. And there's a lot of people behind the scenes that don't get the credit they deserve so to those people that have stuck by us, thank you."

England have been well off the pace yet again with the bat and that has cost them dearly. They have been chasing matches throughout this series and this was no different. At least Ben Stokes stuck his hand up, showed some bravery and technique and mental fortitude to make a magnificent hundred and the rest of the dressing room surely have to look at Stokes and think, if a bloke playing his second Test can do it, why can't we? The batting failure came off the back off another chance - for the third Test running - with the ball in the first innings. But Australia responded in a manner winning sides managed to do - how many times did England come back from 30 for 3 at home in the last series?

It's pretty much been the same tale as the first two Tests, Australia won the toss and battled hard through a spot of bother to make a solid first innings score. England then failed to stay in the game with another sloppy opening dig with the bat and from there, Australia dominated with big runs second time around and managed to swat off a bit of England resistance. The Australian attack has again been superb, three nagging seamers, complimented by Nathan Lyon whose contribution cannot be underestimated, and, of course, Mitchell Johnson's raw pace that has rattled England to their core.

Australia have completed the turnaround and a 150-run victory has put them 3-0 up and enough to regain the Ashes for the first time since 2006-07. Mitchell Johnson has a tear in his eye as his celebrates, he has been the difference between these sides and the reason why almost the same teams have produced a markedly different result from the last series. "Proper emotion" Ryan Harris has just described as the Australians realise their ambitions in only 14 days of this series.

103.2;W;Johnson to Anderson, OUT back of a length on the stumps, Anderson square up and pops a chance into the leg side which Bailey dives forward to take and Australia have regained the Ashes. Pace doing for Anderson who got it high on the bat and presented a straightforward catch to Bailey and fittingly it is Mitchell Johnson that has finished it off;James Anderson c Bailey b Johnson 2 (9m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;

101.5;1;Johnson to Anderson, 1 run back of a length at the body, Anderson turns it down to long leg, just a single;
101.4;?;Johnson to Anderson, no run full toss on the stumps, Anderson turns it to midwicket;
101.3;W;Johnson to Bresnan, OUT slower ball, 82mph, Bresnan forward pushing hard and it presents a chance to Rogers at mid-off who dives and takes a fine catch to his right that is a perfect example of how well Australia have fielded in this series, a marvellous catch;Tim Bresnan c Rogers b Johnson 12 (66m 40b 1x4 0x6) SR: 30;
101.2;2;Johnson to Bresnan, 2 runs full and wide and Bresnan drives from low on the bat past extra cover and Broad gingerly waddles back for two;

Swann propped forward on around middle and followed the ball that turned in and bounced a touch, he got a feather edge onto the pad and it popped up easily for Smith and Swann walked straight off;Graeme Swann c Smith b Lyon 4 (8m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
100.1;?;Lyon to Swann, no run forward and let go outside off, it comes back a little but not enough to trouble off stump;

99.5;?;Johnson to Bresnan, no run now goes very full and Bresnan punches from outside off to extra cover;

98.2;W;Lyon to Stokes, OUT now goes to sweep from outside off and gets a thin edge behind that is well held from Haddin and the Australians are cock-a-hoop with the big wicket, Stokes has played a blinding innings. He went to sweep a delivery at least a foot outside off, he went hard trying to fetch it towards midwicket but the ball again ran straight on, took a feather under-edge and Haddin held on well in his fingertips;Ben Stokes c ?Haddin b Lyon 120 (256m 195b 18x4 1x6) SR: 61.53;
98.1;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run shoulders arms outside off but it runs on with the arm and flicks the pad marginally outside off stump, would have missed the stumps;
97.6;?;Johnson to Bresnan, no run bumper over leg stump, Bresnan ducks;
97.5;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run short and pulled, almost taking out Billy Bowden who hits the deck, does well to get under it in the end, deep square fields;

96.1;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run floated up outside off, left alone;

94.1;?;Lyon to Stokes, no run slightly short and wide and chopped of the back foot towards point;
93.6;?;Siddle to Bresnan, no run Bresnan again begins to play before drawing his bat inside the line, good testing over from Siddle;
93.5;?;Siddle to Bresnan, no run ooh, so close, some extra bounce and Bresnan flirts with it before remembering that he's spoken for;
93.4;?;Siddle to Bresnan, no run Siddles goes wide on the crease and angles the ball in, blocked into the covers;

90.5;4;Lyon to Stokes, FOUR runs floated up on middle and off stump, Stokes gives him the charge again and hoicks the ball over wide mid-on, it actually came off the inside half of the bat, bit of a mishit but there was enough for it to bounce once before reaching the rope;
90.4;1;Lyon to Bresnan, 1 run Bresnan works a length ball off his legs;
90.3;1;Lyon to Stokes, 1 run drops a little short this time and cut off the back foot for one;

87.6;4;Johnson to Stokes, FOUR runs short and wide and he throws the bat, gets a thick edge over gully and that will run away too;
87.5;4;Johnson to Stokes, FOUR runs digs the ball in again, Stokes pulls and gets some glove on it, enough to take it wide of Haddin and down to the long-leg boundary - that's his ton, he does a fist pump as the crowd stands. It's been a superb innings, a maiden hundred in his second Test;
87.4;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run pitched up on the stumps, meets it with a textbook straight drive but Johnson gets a hand to it, deflecting the ball into the umpire - not far from catching Bresnan out of his ground, either;
87.3;2;Johnson to Stokes, 2 runs another couple, again attacking the short stuff, not quite as in control as a pull loops in front of square;
87.2;2;Johnson to Stokes, 2 runs shortens his length, not a full-blooded bouncer and Stokes keeps on top of it, pulls a couple in front of deep midwicket;
87.1;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run Johnson thunders through on a length outside off stump, Stokes watches impassively;
86.6;1;Harris to Stokes, 1 run short and at the batsman, who takes it on, gloving a pull down towards long leg for a single;

85.3;?;Johnson to Bresnan, no run slightly back of a length, rearing through to Haddin as Bresnan plays inside the line;
85.2;W;Johnson to Prior, OUT good length, wide of the stumps, Prior swishes at it ... and nicks off! There was an audible noise, the ball was just too quick for him, didn't need to play out there but those attacking instincts got the better of him. Johnson takes the acclaim as a roar of relief ripples round the ground;Matt Prior c ?Haddin b Johnson 26 (110m 72b 3x4 0x6) SR: 36.11;
85.1;?;Johnson to Prior, no run gets across his stumps to defend around the line of off;

84.4;?;Harris to Stokes, no run length delivery on off stump, played back down the track;

83.2;?;Johnson to Prior, no run stays back and does well to keep out a length ball that stays low;

82.5;?;Harris to Prior, no run full and on the stumps, dug out into the leg side;
82.4;4;Harris to Prior, FOUR runs four more, this time slapped off the toes through square leg, though it could have been much worse for Australia, as Mitchell Johnson slid and caught his studs in the turf, jarring his knee at a horrible angle as he tried to prevent the boundary;
82.3;4;Harris to Prior, FOUR runs drops back and pushes with soft hand, opening the face of the bat and a low edge runs through the cordon for a boundary;

82.1;?;Harris to Prior, no run pitched up and heading down the leg side as it thumps into Prior's padding;
81.6;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run up at almost 91mph/146kph, in the corridor but it doesn't go off the straight and Stokes lifts his bat out of the way - England have made it to drinks. Five and a bit more hours to go. Nervous, Australia?;

81.4;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run Stokes gets on the front foot, watches the ball past, it swings a little on its way through to Haddin;

78.4;?;Watson to Stokes, no run pushed through in the channel outside off, defended;

74.1;1;Harris to Stokes, 1 run good length and pushed on the up into a gap in the covers for a single to Stokes;

72.1;?;Harris to Stokes, no run either Ryan Harris has got a wrist like Murali or this has hit a crack... a length ball jacknifes towards first slip, almost a yard away from the bat as Stokes pushed forwards;

71.1;?;Johnson to Prior, no run fullish, around off stump, Prior lines it up and blocks towards cover;

69.3;?;Johnson to Prior, no run Prior jerks in the crease like he's been poked with a cattle prod as a 91mph/146kph bouncer snorts past his head. Lummy;
69.2;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run goes for the inswinging yorker this time, the bat comes down just in time, squeezing one through his legs and behind square for a single;
69.1;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run slightly short outside off but not really there to pull, Stokes attempts to anyway but doesn't get anything on it;

63.4;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run leg-stump line, defended;
63.3;2;Siddle to Stokes, 2 runs bit of width on offer, opens the shoulders and cracks the ball through the covers, not out of the middle but that's two more to the Geordie scrapper;
63.2;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run gets across to defend a good-length ball;
63.1;2;Siddle to Stokes, 2 runs full length and on the pads, clipped into a gap at midwicket and Stokes wants two, could have been tight of the pick-up was clean (it wasn't);

59.6;W;Siddle to Bell, OUT dug in short, Bell tries to ramp the ball over the slips and there's a thin sound... Australia are convinced but it's not given by Erasmus and they have to resort to the DRS. There's no visible deflection, nothing on Hot Spot either but Real-Time Snicko detects a small blur of noise in the frame after the ball passes the bat and that's enough for Tony Hill, who overturns the decision. Bell's spritely resistance is over;Ian Bell c ?Haddin b Siddle 60 (140m 93b 7x4 1x6) SR: 64.51;

58.2;?;Watson to Stokes, no run length delivery a foot or two outside off, again no stroke offered;
58.1;?;Watson to Stokes, no run pushed across outside off stump, Stokes is back to leaving;

56.1;?;Watson to Bell, no run full and on middle stump, pushed back towards mid-on;
55.6;?;Siddle to Stokes, no run good pace, Stokes keeps it out in front of off stump;

54.4;?;Watson to Bell, no run this one grubs a little off a length and Bell has to have his wits about him to drop the bat on it in front of off;
54.3;?;Watson to Bell, no run tailing in and there's an inside edge on to pad that would have been snapped up by short leg - if there was one;
54.2;4;Watson to Bell, FOUR runs full again this time Bell laces the ball in front of square, lovely timing and that will be four, bringing the 200 up for England;
54.1;?;Watson to Bell, no run pitched up in the corridor outside off, Bell leaves;
53.6;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run short and Stokes takes it on again, through his pull a little early (if that's conceivable against Johnson) though and it dribbles to mid-on;
53.5;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run overpitched from Johnson and Stokes plays a gorgeous cover drive that is brilliantly stopped by the diving Bailey at mid-off - cricket is the winner;
53.4;4;Johnson to Stokes, FOUR runs quick and sliding towards leg stump, just a tickle of bat on this and the ball skips to the long leg boundary;
53.3;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run full of a length and wide, shaping slightly away, Stokes ignores it;
53.2;1lb;Johnson to Bell, 1 leg bye he can still give batsmen the hurry up, though, catching Bell on the body as he tries to get out of the way, the ball looping behind square;
53.1;?;Johnson to Bell, no run short of a length, Johnson operating at more normal uman levels of pace now, around 87mph/140kph, left alone outside off;

51.1;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run full and wide outside off, ignored;
50.6;1;Harris to Stokes, 1 run short and pulled from off stump, keeps it down nicely and runs it to the deep fielder;
50.5;4;Harris to Stokes, FOUR runs wider now and fuller so justified in reaching out to drive it through the covers, not totally timed but timed well enough;
50.4;?;Harris to Stokes, no run forward to a ball of similar line and plays and misses, should have left that, felt for it;
50.3;?;Harris to Stokes, no run full, sliding across Stokes who leaves alone;

Andrew: "Really, this is the best batting I have seen from England in this series. They have looked really fragile when they have just been defending. KP, Bell, and Stokes look much better when they are scoring runs. If only they could do this in their first innings."
