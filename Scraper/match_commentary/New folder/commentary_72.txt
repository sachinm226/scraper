Michael Hussey, Graeme Swann and Murali Kartik give their thoughts on Australia's total on the live show. Andrew Miller will be back to start the chase in a little while.
Innings break 2.05pm Alex Carey's late flourish gives Australia something to bowl at. They made a mess of an outstanding start. Aaron Finch and David Warner were superb up front on a difficult pitch but neither could kick on to a big score. Finch got out for exactly 100. Warner made 53 and then the side fell away from there.
Aaron Finch: "It would have been nice to go on with it. It's never ideal to get a hundred and then get out. There's still enough in the wicket though. That's a pretty good score. It wasn't the easiest wicket to start on, the ball was seaming. We were conscious to try and get through that with as little damage as possible and we were able to do that. We got ourselves into a decent position. We could have got a few more runs."
Nisar: "Fine cameo from Alex Carey to avoid a complete shutdown towards the end there from Australia."
Yash: "Finch and Warner score at less than run a ball and couldn't capitalise after reaching the milestones. 9 think it worked in favour of England as the likes of Maxwell Stoinis and Carey didn't get enough time . But nonetheless a decent total. Should be an interest chase. "

Thanks Andrew. Can't wait for this. Warner and Finch v Archer and Woakes upfront.

Meanwhile, there's another high-profile World Cup on across the English Channel, where some of the best teams in women's football are slugging it out for the title. What's attracting attention is not just the quality of play, but also conversations on gender equality
10.20am They'll be cranking out the anthems shortly. Here's Alex Malcolm to loosen his larynx for the first time today, as "'Straya Fair" gets ready to be belted out across St John's Wood ...
10.16am George Dobell has been on #CelebWatch this morning, because why not? "Ed Sheeran, Gareth Southgate, Glenn Hoddle, Dom Joly, David Cameron and John Major, Michael McIntyre, Damian Lewis, Greg James, Stephen Fry, Edward the Earl of Wessex, Laura Robson, Matt Bellamy (muse), Felicity Ward, Tommy Banks and Rory Bremner..." It's a right old rogue's gallery
Dave : "@varunkvk that's hilarious. Win predictor was always going to be 90% in favour of the team winning the toss today. If England screw this up, they don't deserve to win the World Cup. Bowl first was absolute nailed in certainty "
10.13am We're just minutes away from the start, which means minutes away from the lock-in time for your fantasy cricket team as well. Nathan Lyon's one of our picks for the day, so get him in real quick?
And if you haven't updated your Cricket Picks, then do so quickly ... I am currently locked in a death-match at the top of the Cricinfo in-house ladder with my newly Antipodean turncoat colleague, Andrew Gnasher McGlashan...
10.06am So, that is a very good start to the day for England, but they will need to make the early conditions work in their favour. Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer will be armed with the new white balls, you'd presume. Finch didn't seem too concerned at batting first, however. He and Warner have made a habit of being very measured at the start, and runs on the board have been a telling part of the World Cup story to date... as England found in their failed run-chase against Sri Lanka...
Varunkvk: "Bad decision by England to opt bowling. Their 2 losses are while chasing and Australia's most wins are while defending. Batting first is England's great suit and they didn't do that. #very disappointed" It's a fair point, but I do think the new ball could be vital today.
Mike: "Imagine if Jimmy was bowling in these conditions...." There was a theory put forward by my Guardian colleague Barney Ronay that England should have picked him for precisely a day like this. Not sure I totally agree, but imagine ten overs off the reel from 10.30am to 12!
England win toss and bowl! "It's not a no-brainer, it's a bit soft on top, but we haven't seen much sun down south so it might do a bit this morning."
"it builds confidence," Morgan says of beating Australia 5-0 last year. "For a long time we never won anything against Australia, but we have had some success recently and I think we have a good side."
"Jofra is good, he had stiffness in his side and we had a precautionary fitness test. We are confident,
"I'm not too disappointed batting," says Aaron Finch. "I wasn't too sure about the wicket, but I would have probably bowled first as well. We've played consistent cricket throughout without being outstanding. If you go too hard you leave yourself open at the back-end against some world-class death bowlers."
On the likelihood of a rough ride from the crowd, Finch adds: "We aren't really bothered about how the crowd react. Every game is crucial and we can't take any lightly."
England go with the same team, Australia make two changes.
England 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 James Vince, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Jofra Archer, 11 Mark Wood
Australia 1 Aaron Finch (capt), 2 David Warner, 3 Usman Khawaja, 4 Steven Smith, 5 Glenn Maxwell, 6 Marcus Stoinis, 7 Alex Carey (wk), 8 Jason Behrendorff, 9 Pat Cummins, 10 Mitchell Starc, 11 Nathan Lyon
9.58am Right, sit tight. The toss is coming up. And given the overheads, this flip of the coin could be half the battle won ...
Stephen: "Getting ready for my first full overnight watch of a game from Sydney. Looking forward to a cracker of a game. And really happy to hear Lyon is getting the nod today" It's a good selection. England have had plenty problems against him down the years, though mostly in Tests of course.
Jason Roy is doing some light sprints! This is an encouraging sign for England. If Mashrafe Mortaza, Chris Gayle, et al can play without hamstrings, he looks on course to be back for the India game.
9.54am George Dobell is on warm-up watch. "England playing football; Australia are catching. I think we'll need the lights but they are not on yet."
D S : "Who said Ashes can only be played in Whites. This is as big as the Ashes. " Valid.
Lakshitha: "All of a sudden, the Australian fan base has increased by leaps and bounds, if you know what I mean. Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis as well as the West Indians are singing in unison, Aussie Aussie Aussie...!!! ;)"
9.51am Daniel Brettig's Live Report is up and running, which includes a reference to the last time that England beat Australia at a World Cup ... way back in 1992. I remember that game, it turns out I even wrote about it too!
9.47am And what of the reception that Australia can expect to receive from the crowd? Eoin Morgan was invited to do a Virat Kohli, and encourage the fans not to boo David Warrner and Steve Smith, but he couldn't quite bring himself to do it ... Mind you, the Lord's crowd tend to be a less partisan bunch, although for ICC events, the usual rules need not apply. It could be a raucous reception ... even Jonny Bairstow's bromance with Warner seems to be on ice for now ...
9.45am Have England suffered their obligatory big-tournament banana peel already? Or is there more to follow, with games against India and New Zealand to come? Our latest Talking World Cup podcast wonders if they can become the tournament's Official Lolz Suppliers? (you can also listen on Apple Podcasts here)
9.40am So, what are we to make of the relative merits of these two teams? England, remember, have never won the World Cup. Australia are the defending champions and have hoovered up the trophy on a record five occasions. They know what it takes on the biggest stage ... as Jarrod Kimber points out in his telling analysis...
For England, Eoin Morgan is keeping his best poker-face in place, despite a massively dispiriting loss against Sri Lanka. There's no need to panic, he says...
Jofra Archer is fit to play," say the ECB. "Had a bowl through this morning. Precautionary. Felt some tightness in his left side." You can bet England wish they were in a position to rest him. No chance in a game this important ...
9.36am Alex Malcolm, who will be sharing the duties on the live commentary today, has been gleaning some intel on the likely Australia side.
"There was a whisper floating around yesterday that Lyon and Behrendorff were a huge chance to play," he says. "That was based on match ups. Lyon bowled beautifully to England in the warm-up game and sets up well for Morgan, Stokes, Moeen and has a superb record against Buttler in two games. The extra left-armer is again part match-up, part green track I think." And sure enough, it seems that Lyon has been marking out his run-up...
9.34am The suspicion from the sidelines is that England will be unchanged ... which means Mark Wood and Jofra Archer will be in harness once again, and James Vince will get another opportunity to partner Jonny Bairstow at the top of the order.
Shakeel: "How cruel this game is? Four cricketing nations are hoping for an England loss." Seems fair to me!
9.27am "Pitch still green," adds George, who warned that this might be the case in the preview yesterday, given that Australia and New Zealand need to have a vaguely intact surface when they use the same strip on Saturday. The live grass will help keep it together. But it'll be fun for whoever gets first use!
Nauman Sharjeel: "I think it is going to be one of the best contests of this World Cup. Should be rated above India Pakistan as both Australia and England are amazing teams and arch rivals. " For hype, nothing comes close to India V Pakistan, but yes, this ought to be a humdinger. Even if their World Cup head-to-head is almost as one-sided...
Ali C: "G'morning Miller. Read of a thunderstorm headed towards London last night. What's the weather like?" It was very wet last night, but it's not currently raining, and Lord's drainage is the most ludicrously slurpy in the world game. It could drain the Murray-Darling in an hour given half a chance....
9.25am "Archer is fine," declares George Dobell, who has strolled onto the scene of the drama and done his best Red Adair impression. You'll never cut it in the tabloids, George ...
"Very heavy atmosphere," he adds, of the weather, presumably, rather than the vibe. "Like Sri Lanka, a bit. A win toss and bowl morning." I can vouch for the humidity levels in London this morning, the tube was like a sauna. And not one of those pleasant Finnish ones with an ice bath at the end of it.
9.22am Early drama at Lord's! Jofra Archer is having a fitness test! This is not good news for England at all. Their newest pace weapon has reportedly picked up a side problem ... and is being put through his paces as we speak. Will keep you posted...
9.15am Good morning all, and welcome to the start of the World Cup proper. We've had a 31-match prologue - and jolly fun it has been too. But this is a proper heavyweight contest with proper grown-up consequences on the line. It's England v Australia, the World No.1s versus the serial World Cup champions, at the home of cricket no less. And there's a whole lot of jeopardy at stake too.
To the victor, the bragging rights, two precious points in the final push towards the semi-finals, and breathing room between themselves and the chasing pack - Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh. To the loser, existential angst and the prospect of a squeaky closing week, with the unbeaten New Zealanders awaiting both teams, as well as India v England and Australia v South Africa (who will surely try to raise their game before skulking out of the back door)... sit tight, this one is unmissable!



 Innings Start
6.30pm Right, that's your lot for today. And to think last week, we were worried about the top four being locked out before the end of the round robin ... trust England to keep the group stages lively with their habitual chaos. It was like this in 2011 and 2015 too ... but they remain a vastly better team now than in either of those campaigns, in spite of appearances today. As for Australia, well, the defending champions have just flexed their muscles to supreme effect.
Sunday at Edgbaston, England v India. It can't come quickly enough! From Andrew Miller, Alex Malcolm and Chandan Duorah, good night
6.21pm So, a final word on the points table. Australia's qualification is secure because they have already won six games - even if others equal their points, they will have more wins which is the first criteria ahead of NRR.
Lakshman Kumar: "Australia showing how dominant they are when it comes to WC..! England as usual crashing out before the Semis..! South Africa's WC woes continue..! NZ and India's habit of making it to the Semis is on course..! Pakistan's usual dark horse performances are intact..! So after all the hype, normal service has been restored..!! "
As for England, well, it is now looking like fourth or bust ... 12 points is the most that they can now get ... and it would take some freak results for India, New Zealand and Australia not to get more than that. But as Morgan says, their destiny is in their own hands. Beat India and New Zealand, they are through. Beat one of them, and they still have hope. It's not ideal ... but they have two games to reach the semi-finals. They are... err ... through to the Last 16 of a ten-team World Cup ...
6.19pm Australia in World Cup while defending 275+ targets ... played 25, won 25... Fetch that and bowl me another!
6.13pm Time for some presentations. Here's Eoin Morgan: "I thought a lot of today we were outplayed, Australia played and missed a lot and built a good partnership, and us losing early wickets wasn't ideal. The wicket was soft when we started, batting would have been a horrific decision. They dominated until the 25th but to restrict them to 280 was a good effort. But to be 20 for 3 pegs us bad considerably. Given the circumstances it's not hugely disappointed, our fate is in our own hands. Everything we need to turn around is quite simple, the basics have let us down, and hopefully we will improve on them moving forward."
Finch on qualification: "That's the first part ticked off, which is a really nice feeling. I think England are a stand-out side who can take you apart with ball and bat quite quickly. It was nice that we found ways to keep getting wickets."
"Behrendorff bowled beautifully, we've you've got a guy who can swing the ball back down the line to the right handers, that's an asset. And Warner is playing nicely, people say it's not the Warner of old, but there's bowling that demands respect, and today was close to his best. You're looking to be positive, but he got us off to a good start. We're confident with what we've got, and we've won five World Cups in our history."
6.10pm Bharath Seervi has dug out the instances of nine wickets being shared by opening bowlers in a WC game. It's a rare feat, more usually achieved against, err, lesser teams
Jon: "Why was Finch given MoM when Behrendorff got a five for? I think Behrendorff earned it more than Finch" He stuck it out in massively tricky conditions this morning. A close call, but justifiable even in this batsman's game.
WATCH on Hotstar (India only): Ben Stokes played a lone hand for England
Player of the Match is Aaron Finch. "I didn't play too badly, it's nice to get a hundred in a win. To get sent in on a wicket that was seaming around ... Woakesy bowled a hell of a spell. There's teams that you have a bit more confidence when you walk out and play. It was nipping around and seaming but we played well to rein it in, and cash in on width."
Dawood: "This is what overconfidence can bring. Eng were a bit too easy while chasing against SL and all of a sudden they are under a lot of pressure. "
6.02pm Wow. Behrendorff, five wickets. Starc, four wickets. Left-arm quicks, 9 for 87 all told! England have been yorker-ised in the World Cup Ashes showdown, and now their campaign really is on the ropes!
Well, Jarrod Kimber called it before the match. There's a World Cup pedigree that Australia can tap into, one that England can only gaze upon longingly. Despite a gutsy 89 from Ben Stokes - one that was ended by the ball of the tournament so far - they never came close to challenging their target.
Rohit Raman: "Please explain how could Australia qualify as broadcaster showing as 5 teams can reach 12 or more points?? " It might have something to do with England and India playing each other. One or both is going to drop points.

3.4;?;Starc to Morgan, no run banged into the hip, Morgan shuffles across his crease;
3.3;W;Starc to Root, OUT there's the inswinger again! Pace, length, inswing, it's a stunning triple whammy, and though Root thinks of the review, he knows it is utterly plumb! He was simply late on the stroke once again, even though his entire set-up had been primed for it. These are very, very dangerous signs for the world No.1s!;Joe Root lbw b Starc 8 (16m 9b 2x4 0x6) SR: 88.88;
3.2;?;Starc to Root, no run stiff-limbed once more, as Root fences this off the front foot into the covers;
3.1;?;Starc to Root, no run driven, loosely, and passes the inside edge! Tentative and extravagant from Root, very hard hands, and too late on the stroke too;
2.6;?;Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run tight into the pads, Bairstow loses one hand on the bat as he attempts to deflect off the hip;
2.5;?;Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run solidly forward, defending on off stump;
2.4;4;Behrendorff to Bairstow, FOUR runs perfect timing, meeting the inswing with a clip off the pads. Full face on contact, clean through long-on;
2.3;?;Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run attempted pull, whistles into the midriff;
2.2;?;Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run solid, full face, defending on off stump with a loud "no!";
2.1;?;Behrendorff to Bairstow, no run pops from just back of a length, angled across Bairstow who is anchored on the back foot, wary of the inswinger. Beaten outside off;
1.6;?;Starc to Root, no run a calm leave on a fuller length outside off. It's been a bit skittish from England so far, but no further chances...;
1.5;4;Starc to Root, FOUR runs whoops, can't bowl there to Root! Swinging on a leg-stump line, ever further past the stumps, Root places bat on ball and tickles it fine through the finest of fine legs;
1.4;1;Starc to Bairstow, 1 run fuller length outside off, Bairstow brings out the kitchen sink and scuffs a wild drive on the bounce to third man;
1.3;2;Starc to Bairstow, 2 runs wristy from Bairstow... not quite to the pitch, not quite timed either, but plinked through the gap in the covers with an open face and lots of momentum;
1.2;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run wider line, 147kph, which isn't too shabby, nips away as Bairstow leaves alone;
1.1;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run jeepers, that's a good leave! Outside off, nipping back in, skims past the off stump with good carry! Starc hitting the seam from the get-go;
0.6;4;Behrendorff to Root, FOUR runs short, wide, chancy! It was confident enough in the end, but a touch tentative on the cut as Root placed the ball past a leaping Maxwell at backward point. England are up and running ...;
0.5;?;Behrendorff to Root, no run ploughing a tight line across the right-hander, nip away from the bat once more as Root leaves alone;
0.4;?;Behrendorff to Root, no run up on the toes, punched with stiff forearms into the covers;
0.3;?;Behrendorff to Root, no run outside off, and this one nips off the seam away towards the cordon;
0.2;W;Behrendorff to Vince, OUT massive inswinger and Vince has been castled! Shades of Starc to Brendon McCullum in the World Cup final 2015, looking to drive but nowhere near the ball, and huge jubilation for the Aussies! Wow, what a start! If England thought they could shake off their nerves with belligerence, they've got another thing coming!;James Vince b Behrendorff 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
0.1;?;Behrendorff to Vince, no run left-arm over the wicket with a tight leg-stump line to the right-hander, solid in defence, up to mid-on;

2.33pm So, out come England's openers, Jonny Bairstow and James Vince. Mitchell Starc, Australia's primary menace, was feeling his hamstring when batting at the end of their innings ... he's not taking the newest of new balls ... Jason Behrendorff has first dibs. Interesting...
2.28pm Well hello again. Are you ready for the showdown? England's target is 286 - perhaps 40 runs fewer than Australia would have anticipated after 30 overs, and meat and drink for a side that has been putting 300 on the board for fun in this tournament ... until of course that nerve-shattering implosion against Sri Lanka last week ... is today redemption day, or the beginning of the end? If Australia can hold out, they will be through to the semi-finals. It's all to play for!
