Phew. What a whirlwind 90 minutes that was. An amazing innings and most of it was from Aaron Finch who blasted the highest individual score in a T20 international, it was a blistering innings and he blew England away from the very first ball he faced - which went for six! Australia have the second-highest international T20 total and surprise, surprise, England will need a record chase to win the match. Monty will see if they can pull off a miracle in 10 minutes time...
19.6;2;Dernbach to Faulkner, 2 runs full and straight, dug out down the ground, they sprint and get back for two, well ran;
19.5;2;Dernbach to Faulkner, 2 runs another slower ball on the stumps, a little pitching wedge over the in-field, long-off runs around to field;
19.4;1;Dernbach to Wade, 1 run full just outside off, pushed to cover point, they again run without thought;
19.3;?;Dernbach to Wade, no run slower ball, Wade looks a little silly in aiming a big strike over the leg side, totally deceived and misses;
19.2;1;Dernbach to Faulkner, 1 run same delivery, driven to extra cover, they run automatically and the fielder doesn't bother to throw;
19.1;W;Dernbach to Maxwell, OUT full and straight, Maxwell misses and Dernbach takes out his off stump, Dernback picking up a few late wickets here. Simple modus operandi there, quick delivery from slightly wide on the crease angled into the stumps and I did warn the Aussies about missing straight balls;Glenn Maxwell b Dernbach 1 (9m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
18.6;4;Finn to Wade, FOUR runs pulls this off the front foot over the leg side, doesn't quite nail it and there's a chance for Hales at deep midwicket, he dives forward but can't take the catch and lets it bounce past him for four more;
18.5;6;Finn to Wade, SIX runs length a foot wide of off stump, Wade able to take a clean swing at it and clears long-on, great strike;
18.4;4;Finn to Wade, FOUR runs short again, this time at the body and Wade able to pull it past short long leg, wrong line with this field, only needed some bat to take it to the fence;
18.3;?;Finn to Wade, no run short, slower ball, swung at and Wade gets a thin bottom edge on the bounce to the keeper;
18.2;?;Finn to Wade, no run length ball sliding away from Wade who follows it outside off and plays and misses;
18.1;W;Finn to Bailey, OUT full on the stumps, Bailey tried to tickle it into the leg side, missed and it given out lbw straight by the umpire. Bailey got across his stumps and try to flick a full delivery towards midwicket but he missed and when you're in front of all three it ain't a good idea to be missing the ball;George Bailey lbw b Finn 1 (3m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;
17.6;?;Dernbach to Maxwell, no run another slower ball, really nice again, Maxwell almost swings himself off his feet and misses by a mile;
17.5;1;Dernbach to Bailey, 1 run full toss on off stump, rolled carefully down to long-off;
17.4;W;Dernbach to Watson, OUT fabulous slower ball, Watson totally sold down the river and loses his leg stump. Classic Dernbach, back of the hand change up, Watson aimed to leg but knew he was through with the shot far too soon and the ball cannoned into the base of leg stump, Watson already walking back to the hutch;Shane Watson b Dernbach 37 (30m 16b 4x4 2x6) SR: 231.25;
17.3;1;Dernbach to Maxwell, 1 run full outside off, dabbed into the covers;
17.2;W;Dernbach to Finch, OUT slower ball, Finch backs to leg, swings square and drags it onto middle stump ending a truly spectacular innings.

17.1;4;Dernbach to Finch, FOUR runs full just outside off, Finch slugs it down the ground and boo! Only four, muscled away;

16.5;6;Briggs to Finch, SIX runs another full toss, this outside off stump, Finch, times the pants off it again and pummels it into the seats over midwicket, that's now the most number of sixes in a international T20;
16.4;?;Briggs to Finch, no run low full toss, Finch backed away and finds extra cover, a dot!;
16.3;6;Briggs to Finch, SIX runs down the track and this time Morgan watches it sail over his head, huge, lovely timing;
16.2;6;Briggs to Finch, SIX runs dragged down and heaved over the leg side, Morgan dives back at deep midwicket but there's enough carry to get that for six more;
16.1;4;Briggs to Finch, FOUR runs full and slapped over the bowler's head to bring up the 200;

15.1;6;Broad to Finch, SIX runs short on off stump, Finch steps away and heaves it over cover, what a shot, that's now the highest score in T20 internationals;
14.6;2;Wright to Watson, 2 runs now a full toss wide of off stump, hammered wide of long-off, Lumb slides and saves the boundary but they get two more;
14.5;6;Wright to Watson, SIX runs full length a foot outside off, Watson clears the front leg and smashes it straight over the bowler's head, straight as a dye and all the way for six;

Awful bowling, so much length to hit, great hitting though...
 Innings Start
10.10pm: We've just seen more than twice as many runs in 40 overs as England scored in 98 at The Oval last Friday. What does that tell us? Probably something terrible... Anyway, Gnasher's report will chronicle tonight's circus freakshow of batting - join us again in a couple of days for the rematch. Cheerio
10pm: Right, time for the post-match rubdown. England captain, Stuart Broad: "We're really disappointed that we lost but full credit has to go to the way Australia batted, Finch especially. We tried everything but he was unstoppable, he hit 14 sixes, it was incredible. His first ball went for six. We knew it was going to be a good wicket but not quite that good. The batsmen want to pitch a tent up here and the bowlers want to get on the flight to Durham. Hopefully we get the same excitement up there, though. Joe did incredibly well in his first international T20 innings, it's what we've come to expect."
Australia captain, George Bailey: "I think the only innings I've seen like [Finch's] was Chris Gayle in the IPL. When he hits sixes he tries to hit them 40 rows back... We've found that Watto is so good at playing spin bowling, with a view to the next World T20, we can have him come in at four and take them out. We knew it was going to be a really good wicket and would be a hard ground to defend. There are always a few things to work on, though. I thought we bowled back of a length a bit more, and changed things up. We were a bit short to Root, who likes it there. Fawad Ahmed's last over was nice, his first game, big occasion but he go through it okay."
Aaron Finch, to the surprise of no one, is named Man of the Match: "It's good to come here from the Australia A side and play some good cricket. It was one of those days, not easy for the quicks, no spin, so I managed to get it away." Nice line in understatement, there, from the man who made the highest-ever score in Twenty20 internationals earlier tonight.
9.50pm: By most available metrics, Australia smashed that. It was a contest that rained sixes (until England batted), sweated fours, the highest-scoring T20 international ever - England made their second-highest score and still lost by a distance. Aaron Finch stamped his mark so hard on the game that England will still feel sore when they wake up tomorrow morning. Joe Root's jaw might also smart, after getting clocked by his third ball, but again he showed he doesn't mind wearing one - and that was his first T20I knock, too.
19.6;1;Faulkner to Root, 1 run dropped, off the last ball! Root swished across the line, got a thin inside edge but Wade grassed it, they scamper one more as the ball ran behind the keeper - but it's fairly academic, as Australia win by 39 runs;
19.5;1b;Faulkner to Broad, 1 bye Broad swings and misses, they run anyway as Wade underarms past the stumps;
19.4;4;Faulkner to Broad, FOUR runs no but he'll get four instead, standing up and levering the ball back over the bowler's head, mid-off is up and the ball races away;

18.2;4;Watson to Root, FOUR runs plays the reverse ramp, catches it on the full and flicks the ball low, straight to the man on the edge of the circle - but unfortunately that man is Fawad Ahmed, who completely misjudges it and the ball escapes his grasp like a bar of soap and runs for four;
