Data
6.32pm Welcome back. England need 305 to win at the MCG, and lay down a significant marker in this five-match ODI series. No side has ever chased more than 300 at Melbourne, but England will fancy their chances with a power-packed line-up.
***
Australia have finished with 304. Which team will be happier? Reckon it's pretty even, although nothing scares England when it comes to chasing these days. A superb hundred from Finch, excellent hitting from Stoinis and a supporting fifty from Mitchell Marsh. The bowling was a bit of a mix - Wood and Moeen very good, Woakes disappointing, Rashid expensive but took two key wickets and Plunkett solid. We'll be back at 6.30pm for the chase.
49.6;4;Plunkett to Tye, FOUR runs and he gets a boundary, because the fielder at deep midwicket committed to trying to make the catch! Heave into the deep, Bairstow went for the catch, the ball fell in front of him, then couldn't stop it;
49.5;W;Plunkett to Cummins, OUT this is a long way up...and taken at long on. Jason Roy runs in, steadies himself, and makes no mistake. Cummins aiming to clear the leg side, got too much height and not enough distance;Pat Cummins c Roy b Plunkett 12 (14m 10b 1x4 0x6) SR: 120;
49.4;4;Plunkett to Cummins, FOUR runs that helps...gets a top edge as he swings across the line of a short delivery, goes straight back over the keeper. Takes Australia to 300;
49.3;?;Plunkett to Cummins, no run he's moving around the crease, and then fails to back contact with a back-of-a-length ball. Another dot;
49.2;W;Plunkett to Paine, OUT well judged on the rope! As calm as you like from Moeen. A short ball, goes for the pull, gets a top edge, Moeen, at deep backward square, is in the shadows which are starting to come across the ground but knows exactly where the rope is and pouches the catch;Tim Paine c Ali b Plunkett 27 (56m 31b 3x4 0x6) SR: 87.09;

48.5;1;Wood to Paine, 1 run short, pulled in the air towards fine leg, where Rashid doesn't judge it very well, doesn't start running forward to make the catch, but still stops the boundary;

48.3;1lb;Wood to Paine, 1 leg bye gets a bottom edge as he swings to the leg side, dribbles behind him through his legs...ah, not quite through the legs! Rebounds off a delicate area. Ouch;

48.1;2;Wood to Cummins, 2 runs gives himself room outside leg stump and then goes over the off side;

47.6;?;Woakes to Paine, no run he's move all around his crease here, looking for a scoop, Woakes cleverly fires it wide outside off...and excellent umpiring not to call that wide, have to give the bowlers something;
47.5;1;Woakes to Cummins, 1 run that's a big full toss, straight, pushed into the covers...below waist height, so not a no-ball;

10.5;W;Rashid to Smith, OUT he's got Smith! What a strike for Rashid. Gets it outside off, just a hint of turn, and a thin nick to Buttler.

 Innings Start
10.25pm So, that sums things up from the first ODI. Have a read of Dan Brettig's match report before you go, and we'll see you at the Gabba for Match 2 out of 5 in what promises to be a high-octane ODI series.
10.20pm Time for some presentations. First up, Australia's skipper. "He didn't give us a chance, and he chanced his arm," says Steve Smith of an awesome Jason Roy innings. "They got off to an absolute flyer and we couldn't pull them back."
Unsurprisingly, Jason Roy is man of the match. "Incredibly special, I don't have too many words right now. Halesy was pretty disappointed [to lose his England ODI highest score]. It had been a tough season last season, so to be selected was incredibly special.
"I was so happy, first time here, what an incredlble place," he says of the MCG. And his hand is "okay", he says...
10.15pm Ben: "Yet again Root fails to convert. When will England selectors come to their senses? " I know... shocking... Still, a tremendous supporting hand from England's back-to-the-ranks No.4, who has reaffirmed his class across formats
"He's imposing at the crease, and what a way to start the series," says England's captain, Eoin Morgan. "It sums up the character of the bloke, coming back in."
"Australia are a strong side and will come back incredibly hard at Brisbane, but it's a nice way to start the series."
10.11pm England win with seven balls to spare on a memorable night at the MCG. A record innings, a first-ever chase of a 300-plus total by any side at Australia's grandest ground, and a vital calling-card from a one-day squad that has high expectations, and plenty of English pride to salvage
Dan: "Well, they are bottling it. Obviously they are in such a dominant position that they will win, but as an earlier commenter said, it's not a good sign for their bigger picture." That earlier commentator now accuses me of spinning his words like an American politician, but seeing as another naysayer has now endorsed his words, he clearly speaks for an unhinged demographic. Much like another American politician...
48.5;4;Head to Ali, FOUR runs battered through long-on, and England win by five wickets!;
48.4;?;Head to Ali, no run a yawning mow from Mo! Lucky not to lose his poles. Careful now;

47.4;1;Stoinis to Root, 1 run outside off, dabbed into the off side for another sharp single;

47.1;?;Stoinis to Root, no run cracked straight to cover;

42.4;?;Starc to Root, no run full again, driven hard to point;
42.3;W;Starc to Roy, OUT short, pulled, top-edged, gone! The end of a triumphant innings from Roy, the MCG rises as one to a brilliant performance.

41.3;?;Tye to Root, no run width, attempted square drive, nearly finds the edge!;
41.2;1;Tye to Roy, 1 run short and wide, cracked on the up but not timed. Matters not, as it plugs safe in the covers, well short of the boundary riders;
41.1;?;Tye to Roy, no run outside off, very full, stabbed through third man;

39.3;1;Tye to Root, 1 run full length, clipped to leg. Simple pickings;
39.2;2;Tye to Root, 2 runs on the pads, whipped square and finds the gap with ease to jog back for the second;

38.1;1;Starc to Root, 1 run chiselled out to the leg side;
37.6;2;Zampa to Roy, 2 runs tip and run into the covers, and what excellent running to turn one into two. He's matched his previous best against Sri Lanka at The Oval;
