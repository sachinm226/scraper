Umar Gul on to bowl, replacing Mohammad Asif
 Innings Start
Australia win by 36 runs and they are very much excited, hugs and hand shakes, well done, what a turnaround by Australia. Standing ovation for the Australian team. Now the Australian players shake hands with the Pakistan team. Smiles all around. Hauritz picks up five wickets for the innings. Take a moment to reflect on Pakistan team, they had dominated the game for 3 days and losing it on the 4th day is shattering. Yes the fielding was terrible on the 3rd day, catches being dropped but they only had to stay at the wicket today to get to that target, It is easy to write but to play out there is difficult. A fantastic match, exciting stuff.
Haddin: "We knew today, if we had got to 150, we could run it close. The boys did a great job and Hauritz bowled well, Siddle stuck it out there and he supported Hussey well".
Hughes: "To get a win first game after coming back to the team, is exciting, Hussey was excellent and Hauritz bowled well"
Yousuf: "We are disappointed, they batted well in the second innings, everyone tried hard, 175 was chaseable, one has to be positive and we should have won it. Siddle batted well and was inspiring. We surely will try our best for the next Test at Hobbart."
Ponting: "The wicket was challenging and the way the guys struck out was wonderful, the first half an hour would have told the story, how the game was going. we held on to our catches and the boys bowled well. Yousuf's wicket was massive and Haddin's catch was excellent, once we exposed the Pakistan tail the game was over. A great win for us and the boys will celebrate. Not many changes at Hobart and all of guys were terrific."
Hussey Man-of-the-Match: "Not finished as a Test cricketer, Siddle showed character and application.It is hard to think where to place this 100. It is hard to score a century, I will cherish this 100. In the first innings the pitch was difficult to bat on, it played well today. 175 was a tricky target, we were able to pick up quick wickets and that put them on the backfoot."
It was a fascinating game of Test cricket. We enjoyed bringing you the ball by ball commentary, hope you have enjoyed too. Thanks for all the emails. It was a pleasure reading them. Do join us for the third Test at Hobart. On behalf of David Walsh, Siddhartha Talya, Sanjay Murari and Gopi Rangarajan, this is Binoy George signing off.
