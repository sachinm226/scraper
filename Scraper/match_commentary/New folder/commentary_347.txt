Data
1.50pm: It's a good job Australia have George Bailey to provide the meat in their sandwich, else that effort would have been little more than two soggy slices of bread. Between England taking 4 for 57 at the top and 5 for 18 at the bottom, Bailey engineered partnerships of 67 with Adam Voges and 85 with Matthew Wade, meaning they do at least have a heap of beans to defend. Its quite a modest heap, however, and England should be favourites. But let's not get ahead of ourselves; Alex will be back in half an hour or so to see if the Aussie quicks can stick their oar in.
48.2;W;Tredwell to McKay, OUT tries to hit down the ground, grips a little and McKay gets an inside edge on to his pad, then through to disturb the stumps! Australia have been bowled out with 10 deliveries still on the shelf, England taking the last five wickets for 18 runs;Clint McKay b Tredwell 2 (12m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;

47.6;?;Rankin to McKay, no run sensible leave this time, gets a big stride in and lifts the bat high into the air;
47.5;?;Rankin to McKay, no run beats the outside edge again, this is too good for a No. 11, pitching in the channel and holding its line as McKay pokes forlornly at it;
47.4;?;Rankin to McKay, no run comes forward and gets bat on this, pushing into the covers;
47.3;?;Rankin to McKay, no run shortish, around off stump, defended;

47.1;?;Rankin to Coulter-Nile, no run tight line, slightly short of a length but too close to cut and Coulter-Nile hacks and misses;
46.6;?;Finn to McKay, no run slightly back of a length, rising steeply as McKay goes for a big ole straight drive, plays about two inches inside the line. Looked good, though;

45.2;W;Rankin to Bailey, OUT doesn't move the feet again, pushes and nicks off! Another one gone! Just a tickle of a feather of a scrape, Buttler went up immediately and it was just audible on the stump mic, umpire Ravi heard it too and Bailey, the redoubtable George Bailey, falls!;George Bailey c ?Buttler b Rankin 87 (138m 91b 5x4 3x6) SR: 95.6;
45.1;?;Rankin to Bailey, no run good length, outside off and Bailey prods at it unsuccessfully;
44.6;W;Tredwell to Johnson, OUT skids through the defences, bowled him!

42.2;W;Tredwell to Wade, OUT comes down the pitch, has another flamin' yahoo and gets a thick outside edge, which is plucked from the air at backward point. Wade goes and Carberry is the man with a smart catch! Respite for Tredwell, who continued to give the ball a bit of air, it dipped on Wade and he sliced a drive, looked like it might clear Carberry but he leapt like nimble-footed teenager and took it one-handed;Matthew Wade c Carberry b Tredwell 36 (54m 40b 3x4 0x6) SR: 90;

40.2;2;Root to Wade, 2 runs skips down the wicket, looking to menace the ball down the ground, completely miscues and the ball rolls through midwicket for a couple more;

29.6;W;Bopara to Voges, OUT bowled him, just tickled a bail and Bopara has struck! He is ecstatic, running off with a huge grin on his face, not quite sure what did for Voges there but he was through the shot early, attempting to pull a ball not quite short enough for the stroke, it passed under the blade and just nudged the woodwork. Maybe just skidded on a touch, rather than bouncing as much as usual, and sold Voges a dummy;Adam Voges b Bopara 30 (60m 52b 2x4 0x6) SR: 57.69;

26.3;2;Tredwell to Voges, 2 runs pushed through outside off, drops back and chops past the man on the edge of the circle at backward point, they get back for two;

13.4;?;Finn to Voges, no run full length delivery outside off, Voges leaves alone, that seamed back a little, not enough for Finn;
13.3;W;Finn to Clarke, OUT full, it nips back and strikes Clarke on the pad hanging back on his stumps, given out lbw Clarke has a chat with Bailey and decides to review. Was it going down? Was it too high? Umpire Ravi though it looked good. There's no bat on Hot Spot. Hawk Eye has it clipping the top of leg stump and that is good enough for umpire Ravi and England, Clarke goes, done by a delivery that seamed back in and the change back to Finn has worked but Clarke may feel a touch hard done by then;Michael Clarke lbw b Finn 22 (43m 28b 3x4 0x6) SR: 78.57;
13.2;2;Finn to Clarke, 2 runs pulled this time, not controlled again, this off the splice of the bat and it bloops wide of mid-on for a couple;

12.6;?;Stokes to Bailey, no run length on off stump, pushed into the covers;
12.5;W;Stokes to Marsh, OUT bouncer, surprise delivery, hooked at and Buttler takes it well above his head, has Marsh gloved this? Yes he has and Stokes makes the breakthrough. Good use of the bumper and it really hurried Marsh who was in no control of the hook which got up on him and brushed the glove, it flew high above Buttler's head but he leaped up with his right hand and made a smart grab;Shaun Marsh c ?Buttler b Stokes 25 (57m 40b 5x4 0x6) SR: 62.5;
12.4;1;Stokes to Clarke, 1 run length ball just nips back in a touch, Clarke cramped up on the crease but able to work down to long leg;

10.1;?;Stokes to Marsh, no run still two slips, full just outside off stump, pushed to mid-off;
9.6;?;Rankin to Clarke, no run back of a length at the body, Clarke blocks in the crease;
9.5;?;Rankin to Clarke, no run more sensible push into the covers from a tighter line on the same length;
9.4;?;Rankin to Clarke, no run full length and Clarke throws the kitchen sink at it two feet outside off, just stood still and aimed a huge waft at it down the ground, missed completely, that was wild;

7.2;?;Rankin to Clarke, no run back of a length at the body, tucked just short of short square leg, I think he's helmetted but no shin pads;
7.1;?;Rankin to Clarke, no run back of a length, defended going back on the stumps;
6.6;?;Finn to Marsh, no run shorter and Marsh cuts at it and misses, got a little excited with the length and tried to force it away a touch firmly really;
6.5;?;Finn to Marsh, no run tries to drive down the ground again but gets it off the inner half of the bat and Finn is able to field;
6.4;4;Finn to Marsh, FOUR runs drives past mid-off down the ground this time and with the short straight boundaries here at Cardiff that runs away for four;
6.3;?;Finn to Marsh, no run fuller and a good stride out of his ground and a well struck drive to mid-off;
6.2;?;Finn to Marsh, no run length ball on off stump, it shapes back a touch and clips the pad as Marsh shouldered arms, too high for an lbw appeal but a very good line that;
6.1;?;Finn to Marsh, no run full on off stump, forward and pushed up to mid-off;
5.6;?;Rankin to Clarke, no run another swing and a miss outside off, this more of a back foot slash rather than a square cut;

Seb: "That last over from Rankin! He's go to be in contention for an ashes spot!" Well that was certainly Anderson-esque, played around with the lengths wonderfully well and nailed his man...
 Innings Start
6.35pm: Phew, that was quite a match. You'll find Gnasher's more considered summary on the site shortly and we hope you'll join Alex and me for more and full-throttle fun and frolics from the Ageas Bowl on Monday. Thanks for your comments, as ever. Cheerio!
6.25pm: Time for the presentations... Starting with Australia captain, Michael Clarke: "England deserve a lot of credit, they bowled well this morning when the wicket was doing a bit, George Bailey batted really well but we didn't quite have enough. I was disappointed to lose 5 for 20 at the end and the way we bowled was the way we had to, to have a chance. Clint's bowling was terrific but we couldn't get over the line. We've all got to improve. [Shaun Marsh injury?] He might struggle for Monday, it doesn't look good. There's a lot to play for after a difficult Ashes so we're looking forward to trying to win the series."
England's captain, Eoin Morgan: "Absolutely, some hard fought cricket, we were a few down so me and Carbs dug in. Didn't expect it to move around all innings but they had to bowl length at the end. A lot of positives, Michael Carberry scored runs, which was great, Jos Buttler at the end and the bowlers did well. Carbs has got a great head on his shoulders, he's cool and calm. I'm feeling all right, good to get another innings. [Ben Stokes] has been playing really well and he's come up trumps. It's fantastic to see [the new guys] gel in the changing room. The pitch should be a belter down in Southampton so we're looking forward to it."
Despite Clint McKay's claims on the bubbly, Jos Buttler is named Man of the Match: "Definitely, great to be not out and the end and win. The knock at Old Trafford gave me a lot of confidence, so this is brilliant. That's my role [finishing games], so I want to play more like today. I've played a lot with Ben, it was good to be out there with him. We couldn't quite see the ball [on tight runs]. I think Johnson did me with a slower ball at the end and it just went straight up ... The ball has been going into the gloves nicely since the Champions Trophy, so great to continue."
6.15pm: It was always setting up to be nipper at the end but Buttler saw it big and served up the innings England needed, a sparkling 65 from 48 balls. It was a supremely well-paced knock, saving a mighty boosh or two for the end, when it was most needed; and it meant Clint McKay's stunning hat-trick was not the decisive act it looked like being. Carberry and Morgan steadied England with a century partnership but the 75 runs, in less than ten overs, added by Buttler and Stokes were pivotal. And, to the delight of the home support, it was Mitch Johnson who got whacked at the end. Cardiff has had some special finishes - Bairstow's debut, SL-NZ in the Champions Trophy - and this has been another to savour.
49.3;4;Johnson to Buttler, FOUR runs fullish, on the stumps and bunted straight back down the ground - that's four and Buttler has won it, a tense, sweaty three-wicket victory for England, which levels the series at 1-1 with one to play;
49.2;?;Johnson to Buttler, no run frees the arms again but can only dig this out to short midwicket;
49.1;6;Johnson to Buttler, SIX runs smashed it, absolutely SMASHED!! This is an awesome strike of the ball, Johnson went slightly full on middle and leg, Buttler wasn't to the pitch but managed to cart it absolutely miles, over deep midwicket, nearly into orbit above Cardiff and it drops into the crowd, swallowed up by the shadows lengthening over the stand;
48.6;1lb;McKay to Buttler, 1 leg bye drops short, Buttler plays across the line and misses, hits him in the midriff and rolls into the off side, they have to run and do, no direct hit and Buttler keeps the strike;
48.5;1;McKay to Tredwell, 1 run short and wide and pushed across, Tredwell throws the bat and bottom edges towards cover, they trot one;
48.4;?;McKay to Tredwell, no run back of a length, stays in the crease and defends;
48.3;?;McKay to Tredwell, no run dances down the track, swings his bat in the wind and misses a short ball outside off, sails through to Wade;
48.2;?;McKay to Tredwell, no run slightly full, on the stumps and punched towards mid-on, they decide not to chance it;
48.1;W;McKay to Stokes, OUT bowled him, played all around it! There's a twist yet... The ball just gripped a little, nibbling in off a length and hitting the top of leg stump, there was a gap between Stokes' bat and pad and he walks off shaking his head. McKay has four-for;Ben Stokes b McKay 25 (43m 29b 3x4 0x6) SR: 86.2;
47.6;2;Johnson to Buttler, 2 runs drops short again, Buttler pulls flat through square and they pick up another couple;
47.6;1w;Johnson to Buttler, 1 wide slung down the leg side, short and wide - huge cheers from the crowd;
47.5;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run full, tailing in and dug out to mid-on, sends Buttler back and a good job, as there's a direct hit, which they then decide to run on, Stokes scrambling to the danger end but it's Buttler who's in trouble, no one up to the stumps though and he gets in, the throw wayward. Drama!;
47.4;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run takes the pace off, gets across to defend;
47.3;4;Johnson to Stokes, FOUR runs another bumper, or more like half-tracker and Stokes treats this like a Sunday afternoon pie, swatting a muscular pull over mid-on and away to the boundary, easing the pressure further;
47.2;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run short and in the channel, defended down on to the wicket, no run;
47.1;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run slightly back of a length, sprayed across the right-hander, who dabs one through point;
46.6;?;McKay to Stokes, no run tries to close the gap and McKay goes short, beats the bat as Stokes swishes and misses;
46.5;?;McKay to Stokes, no run tight line around middle and leg, plunges forward to defend;
46.4;2lb;McKay to Stokes, 2 leg byes hits Stokes on the front pad and it deflects away through square, McKay is appealing for lbw but it must have pitched outside leg, probably hit outside the line too, they scamper hard and steal a couple more leg byes;
46.3;1;McKay to Buttler, 1 run again goes across and tucks a single to leg;
46.2;2;McKay to Buttler, 2 runs length, around off stump, works the ball off the body through square, they'll get back for two and that's a half-century for Buttler, his second of the series - played really well today;
46.1;?;McKay to Buttler, no run fullish, outside off and worked to midwicket - dot ball;
45.6;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run touch short, at the body, tucked into the leg side and Buttler will keep the strike;
45.5;6;Faulkner to Buttler, SIX runs and there's one of those hefty blows that England needed, Buttler sending the ball back over Faulkner's head, over the rope and all the way into the River Taff! A brutal blow from Buttler, who just stood still and hit through the line, it flew out of the screws, clearing the stand at long-on!;
45.4;1;Faulkner to Stokes, 1 run goes over the wicket, slightly short and outside the line, Stokes neatly runs it off the face, quite fine but third man keeps them to one;
45.3;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run tip and run towards mid-off, dives in but safe;
45.2;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run goes across his stumps and this bounces over the wicket as Buttler attempts to nudge off his hip - Wade holds his head in his hands;
45.1;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run dabbed short into the covers, Buttler sends Stokes back and he's nowhere near being home but the throw misses;
44.6;?;Watson to Stokes, no run darted across and beats the bat as Stokes pushes at it, Wade again half-appeals;
44.5;1;Watson to Buttler, 1 run in the channel, sits back and opens the face, glides one towards third man, they think about a second but elect against;
44.4;1;Watson to Stokes, 1 run bit of width, Stokes plays a back cut and, although he doesn't get it past point, they run one;
44.3;1;Watson to Buttler, 1 run back of a length, off-stump line, Buttler waits on it and nudges a single through square leg - that's the fifty partnership, and in good time;
44.2;1;Watson to Stokes, 1 run short again, this time Stokes is hit on the body but manages to get off strike;
44.1;?;Watson to Stokes, no run slightly short, over the top of the stumps and Stokes is tucked up, pulls and misses;
43.6;1;Faulkner to Stokes, 1 run comes forward, drops the ball short into the off side and they pick up one;
43.5;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run slightly back of a length, opens the face and steers to point;
43.4;2;Faulkner to Stokes, 2 runs drops short and Stokes pulls meatily in front of square, deep midwicket covers it but they get two;
43.3;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run gets on the front foot, can't beat the infield on the off side;
43.2;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run shorter, maybe a little pace off it, played off the back foot towards point;
43.1;?;Faulkner to Stokes, no run touch full of a length, outside off and driven straight to the man at cover;
42.6;1;Watson to Stokes, 1 run leans out and defends, an inside edge runs into the leg side for another single;
42.5;1;Watson to Buttler, 1 run pitched up outside off, pushed towards mid-on;
42.4;4;Watson to Buttler, FOUR runs he's done it again, another soft-handed glide for four fine of third man! Watson does not look happy but the crowd are bouncing;
42.3;4;Watson to Buttler, FOUR runs Buttler sits in the crease, opens the face and plays a late dab past the keeper, deliberate shot and it runs for four;
42.2;2;Watson to Buttler, 2 runs walks across his stumps and clips another length ball through backward square, has to dive to make a second this time;
42.1;2;Watson to Buttler, 2 runs down the leg side, tucked off the pads to fine leg, they get a comfortable two;
41.6;4;Johnson to Stokes, FOUR runs overpitched and straying down the leg side, Stokes glances it behind square and it bisects the two men in the deep - four!;
41.5;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run hammered into the deck and Stokes fails to connect on the pull - or does he? Johnson and Wade were convinced, it was a good take from the keeper but umpire Ravi is unmoved. Hot Spot suggesting there might have been a smudge of glove on that;
41.4;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run dug in short, Buttler pulls into the ground and the ball mooches through midwicket for one more;
41.3;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run good, tight line on off stump, Stokes gets forward and turns to leg;
41.2;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run waits in the crease and dabs a short ball down into the ground for a cheeky one;
41.1;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run full length outside off, gets an inside edge driving, the ball rolls in front of square on the leg side and Stokes has to reach for his ground as the throw bullets in after jogging the last few yards;
40.6;1;Faulkner to Stokes, 1 run over the wicket, shaping back on and clipped on the half-volley through square leg;
40.5;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run goes across and turns a single into the leg side;
40.4;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run tighter line and dug out on the full towards point;
40.3;4;Faulkner to Buttler, FOUR runs nicely played and Buttler picks up four, bit of width and he leans into an uppish drive through mid-off, finds the gap and that's another timely boundary;
40.2;?;Faulkner to Buttler, no run length ball kicks up a touch, Buttler drives and comes high off the bat towards cover;
40.1;2;Faulkner to Buttler, 2 runs angled in from round the wicket, works a couple to leg;
39.6;?;Johnson to Stokes, no run full and tailing in, bit of bat involved, I think, before it hits the pad as Johnson appeals;
39.5;4;Johnson to Stokes, FOUR runs short and wide and slashed hard and high, towards third man, Aaron Finch, who's a little slow in picking it up and then can't quite get there diving forwards, it bounces through him and away for four;
39.4;1;Johnson to Buttler, 1 run over the wicket, pitched up and clubbed through the covers, on the bounce to Marsh in the deep;
39.3;2;Johnson to Buttler, 2 runs stays back, opens the face and guides the ball low, off the outside half of the bat past slip, looks like it will beat third man but Faulkner throws himself like a last action hero and claws it back from the rope - sooper work;
39.2;2;Johnson to Buttler, 2 runs slightly overpitched, in the channel outside off, Buttler leans into a well-timed drive through cover, the sweeper has to go to his right and they get two;
39.1;1;Johnson to Stokes, 1 run low full toss veering towards leg stump, just needs a tickle on it for a single to fine leg;
38.6;4lb;Faulkner to Buttler, 4 leg byes round the wicket, slightly back of a length and the ball flicks the pad, loops past Wade and will run away for useful byes;
38.5;1;Faulkner to Stokes, 1 run Faulkner goes over the wicket to the left-hander and there's a shout first ball, as Stokes plays around his pad, Bailey isn't interested this time and it's signalled as a run, the ball rolling into the on side;
38.4;W;Faulkner to Bopara, OUT Bopara drives, beaten on the inside and hit in front - given! And this one isn't worth reviewing, Bopara's painful stay is ended, he never managed to find his sea legs and was stuck on the crease, struck just in line with off stump and the ball would have decapitated middle;Ravi Bopara lbw b Faulkner 7 (36m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 36.84;
38.3;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run pushed towards mid-off, tip and run but they're safely home;
38.2;1;Faulkner to Bopara, 1 run turns a length ball off his pads short on the leg side, they think about a second but won't get it as deep square runs in;
38.1;1;Faulkner to Buttler, 1 run plays with the bat away from the front pad, inside-edging to backward square leg;
37.6;1;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run slightly overpitched, on the stumps and on-driven into the ground, back past the bowler and mid-on slithers across to intercept;
37.5;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run good length in the channel, comes forward and taps into the covers;
37.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, no run gets on the front foot and drives firmly but straight to mid-off;
37.3;1;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, 1 run opens himself up and makes room for an almighty smite, gets a thick outside edge and it sails over a vacant third slip to third man on the bounce;
37.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run outside off, slightly full and pushed towards mid-off on the front foot;
37.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run another edge, another life for Bopara, this time the ball dropping short and bouncing into Wade's gloves! On the plus side for Australia, Wade caught it;
36.6;1;Watson to Bopara, 1 run full length, outside off and driven wristily through the covers to the sweeper;
36.5;1;Watson to Buttler, 1 run length ball, attacking the stumps again, little more leg side and it runs away off the pad towards square;
36.4;?;Watson to Buttler, no run seaming in and Buttler is hit on the pads again, this time Bailey gives it! After a brief discussion, they ask for the review, there's no doubt on height but Watson was slightly wide on the crease, could be heading down leg ... and that's what Hawk-Eye says, missing leg stump and the decision is overturned. Bailey blots his copybook but the Buttler survives;
36.3;?;Watson to Buttler, no run length ball, on off stump, stands tall and closes the face to turn to midwicket, where it's well stopped, Bopara has to get back;
36.2;1;Watson to Bopara, 1 run Bopara plays across the line, runs off the leading edge through cover;
36.1;3;Watson to Buttler, 3 runs drops short and Buttler paddles a pull shot between mid-on and midwicket, kept it down well but the ball is running into the corner of the ground and won't reach the rope as Faulkner gives chase;
35.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run gets across to a length ball outside off, dabs towards point - another dot;
35.5;1;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 run gets on the front foot and pushes short of mid-off, they're able to scamper one;
35.4;4;Coulter-Nile to Buttler, FOUR runs that's a beautiful stroke from Buttler, minimal stride forward and hitting on the up, laces a cover drive through the infield for four;
35.3;1;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, 1 run angling in from outside the line of off again, gets a bit of bat on this and squirts to backward square;
35.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run hit on the back leg, seaming in off a length but a touch high, above the pads;
35.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Bopara, no run length ball outside off, comes forward and steers towards point;
34.6;?;Watson to Buttler, no run comes forward and dabs the ball into the off side, no run - another over tighter than a pair of Kylie's hotpants from Watson;
34.5;?;Watson to Buttler, no run beats the bat, little bit of nibble off a length and Buttler goes fishing;
34.4;?;Watson to Buttler, no run full, almost yorker length and Buttler misses trying to clip to leg, hits front then back pad ... but Bailey again shakes his head. Hawk-Eye shows it would have just missed leg stump - another good decision;
34.3;?;Watson to Buttler, no run gets a stride in and pushes a fullish ball into the off side;
34.2;?;Watson to Buttler, no run in the channel and nipping back, Buttler judges where his off stump is well and lets it go;
34.1;1;Watson to Bopara, 1 run length ball, around off and punched wide of mid-on for a single;
33.6;W;Coulter-Nile to Carberry, OUT bowled him, behind the legs - Carberry's done for this time! Nathan Coulter-Nile has his first ODI wicket and it's a dismissal we don't see all that often, Carberry has been walking across his stumps all innings, tried to flick a length ball off his hips and misses it, off popped the bails;Michael Carberry b Coulter-Nile 63 (147m 95b 7x4 0x6) SR: 66.31;
33.5;4;Coulter-Nile to Carberry, FOUR runs drives hard off the back foot, playing away from his body and edged hard and high and past Wade's fingertips - would have been a sensational catch but he couldn't quite get there, instead it's a boundary!;
33.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Carberry, no run shortish, defended on the back foot;
33.3;2;Coulter-Nile to Carberry, 2 runs starts to walk down the track again, pitched up and crunched off the pads, in the air for a bit and spinning, bouncing towards deep square leg, where it's well stopped;
33.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Carberry, no run pushed across in the corridor outside off, deflects the ball to backward point;
33.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Carberry, no run full toss on leg stump, Carberry fails to cash in, though, tamely clipping the ball to midwicket;
32.6;?;Watson to Bopara, no run there's another appeal as Bopara attempts a risky dab into the off side, too close even for a late cut and there's a sound as the ball went through but must have been thigh pad, as the appeal quickly dies in Australian throats;
