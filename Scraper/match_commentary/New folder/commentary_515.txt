Data
Brilliant finish, Australia were completely stuck until Hussey and Marsh took the Powerplay in the 39th over. Suddenly they found their range and England panicked. It was breathless stuff and it's set up what should be an enthralling run chase.
Brydon Coverdale has furiously typed out his bulletin to tell you more, so check that out.

25.5;2;Wright to Paine, 2 runs played with very soft hands by Paine, defending and it came off the outside edge, ran down to third man where Broad slides well to field, and somehow keep it to two, should have been a third there;

17.1;1;Wright to Paine, 1 run solidly forward, punched to cover;
16.6;W;Broad to Ponting, OUT short again, and that's the big breakthrough that England needed!

14.2;?;Broad to Paine, no run snorter! That one utterly flew off a good length. Paine whips his gloves, neck, bat, everything, inside the line;
14.1;1;Broad to Ponting, 1 run clipped up and out to square leg.;
13.6;?;Anderson to Paine, no run attempted late steer through point, but can't get the angle. Good over for England's purposes;

13.4;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run tucked up by a hint of movement back off the track.;

12.1;1;Broad to Paine, 1 run tucked off the hip to midwicket;
11.6;?;Bresnan to Ponting, no run what on earth was that? A filthy flat-footed mow, just as I was singing his stylish praises. No contact, and for Ponting's sake, that's just as well;
11.5;4;Bresnan to Ponting, FOUR runs sublime. There's no stopping that. Eases into a flicked on-drive as Bresnan strays a touch. He's ticking now;

11.3;?;Bresnan to Ponting, no run punched into the covers off the back foot this time;
11.2;3;Bresnan to Paine, 3 runs chipped in the air and through the gap at midwicket. A touch lucky, maybe? I suppose he found the gap well enough;
11.1;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run drawn forward, and deflected down to gully. Good line;
10.6;4;Broad to Ponting, FOUR runs cracking strike to finish the over, just enough width and Ponting leathers it off the back foot, through the covers. No stopping that;
10.5;?;Broad to Ponting, no run outside off this time, Ponting unfurls his best Test-match leave-alone to usher that one through. Bat high, front knee bent, you know the drill;
10.5;1w;Broad to Ponting, 1 wide oops, that's a bit misdirected. Wa-ay down the leg side;
10.4;?;Broad to Ponting, no run back and across, and defended to midwicket;
10.3;1;Broad to Paine, 1 run overpitched a fraction outside off, pushed into the covers and they turn down a risky two. Ponting glares at Paine for a hesitant call;
10.2;?;Broad to Paine, no run fuller and attacking the top of off. Dabbed into the leg side and they scamper through;
10.1;?;Broad to Paine, no run good length outside off, climbing through to the keeper. No stroke;
9.6;?;Bresnan to Ponting, no run left alone outside off to finish the Powerplay. Good summary of it really.;

8.6;?;Broad to Ponting, no run Broad goes full first up, almost yorker length and dug out by Ponting;
8.5;W;Broad to Watson, OUT Broad strikes! Watson departs and after all the hard work he's put in, this is a bit of a soft dismissal. Short ball on about off stump, Watson cracked a pull shot straight to mid on.;Shane Watson c Anderson b Broad 14 (34m 26b 3x4 0x6) SR: 53.84;
8.4;?;Broad to Watson, no run fuller and Watson rocks forward into a full-blooded forward defence;
8.3;?;Broad to Watson, no run this time Broad reverts to a better line outside off, and Watson plays at this, which suggests a change of mentality, but it's only a defence;
8.2;4;Broad to Watson, FOUR runs shot! Watson made this look so easy, it was a fraction short and in a flash he thwacked it through midwicket;
8.1;?;Broad to Watson, no run well, new bowler, same result, outside off stump and left alone;
7.6;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run no strike-stealing single here, Paine instead blocks off the front foot;

7.2;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run good response from Bresnan, drags the length back a fraction and Paine plays and misses outside off;
7.1;4;Bresnan to Paine, FOUR runs that will do his confidence some good, not perfectly timed, but Paine gets an overpitched ball from Bresnan, and drives through the covers for four;
6.6;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run ooh, pressure almost doing for Paine there, he skipped down the wicket, Anderson dropped it short, Paine pulled and found a top-edge that looped one-bounce to fine leg;
6.5;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run good run here, Australia probably need a few more of these, Watson dabs it into the leg side and scampers through for one;
6.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run Watson plays at this, but it's a forward defence;
6.3;?;Anderson to Watson, no run well, this really is English one-day cricket, hard graft at the top of the order, Watson leaves once more from a ball the came back at him;
6.2;?;Anderson to Watson, no run Watson leaves outside off, with a touch of flourish it must be said, holding the pose for a while;
6.1;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run close there, almost squeezed through, Paine was defending with no foot movement and it got an inside edge down to fine leg for one;
5.6;1;Bresnan to Paine, 1 run Paine once again nicks the strike, guiding it neatly to third man for one;
5.5;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run Paine leans forward into a forward defence and it goes gently into the off side;
5.4;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run another slightly nervy defence, Paine leans half forward and it runs off the outer half of the bat;
5.3;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run Paine is really struggling here, beaten outside off stump and he looks very tentative, leaning forward to defend but missing;
5.2;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run this time it's played a touch more certainly as he defends;
5.1;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run Bresnan continues to probe around off stump, Paine leaves alone;

4.5;?;Anderson to Watson, no run very solid defence from Watson, thrusting forward and full-facing it to cover;
4.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run this time it's outside off and Watson lets it go once again;
4.3;?;Anderson to Watson, no run good from Anderson here, jagging it down the slope and cramping Watson as he tries to defend;
4.2;?;Anderson to Watson, no run Anderson drags his length back, which is wise against Watson, and it's left alone;
4.1;3;Anderson to Paine, 3 runs nicely played by Paine there, Anderson went full, testing to see if there is any swing about - there isn't - Paine leant it past mid on for three;
3.6;1;Bresnan to Paine, 1 run Paine keeps the strike, unfortunately for Australia, dabbing a single to mid on;
3.5;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run this time Paine connects, quietly defending;
3.5;1w;Bresnan to Paine, 1 wide another play and miss outside off, but this was a touch too wide for the umpire's liking;
3.4;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run oh dear, that looked a touch desperate, Paine gave himself room outside leg, aimed a big scythe over cover but swished only at thin air;
3.3;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run Bresnan continues to hold a decent off-stump line, and there is not much Paine seems able to do, just defending, pressure building on him again;
3.2;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run this time it moves away and beats Paine on the outside edge;
3.1;?;Bresnan to Paine, no run good stuff from Bresnan, finding a bit of nibble off the pitch, this time into Paine, who shoulders arms;
2.6;?;Anderson to Watson, no run quieter finish to the over, outside off once more and Watson leaves alone;
2.5;?;Anderson to Watson, no run well, what happened here!? It was a zipping shortish ball around off stump, Watson tried to cut but extra bounce cramped him for room there was a sound as it passed the bat, massive appeal from England but Aleem Dar rules not out;
2.4;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs and again! Didn't time it perfectly but it does not matter at all, short from Anderson, Watson latches on to the pull shot for a second boundary;
2.3;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs that's better! Watson has seen enough of this back-of-a-length tactic and pulls off the front foot, powering it through midwicket for four;
2.2;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run Paine is away, in unspectacular fashion, getting into line and skewing an inside edge off his back-foot defence for a single behind square on the leg side;
2.1;?;Anderson to Paine, no run Anderson continues the good work, moving the ball into Paine once more, the batsman left it on length, which I always like to see;

Looked very close that shout, but the many many replays can't decide either way, so probably a decent decision. Big sound though.
 Innings Start
Australia have come back very strongly from 3-0 down - they've beaten England comfortably in the last two games. It was Mike Hussey and Shaun Marsh's partnership that first turned the game towards Australia, but Shaun Tait nailed home the advantage. His opening burst was as exciting as anything I've seen in a long time. It left England feeling anxious and they never quite recovered, despite Collingwood's defiant 95.
England do of course take the series, but ahead of the Ashes there was enough for both teams to take with them to Brisbane.
Brydon will have his bulletin ready for you soon, so check that out. And for the visually minded we have a gallery of the best of the day's action.
Michael Atherton leads the presentation ceremony. Ponting dead-bats Atherton's invitation to speculate about Tait's Test future and rightly praises his side for coming back so strongly in the series.
Shaun Tait is named man of the match he really deserved it. From his interview he looks like a man with more pace than words and is surprisingly soft-spoken. He too has none of Atherton's invitation to turn his Test retirement around, saying he struggles enough to get through 10 overs in an ODI game.
Eoin Morgan is man of the series. Like Tait he's a man of few words but says, somewhat predictably, that he would was disappointed not to contribute more in England's last two games.
That's about it from us. There is of course plenty more cricket going around and Australia are back in action against Pakistan on Monday.
46.3;W;Tait to Swann, OUT that'll be all! Tait finishes it off, which is apt, with a slower ball, which isn't! Swann backed away and tried to carve it over mid off but he couldn't time it and ended up gifting a catch to mid off.;Graeme Swann c Harris b Tait 33 (21m 21b 5x4 0x6) SR: 157.14;

42.5;1;Tait to Swann, 1 run Swann more comfortable here, nudging to square leg for a single;
42.4;?;Tait to Swann, no run ooh, this only missed by a fraction, it was full, very fast and swinging in late to Swann, narrowly missing off stump;

40.5;?;Tait to PD Collingwood, no run back of a length and cut firmly to point;

38.6;?;Bollinger to Bresnan, no run half-volley wide of off but Bresnan can't make anything of it, driving straight to mid-off. The fielder was deep, but he hit it too hard to allow a single;

30.2;W;Smith to Wright, OUT Wright slogs sweeps and makes a good connection ... but Shaun Marsh charges round at deep midwicket to take his second superb running catch in the deep. He held this one much more cleanly, and as Smith picks up his second wicket you've got to be thinking this might be it for England.;Luke Wright c Marsh b Smith 21 (45m 37b 1x4 0x6) SR: 56.75;
30.1;1;Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run tapped down to long-on for one;

26.5;?;Tait to Wright, no run Tait is probably a little fortunate this wasn't called a wide, arrowed down the leg side;
26.4;?;Tait to Wright, no run good ball this, fuller and straighter and Wright defends;
26.3;?;Tait to Wright, no run he may not have the rhythm of his earlier spell, but still a decent pace being generated, Wright bottom-edges his attempted cut;
26.2;1;Tait to PD Collingwood, 1 run touch short and a touch wide, Collingwood cuts firmly, but deep point keeps it to one;
26.1;4;Tait to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs he's been fearful so far today, but this time Tait dishes up a cuddly leg-stump slower-ball full toss that Collingwood clips for four round the corner;
25.6;?;Hopes to Wright, no run bouncer to finish the over, Wright crouches under it;
25.5;2;Hopes to Wright, 2 runs this is excellently played by Wright, really good shot, couple of steps down the wicket, gave himself a bit of room , but didn't try to overhit his cover drive, instead timing it nicely for a couple;
25.4;4;Hopes to Wright, FOUR runs that'll help, again, not quite as planned, big pull shot aimed but it gets a top edge and sails over Paine for four;
25.3;?;Hopes to Wright, no run pressure building on Wright, just finding the fielders a touch;
25.2;?;Hopes to Wright, no run feeding Wright's cut shot, and it's played very well, but straight to the fielder at point;
25.1;?;Hopes to Wright, no run big appeal from Hopes, though it was a touch, err, optimistic from him, thudding into the pads but heading down leg;
24.6;6;Tait to PD Collingwood, SIX runs Collingwood has fifty! Not sure how much he knew about it, banged in short from Tait, Collingwood on the hook, flies off a top edge all the way over the fine leg boundary;
24.5;?;Tait to PD Collingwood, no run it's a quieter start from Tait, the match tension has gone slightly, he bowled a four-over spell first up which may have tired him, still fairly rapid though;
24.4;?;Tait to PD Collingwood, no run a play and a miss, full and asking for a drive, Collingwood answers the call but can't connect;
24.3;?;Tait to PD Collingwood, no run touch shorter and enough width outside off, left well alone;
24.2;?;Tait to PD Collingwood, no run cranking up his pace a bit already, Collingwood aims a cut and it's through him before he can lay bat on ball;

23.5;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood drives crisply but again finds a leaping and diving Hussey;
23.4;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run ooh, big edge on this, but it was a slower ball and bounced a couple of times through to Paine;
23.3;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run neatly blocked back to the bowler;
23.2;1;Hopes to Wright, 1 run touch of width allows Wright to slap it through point but there is a fielder set deep;
23.1;?;Hopes to Wright, no run not much happening for the batsmen, maybe they should think about using the Powerplay, it worked wonders for Australia;
22.6;1;Smith to Wright, 1 run calmly pushed down the ground for a single;
22.5;1;Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run nice played, skipping down the track and clipped away for a single in front of midwicket;

22.3;2;Smith to PD Collingwood, 2 runs Collingwood gets forward and pushes through extra cover;
22.2;1;Smith to Wright, 1 run single here nudged into the leg side;
22.1;?;Smith to Wright, no run "bowled Stevie," says Tim Paine, and it was, flighted and drawing a forward defence;
21.6;1;Hopes to Wright, 1 run better from Wright, solidly forward but pushing past the bowler to milk one;
21.5;1;Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run Collingwood is happy to push a single down the ground;
21.4;1;Hopes to Wright, 1 run England aren't really going anywhere here, this time it's short, Wright is back trying to find a big hook shot, but it top-edges meekly, one-bounce to fine leg;
21.3;?;Hopes to Wright, no run Hopes is doing a great job, giving nothing away, Wright blocks;
21.2;?;Hopes to Wright, no run this time Wright is defending off the back foot, and doing it very solidly;
21.1;?;Hopes to Wright, no run Wright is doing his best Test batting impression, presenting a pendulum-straight bat;
20.6;1;Smith to Wright, 1 run slashed hard into the point region, the pace is taken off by a fielder so it's only one;
20.5;?;Smith to Wright, no run Wright is carefully forward and blocking;
20.4;?;Smith to Wright, no run Wright is once again forward and defending. Even Tim Paine, the man with the world's most gentle face, seems to be having a fearful sledge;
20.3;1;Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run nicely milked down the ground by Collingwood;
20.2;1;Smith to Wright, 1 run picks out a single here, full-facing into the cover region;
20.1;?;Smith to Wright, no run big innings this for Wright, he hasn't batted well this series and has plenty of time to do so here, blocks this studiously off the front foot;
19.6;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run fuller from Hopes and Collingwood's drive can't pierce the infield;
19.5;2;Hopes to PD Collingwood, 2 runs gets this away though, pushing through point for a couple;
19.4;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run good save this, driven firmly but Hussey dives at short extra;
19.3;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run suddenly this has a darkly familiar feeling for England, Australia dominant, Collingwood digging desperately;
19.2;1;Hopes to Wright, 1 run short and wide, feeding Wright's most comfortable stroke - the off side slash - but there is a deep point in place;

18.6;1;Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run punched out to deep cover for the single;
18.5;?;Smith to PD Collingwood, no run slashed but straight to backward point;
18.4;?;Smith to PD Collingwood, no run very optimistic appeal from 'keeper and bowler as the ball strikes pad, but there was a massive inside edge on that;
18.3;?;Smith to PD Collingwood, no run full and flighted, Collingwood lunges forward to defend;
18.2;?;Smith to PD Collingwood, no run driven to mid-off;
18.1;3;Smith to Wright, 3 runs men at silly mid-off and slip, and so a huge gap at extra cover which Wright finds with a cracking drive. But there is a deep cover, and he cuts if off;
17.6;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run back of a length to finish, Collingwood defends;
17.5;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run once again nothing on offer for Collingwood, he defends quietly;
17.4;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run Hopes doing a fine job here, Collingwood can't beat the infield;
17.3;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run hint of width this time, Collingwood tries to guide it to third man, but can't beat point;
17.2;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run much fuller this time, Collingwood pops forward to drive, but it skews off the inside half of the bat;
17.1;?;Hopes to PD Collingwood, no run touch short, Collingwood aims to cut, but can't find any timing;
16.6;?;Smith to Wright, no run Wright defends with an inside edge;
16.5;W;Smith to Pietersen, OUT gone! Maybe that thigh won't get much of a testing then. It was short and slightly wide, Pietersen went back to cut but ends up with a bottom edge on to his foot which goes on to the stumps leaving England in a bit of a mess;Kevin Pietersen b Smith 0 (2m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
16.4;?;Smith to Pietersen, no run gets into a good position here, stretching forward and driving crisply to cover;
16.3;?;Smith to Pietersen, no run Pietersen has to stretch forward first ball, that thigh will get a severe working over;
16.2;1;Smith to PD Collingwood, 1 run this time Collingwood turns it into the leg side to bring Pietersen on to strike;
16.1;?;Smith to PD Collingwood, no run tidy start, gentle spin away Collingwood defends;
15.6;?;Hopes to Pietersen, no run bouncer to greet the new man, outside off and he leaves alone;
15.5;W;Hopes to Morgan, OUT gone! What a catch! Morgan nailed a pull shot, smashing it flat towards a straightish midwicket, the Marsh in the deep ran round and dived, juggling the ball as he landed to clasp on to the catch;Eoin Morgan c Marsh b Hopes 9 (36m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 50;
15.4;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run this would keep the bowler interested, outside off stump and Morgan just let his hands follow the ball;
15.3;2;Hopes to Morgan, 2 runs follows up the boundary with a neat tickle round the corner for two more;
15.2;4;Hopes to Morgan, FOUR runs lovely shot this, he's been very patient to begin with but now Morgan skips down the wicket, gives himself a bit of room and drives wristily through the covers for four;
15.1;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run this is on a good length and line to welcome Morgan back after the break, defended to cover;
14.6;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run driven to mid-off once again, a slightly better connection but straight to the fielder;
14.5;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run driven to mid-off, but not timed;
14.4;1;Bollinger to Morgan, 1 run pushed just between midwicket and the wide mid-on, and they take a sharp single;
14.3;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run on a length, seaming in and tucked straight to midwicket;
14.2;4lb;Bollinger to Morgan, 4 leg byes sharp bouncer! And perfectly directed, Morgan aimed to hook it up and over fine leg but took his eyes off the ball, which took the top edge and touched the shoulder and the bottom of the helmet, flying up and over slip and 'keeper and away for four. Dougie's not pleased, but a moral victory for him;
14.1;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run Bollinger bangs one in outside off, Morgan drops his hands and leaves;
13.6;1;Hopes to Morgan, 1 run tapped out to wide long-on for another easy single;
13.6;1w;Hopes to Morgan, 1 wide pushed too far down leg, that's a wide;
13.5;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run Hopes pulls the length back slightly, and again the ball is pushed defensively to cover;
13.4;?;Hopes to Morgan, no run a touch of movement away off the seam, but Morgan spots it and defends towards cover;
13.3;1;Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run tapped easily to deep mid-on for an ambled single;
13.2;1;Hopes to Morgan, 1 run nudged gently off the hip, and they charge through for one as Hopes sprints across after his follow-through;
13.1;1;Hopes to PD Collingwood, 1 run edged first ball! But that fell just short, and wide, of Watson at slip. Half a chance, but it didn't get to him.;
12.6;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run on a length, and coming in off the seam. Morgan responds with a solid forward defensive, presenting the full face of a straight bat;
12.5;1;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run full, and clipped out to deep midwicket. They briefly consider a second;
12.4;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run back of a length and straight, Collingwood hops back and across to defend;
12.3;1lb;Bollinger to Morgan, 1 leg bye sharp yorker! Morgan is struck on the foot to cries of anguish from the Australian fielders, but that was slipping way down leg;
12.3;1w;Bollinger to Morgan, 1 wide left-hander messes up the radar as he spears one down the leg side;
12.2;1;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run much fuller this time, prodded defensively to midwicket, and they take a quick single;
12.1;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run short and quick from Bollinger, not the best directed bouncer, but it beats Collingwood's swivel-pull on its way through to Tim Paine. Umpire lets him know "that's one for the over";
11.6;1;Harris to PD Collingwood, 1 run tip-and-run to finish the over, as the ball is pushed into the tiniest of gaps at cover and they set off immediately for a single. Nice running;
11.5;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run hmm, has that kept low? It was on a length outside off and Collingwood aimed to slash it away, but the ball zipped under the bat;
11.4;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run full and straight this time, Collingwood tries to nurdle to leg but finds mid-on;
11.3;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run driven on the up, but again straight to cover;
11.2;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run pulls the length back a touch, and Collingwood pushes to cover;
11.1;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run ball squirts off the inside edge, going to cover as it rebounds off the pad. Morgan wants a run but Collingwood sends him back. A direct hit would've had him there;
10.6;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run now he gets one to jag in to the left-hander off the seam, and the ball is tapped defensively to point with a hop;
10.5;?;Bollinger to Morgan, no run back of a length outside off, rising nicely up to about chest height and Morgan leaves alone;
10.4;1;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run full and slightly wider, Collingwood tries a drive but isn't in a great position and the ball skews to cover;
10.3;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run pushed across Collingwood, who pulls his bat out of the way and leaves again;
10.2;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run big appeal from Bollinger as he shapes one back in to the right-hander to strike him on the pad. But it pitched just on leg, and was going way over the top of off, so an optimistic appeal.;
10.1;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run wobbling around outside off, Collingwood is quite happy to leave alone;
9.6;1;Harris to PD Collingwood, 1 run pushed just to the right of mid on, giving them opportunity for a quick single;
9.5;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run full on off, tapped back to the bowler;
9.4;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run slipping down towards leg stump, that was there to be hit but Collingwood couldn't lay bat on ball. Perhaps beaten slightly for pace as ball strikes pad;
9.3;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run pushed behind square, but straight to backward point;
9.2;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run little bit of movement away through the air, Collingwood defends a very full ball somewhat awkwardly and the ball rolls into the off side;
9.1;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run driven firmly to cover;
8.6;1;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 run well, Collingwood wasn't content to just play out the over! He charges down the track to the last ball and aims a massive heave over midwicket. Can't quite connect though, and the ball trickles behind square;
8.5;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run and again, he's done his work for the over and so can leave deliveries in the channel outside off without a worry;
8.4;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run landing just outside off from over the wicket, and Collingwood leaves alone;
8.3;4;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs Bollinger directs one at leg stump and Collingwood rolls his wrists nicely over the ball to send it to the long leg boundary. Nice shot, didn't hit it too hard but got the timing and placement spot on;
8.2;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run same again, although this time Collingwood was expecting the extra bounce and got up on his toes to play the ball down to point;
8.1;?;Bollinger to PD Collingwood, no run nice start, Bollinger finds some lift outside off to strike the splice of Collingwood's bat;
7.6;?;Harris to Morgan, no run full to start, and Morgan taps the ball back to Harris;
7.5;W;Harris to Kieswetter, OUT leading edge flies to Hussey at extra cover, and Kieswetter departs! Harris had been shaping the ball away from him nicely, and as Kieswetter shaped to clip through midwicket the movement got him into trouble. The ball flew quickly to Hussey's right, but he timed his leap perfectly to snatch it out of mid air. Australia are right on top now!;Craig Kieswetter c Hussey b Harris 11 (39m 23b 1x4 0x6) SR: 47.82;
7.4;2;Harris to Kieswetter, 2 runs too straight to follow up, and he's flicked down to fine leg where a tumbling stop saves a few runs;
7.3;4;Harris to Kieswetter, FOUR runs wonderful shot from Kieswetter, textbook cover drive played on the up through cover. Not a half-volley, but cracked right out of the middle with a high left elbow, and he picks the gap perfectly too;
7.2;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run just back of a length on off stump, Kieswetter gets on top of the ball and taps to point. Played it right under his eyes;
7.1;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run full and punched firmly into the covers;
6.6;?;Tait to PD Collingwood, no run inside edge squirts just past the stumps and straight to the man at short fine leg! That was mighty close, but no harm done in the end;
6.5;?;Tait to PD Collingwood, no run full and straight, pushed to mid on;
6.5;1w;Tait to PD Collingwood, 1 wide Collingwood shuffles across to off as Tait hurls one down the leg side - that's a wide;
6.4;?;Tait to PD Collingwood, no run fuller this time, and the ball is met with the full face of the bat in a defensive stroke;
6.3;6;Tait to PD Collingwood, SIX runs pulled infront of square for six! That was anything but a nurdle, Tait drops short and Collingwood just rocks back and scythes through the line to send the ball sailing over the boundary;
6.2;4;Tait to PD Collingwood, FOUR runs even at Tait's pace, you can't afford to dish up a delivery like that. Ful and wide, and slapped past backward point for four;
6.1;2;Tait to PD Collingwood, 2 runs on a length, but just too straight and Collingwood goes back and across, very deep in the crease, to work the ball away behind square on the leg side;
5.6;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run banged in outside off, Kieswetter whips his bat out of the way and leaves well alone;
5.5;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run quick yorker from Harris, Kieswetter does well to keep it out;
5.4;3;Harris to PD Collingwood, 3 runs too straight from Harris, and Collingwood nurdles one right out of the middle down to the midwicket boundary. Long boundary there, so a tough chase for the fielder, who does eventually haul it in;
5.3;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run and again, Harris shapes the ball away to beat the edge of Collingwood's prod. To the batsman's credit, he didn't push at the ball, just played the line;
5.2;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run Collingwood pushes leaden-footed at a length delivery outside off and is well beaten;
5.1;?;Harris to PD Collingwood, no run full and wide outside off, swinging away and left alone by Collingwood;
4.6;3;Tait to PD Collingwood, 3 runs woah! Full and fast, Colly jams the bat down just in time to keep the ball out, and sends the ball into the gap on the leg side;
4.5;W;Tait to Yardy, OUT nope. I don't know what the thinking was sending Yardy in to face Tait, but it really hasn't worked. Tait fires one in fuller and Yardy simply leaves it - I don't think he quite picked the ball up - and the ball smashes into the stumps. There was a slight deflection off the pad, but that was full and straight. Tait strikes again!;Michael Yardy b Tait 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
4.5;1w;Tait to Yardy, 1 wide speared down the leg side, that's a wide. So Yardy will have to face up to that delivery again...;
4.4;4b;Tait to Yardy, 4 byes cuts him in half! I don't think Yardy even saw that, it was right through him before he could even get the bat down. Paine is done by the speed too, and that runs down to fine leg!;
4.3;W;Tait to Strauss, OUT clatter! That's the dismissal every fast bowler wants to see! Tait fires one in on a length, gets some nice shape in to the left-hander to beat his defensive poke and smash into the top of the off stump. That's a real statement: the stump cartwheels out of the ground. First strike for Australia;Andrew Strauss b Tait 6 (20m 11b 1x4 0x6) SR: 54.54;
4.2;?;Tait to Strauss, no run slower ball, but slips out a full toss outside off and Strauss taps to mid-off;
4.1;4;Tait to Strauss, FOUR runs short and sharp from Tait, but he's offered width outside off and Strauss uppercuts down to third man. Such was the pace on the ball, it landed just inside the boundary rope!;
3.6;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run solid defensive stroke to backward point. That hit the middle, nice crack of bat on ball;
3.5;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run after swinging a couple away from the bat, he gets one to jag in off the seam. Kieswetter is hurried in defence, and the ball shoots off the inner half of the bat to midwicket;
3.4;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run squirted defensively to gully off the front foot;
3.3;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run now he's hit one! Middles a drive, but straight to cover. Sharp fielding there, it was really well struck;
3.2;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run and again! Same ball, same shot, and the result is identical: he hit's nought but fresh air;
3.1;?;Harris to Kieswetter, no run Kieswetter has a huge swipe to the first ball, which is full outside off, and misses completely;
2.6;?;Tait to Strauss, no run feisty! Well-directed bouncer on middle and off, Strauss buckles the knees to get underneath it. Phew! That's nasty;
2.5;2;Tait to Strauss, 2 runs Strauss shuffles right across to off stump and clips Tait down to fine leg. The pace on the ball means the fielder has to pull out the dive to cut it off;
2.4;1;Tait to Kieswetter, 1 run nicely played by Kieswetter, the ball shaped away from him off a length but he got on top of it for a single to third man;
2.3;?;Tait to Kieswetter, no run full again, punched to cover;
2.2;2;Tait to Kieswetter, 2 runs banged in short, ball hits bat as Kieswetter tries to hook but luckily for him it loops safely behind square leg;
2.1;?;Tait to Kieswetter, no run full, fast and swinging, but Kieswetter drives nicely to mid-off. Beaten for pace though, he only moved forward after the shot had already been played;
1.6;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run beaten on the outside edge! In the channel outside off, close enough that Strauss had to play this time, but the movement takes the ball past the edge.;
1.5;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run he's expecting it to move now, and as Bollinger sends one down on a length outside off Strauss just pulls the bat inside the line;
1.4;?;Bollinger to Strauss, no run big swing from Bollinger! Strauss is drawn forward into an optimistic drive but massive, hooping movement away from him means he misses by a good few inches;
1.4;1w;Bollinger to Strauss, 1 wide short and wide outside off, you'd back Strauss to cash in on those every time but some extra bounce and movement away from him means the ball loops past the edge. Too far outside off, that's a wide;
1.3;1;Bollinger to Kieswetter, 1 run too straight, and the swing in to the right-hander takes it towards leg stump. Kieswetter nudges to midwicket and they set off immediately;
1.2;?;Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run tapped defensively back down the wicket off the back foot;
1.1;?;Bollinger to Kieswetter, no run good start, outside off and there's a touch of swing back in to Kieswetter, though it's wide enough to leave alone;
0.6;?;Tait to Strauss, no run full and swinging, but Strauss presents the full face of the bat to defend;
0.5;1;Tait to Kieswetter, 1 run back of a length this time, Kieswetter gets into some difficulty as he fends to leg, the ball pops up but falls safely;
0.4;?;Tait to Kieswetter, no run beaten again! Slightly fuller this time, but the swing is there again and the ball zips past the outside edge;
0.3;?;Tait to Kieswetter, no run absolute gem from Tait! Sharp swing away from the bat, late and at high pace. Kieswetter pushes at it, but that was too good to even get an edge on;
0.2;1lb;Tait to Strauss, 1 leg bye Strauss didn't quite pick this one up, but he takes it on the thigh pad and Kieswetter calls him through for a quick single;
0.2;1w;Tait to Strauss, 1 wide very quick again, but misdirected down the leg side this time and called wide;
0.1;?;Tait to Strauss, no run Tait starts with a loosener... that spits up savagely off a length outside off at more than 90mph. Strauss drops the hands and gets out of the way of that thunderbolt;

Hello folks, the players are back out in the middle and we're all set for what should be a cracking chase. I'm Liam Brickhill, and Sahil Dutta and I will be your commentators for the second innings.
