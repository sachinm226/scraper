And there is the declaration...so the Windies call it quits with a fine total on the board, it's taken a while but they have a very good total now with which to apply pressure in this mini session they will now have at the Australian top order.
Chanderpaul the star with another hundred but this total was far from all him, there were very important contributions throughout the order. And Brathwaite, Edwards and Bravo will be disappointed they didn't take their excellent starts on to bigger numbers. Still a good effort and the Test set up well now for the hosts, they'd certainly do well to lose from here...the Australian innings in five minutes time...

 Innings Start
2.03pm Australia have declared. No consideration given to Lyon's fifty or Harris's unbeaten tally. Well done Australia. I leave you with this statistic from Mazher Arshad as I catch a drink and come back to bring you the West Indies innings in a bit: "Ryan Harris, playing on 68, has surpassed Doug Ring's tally of 65 - in year 1951 at Sydney - the highest individual score by a Number 9 Australian batsman against West Indies in Test Cricket."
144.6;?;Edwards to Harris, no run wide of the crease, wide and full, hits the inside half of the bat as he drives;
144.5;?;Edwards to Harris, no run this one holds its line outside off, but matters little to Harris who drives it towards mid-off;
144.4;?;Edwards to Harris, no run full, just outside off, tailing in, driven back to Edwards;
144.3;?;Edwards to Harris, no run reversing towards off, Harris is solid and behind it, driving it to mid-on;
144.2;1lb;Edwards to Lyon, 1 leg bye reversing into the pads again, keeps it out;
144.1;1lb;Edwards to Harris, 1 leg bye late in swing for Sammy, appeal for lbw, pitched outside off, hits the back leg in front, given not out. That's okay, but there was hardly any appeal at all. This ball is shown to be clipping leg by technology;
143.6;?;Bishoo to Lyon, no run played with soft hands and guided into the gully;
143.5;?;Bishoo to Lyon, no run sat back now to push back to the bowler;
143.4;?;Bishoo to Lyon, no run forward and ran back to the bowler this time;
143.3;?;Bishoo to Lyon, no run defended in a similar manner;
143.2;?;Bishoo to Lyon, no run forward just outside off and blocked;
143.1;4;Bishoo to Lyon, FOUR runs short and pulled out to the midwicket rope, well picked up;
142.6;?;Edwards to Harris, no run length and strikes the pad;
142.5;?;Edwards to Harris, no run off stump and moved to midwicket;
142.4;1;Edwards to Lyon, 1 run width and sliced down to third man;
142.3;?;Edwards to Lyon, no run back of a length and moved to square leg;
142.3;5w;Edwards to Lyon, 5 wide but there's no saving this, a short ball way way down leg and it's called as five wides;
142.2;?;Edwards to Lyon, no run leg side, strikes the pad and well saved by Baugh tumbling to his left;
142.1;?;Edwards to Lyon, no run length ball that Lyon drives over as it keeps a bit low;
141.6;1;Bishoo to Lyon, 1 run stride forward and sweep out to deep square leg;
141.5;?;Bishoo to Lyon, no run staying in the crease now to play back to the bowler;
141.4;?;Bishoo to Lyon, no run slider and Lyon only just forward in time to keep it out;
141.3;?;Bishoo to Lyon, no run short and cut to mid off;
141.2;?;Bishoo to Lyon, no run forward now to block in front of silly point;
141.1;?;Bishoo to Lyon, no run back of a length and pushed into the covers;
140.6;2;Edwards to Harris, 2 runs little wider of off stump and driven out through the covers to bring two more;
140.5;?;Edwards to Harris, no run driven to mid off with a lunge forward, almost Shane Watson-like that stroke;
140.4;?;Edwards to Harris, no run forward and ran down to mid on;
140.3;?;Edwards to Harris, no run length outside off and blocked into the off side;
140.2;?;Edwards to Harris, no run leg side, flicked at and missed;
140.1;?;Edwards to Harris, no run catches Harris on the pad and given out! Harris goes upstairs... may as well...it might be a touch high perhaps, I don't think he's hit it, caught above the knee roll on the crease...it is high. Going over the top says Hawk Eye so Harris survives on review and the Aussie innings goes on;

50 runs really isn't much to Australia, they need time to try and bowl the Windies out...but I suppose nine down the innings might end quickly anyway...change in the bowling and Fidel Edwards, can he wrap things up...
 Innings Start
12.20pm Slight correction. We have 62 overs left because the innings has ended just before lunch, and we don't lose those two overs. Thanks, Andrew Schulz
12.13pm Clarke is at the boundary, waiting for his bowlers to arrive and receive the applause and pats on the backs. It's still a fascinating Test, not over by a long shot. So here's a repeat of the equation: 192 to get, 60 overs to get them in. Roach has given WI a fighting chance. Early wickets could push Australia back, and the asking rate could creep up, and there are no field restrictions if West Indies want to play for a draw. Early runs could free Australia up. Hoping for two final sessions that are just as gripping as the last couple of days have been. Join us around 12.45pm. Alex Winter will be waiting for you
66.4;W;Harris to Roach, OUT timber. Harris has broken through. Sixty overs, 192 runs. That's the equation. Sammy applauds Roach's fight. This is short of a length, outside off, and moves in. Roach pushes away from the body, gets an inside edge that hits the stumps;Kemar Roach b Harris 25 (82m 49b 1x4 0x6) SR: 51.02;
66.3;?;Harris to Roach, no run bouncer, on the stumps, Roach doesn't quite duck, but the half-bend is good enough to avoid it;
66.2;?;Harris to Roach, no run this is short of a length and holds its line outside off, and Roach is beaten;
66.1;?;Harris to Roach, no run full, just outside off, Roach digs it out. Drip by drip, West Indies move towards a fighting total;
65.6;?;Watson to Bishoo, no run seaming away from around leg again, Bishoo defends this outside off, to point;
65.5;?;Watson to Bishoo, no run full and wide, pushed off the back foot, keeps it down;
65.4;?;Watson to Bishoo, no run appeal for a catch at the wicket. This is a good delivery. Short of a length, pitched on leg, seaming away, squaring him up, but this has come off the back pad, and given not out;
65.3;1;Watson to Roach, 1 run appeal for a run-out. Roach pushes this to mid-off, wants a single, but Bishoo is ball-watching. Siddle goes for the keeper's end, Wade charges towards the stumps, fights the momentum to knock it back on the stumps, but Bishoo has made it by then;
65.2;?;Watson to Roach, no run and this ball is swinging too, pretty late too, but the inside edge saves WI an lbw;
65.1;1;Watson to Bishoo, 1 run flashes at a shortish ball outside off, but eludes gully - the lead is 190 now;
64.6;?;Harris to Roach, no run full, on off, pushed towards mid-off;
64.5;1;Harris to Bishoo, 1 run wide of the crease, length ball, on off, nicely pushed away through cover for one;
64.4;1;Harris to Roach, 1 run bangs this "new" ball in, outside off, and he fends it to third man;
64.3;?;Harris to Roach, no run short of a length, just outside off, defended solidly;
64.2;2;Harris to Roach, 2 runs this one holds its line outside off, driven nicely through cover, along the ground - the stand reaches 40 balls, Roach six short of his Test best;
64.1;?;Harris to Roach, no run length ball outside off, pushed to cover, Roach stays solid;
63.6;?;Watson to Bishoo, no run yorker from wide of the crease, but Bishoo digs it out. He has done well supporting Roach;
63.5;?;Watson to Bishoo, no run length ball, on off, pushed to cover;
63.4;1;Watson to Roach, 1 run short and wide, cut away to third man for another single;
63.3;1;Watson to Bishoo, 1 run lovely delivery, on a length, pitches middle and off, and then moves away against the angle, squaring him up, taking the edge for a single to third man;
63.2;?;Watson to Bishoo, no run goes wide of the crease, angling this in towards the stumps, pushed back to Watson;
63.1;?;Watson to Bishoo, no run length ball, on off, defended towards cover;
62.6;4;Lyon to Roach, FOUR runs full and wide, and he has squeezed this past the slip for four valuable runs - that's a lead of more than 180;
62.5;1;Lyon to Bishoo, 1 run short, flat, wide, cut away for one - aha this was his attempt at the one that turns the other way, a bit of a legcutter, but no impact this time;
62.4;?;Lyon to Bishoo, no run sharp turn and bounce, but it starts outside off, and Bishoo doesn't play at it;
62.3;?;Lyon to Bishoo, no run fuller and straighter, he pushes this towards mid-on;
62.2;?;Lyon to Bishoo, no run full, on off, Bishoo covers the spin well, and defends to silly point;
62.1;1;Lyon to Roach, 1 run turning into the pads, helped around the corner for a single;

Watson replaces Siddle. He goes round the stumps. No slips
 Innings Start
What a fabulous Test match. It was gritty, attritional stuff for three and a half days then sprung into life with wickets and this scramble of a run chase to get Australia home.
Remember where we were? West Indies with runs on the board and 150 ahead with only two wickets to take in the Australia first innings. But those last two wickets added 121 and turned the game. Michael Clarke declared behind and ran through West Indies who crumbled for 148.
192 was needed on this final afternoon, the only real question was whether the light would hold, remarkably it did until 5.45 and although Australia lost flurries of wickets, Shane Watson's 52 and Michael Hussey's 32 - who batted so magnificently under pressure - saw the tourists home.
West Indies must be absolutely gutted. They were in charge of the match but allowed it to slip out of their grasp and to be honest, played pretty ordinary cricket for the last day and a half. Collapsed under pressure with the bat in the second innings and in the run chase they were too negative, gave Australia easy runs and didn't create enough pressure. What might have been for them...
Presentation time... an exceptionally large man is part of the presentation party. Darren Sammy "We had our opportunities, we just didn't capitalise. It's one we though we had. We dominated for three days but one bad hour put us behind the eight ball."
Here's Michael Clarke..."I think you have to be positive. All credit has to go to our bowlers, not just with the ball but the way they batted in the first innings. We've got more than one allrounder in our team."
Man of the Match is Ryan Harris for a Test-best with the bat in the first innings and five wickets too.
It's been a fascinating game with a gripping finish but Australia have won by three wickets and go 1-0 up in this three-match series. Next up we're off to Trinidad for the second Test on Sunday so hope you can join us then.

46.6;1;Roach to Hilfenhaus, 1 run oh goodness, celebrations as they scramble a run but is there a run out at the non-strikers end?!? No! Australia have won! There was a fumble at mid off and mid on couldn't run Hilfenhaus out, it's he who's got the Aussies' home! What an ending to the game!;

44.6;1;Roach to Hussey, 1 run driven down the ground to long off;
44.5;W;Roach to Wade, OUT caught in the deep! More drama! Wade cuts out to deep cover and is caught off a top edge, simple catch to Bishoo in the deep, this will waste a couple more minutes perhaps;Matthew Wade c Bishoo b Roach 18 (35m 28b 0x4 0x6) SR: 64.28;
44.4;2;Roach to Wade, 2 runs back of a length and cracked into the off side, they hurtle back for two again, the running has been superb;
44.3;1;Roach to Hussey, 1 run driven down to long off;
44.2;1;Roach to Wade, 1 run full and driven out to cover, should only be one...and is, although they did consider coming back;
