Right, the players are out, under an overcast sky, and we're about to start. Kemar Roach will take the first new ball ...
9.55am: The covers are coming off! The start has been rescheduled for 10.15am, with a full 50-over schedule to come. Plenty of time for you to set up the steel drums.
9.45am: The St Vincent shower has been upgraded to a squall - a small but important escalation. The covers are still on, though we've not lost any overs yet. West Indies' battery of towering, bone-shuddering, Babylon fire-breathing quicks wobbly medium-pace allrounders will doubtless be licking their lips up in the dressing room ...
9.30am: So, the covers are on and the start has been delayed. It doesn't look too heavy but we'll keep you informed.
9.20am: The coin has been tossed - and Darren Sammy has won it (for the first time in 10 attempts, no less). He's decided West Indies will have a bowl, perhaps influenced by the conditions. I'm presuming he has not based his decision on the success of his team's chasing a target on Friday ...
Anyway, West Indies are also unchanged, with the match is due to get underway in 10 minutes' time. Although another shower has just swept in, it seems.
9.10am: I'm Alan Gardner, by the way, and I'll be joined on commentary by George Binoy. No news on the toss, as yet, but we have heard that Australia will be unchanged for this match. Whether any tweaks to the West Indies line-up can facilitate a change of outcome, remains to be seen.
Apparently there are a few sprinkles around Arnos Vale, though play is expected to start on time. Let's hope a quick spritz livens up the pitch, eh?
9.05am: Hello and welcome to live coverage of the second ODI between West Indies and Australia from St Vincent. After a collapse worthy of Jenga on Friday, West Indies are 1-0 down and still looking for their first 50-over win against the Aussies in six years. Can they end the drought today? Why not have a dig around in Brydon Coverdale's preview for answers ...
 Innings Start
6.05pm: That's a first ODI victory over the Aussies for West Indies since October 2006 and follows 13 defeats. Carlton Baugh looked tentative to begin with but he found the middle a few times as the night closed in, just as his side threatened to grind to a halt. That result squares the series at 1-1 but, psychologically, could be a lot more important. Kieron Pollard played a crucial hand, striking judicious blows at key moments - and he was still there at the end. This time, the bowlers' hard work wasn't thrown away.
Australia captain Shane Watson: "It was difficult definitely but in the end we were 20-30 runs short. Unfortunately we weren't able to get big enough partnerships through the start or middle ... In the end we kept on fighting but we were a little short. Once the sun got on the wicket it seemed to settle a little more but that's the great challeneg of the playing in the West Indies and we have to adapt a little better. It's about getting the balance of the batting - the wickets are a little different from home."
Sunil Narine is named Man of the Match: "The ball was spinning and I just had to concentrate on bowling correct areas. Today it came out well and I hope I can continue to do well for the captain for the rest of the series."
West Indies captain Darren Sammy: "It's a good feeling, the team played much better today, the bowlers did well again and there was much more responsibilty when chasing the runs. It was a total team effort ... All in all we were searchig for a win and we are glad we got over the line. From the last game, when we batted, there was not much change; today we did what we had to do and I'm just happy we won one."
So, we now have a contest, with episode three scheduled for Tuesday; do join us again then. Bye!

6.5;?;Lee to Charles, no run shorter ball, defended;
6.4;2;Lee to Charles, 2 runs another big swing, the ball goes up, up up and away ... but where to? Johnson's top-edge flew to third man, where Xavier Doherty took a catch diving over the rope, then threw the ball back into play before landing - it'll go down as a dropped catch but that was a fantastic piece of fielding!;
6.3;6;Lee to Charles, SIX runs a mighty swoosh of the arms and the white ball disappears over long-on and into the crowd! "Smoked him" as Tony Cozier aptly comments;
6.2;1;Lee to Samuels, 1 run back of a length, played from deep in the crease down to third man;
6.1;?;Lee to Samuels, no run length, nudged into the on side;

5.2;?;McKay to Charles, no run length, on off and straightening, defended with a straight bat;
5.1;?;McKay to Charles, no run on the stumps, solid defensive;
4.6;?;Lee to Samuels, no run edged ... but the ball dies on its way through to Wade. Better line from Lee but that was a profitable over for West Indies;
4.5;2;Lee to Samuels, 2 runs full, straight, tickled behind square leg again;
4.4;4;Lee to Samuels, FOUR runs full, leg-stump line and squeezed fine for four more - Lee's not really bowling to his field here;
4.3;1;Lee to Charles, 1 run angled towards leg again and Charles clips wristily, McKay's diving stop preventing another boundary;
4.2;4;Lee to Charles, FOUR runs strays down the leg side and neatly flicked to the boundary by the batsman;
4.1;?;Lee to Charles, no run yorker right on the stumps and Charles does well to slam his bat down on it;
3.6;?;McKay to Samuels, no run straighter, turned into the leg side and the batsmen change their minds about a run - maiden for McKay;
3.5;?;McKay to Samuels, no run pitched up and driven square but can't beat Dan Christian at cover-point;
3.4;?;McKay to Samuels, no run full length, Samuels steps outside off and leaves;
3.3;?;McKay to Samuels, no run width for Samuels, who smashes the ball towards point, where it's well fielded;
3.2;?;McKay to Samuels, no run full ball, nudged down the ground;
3.1;?;McKay to Samuels, no run on the stumps, defended;

2.2;1;Lee to Charles, 1 run fuller, room to drive outside off and steals a single wide of mid-off;
2.1;?;Lee to Charles, no run targeting the stumps, slightly short and worked towards midwicket;
1.6;?;McKay to Samuels, no run tight line and length from McKay, defended into the leg side;
1.5;?;McKay to Samuels, no run again defended on a length outside off, the bat scissoring down from point;
1.4;?;McKay to Samuels, no run good length, on the stumps and played down on to the wicket;
1.3;2;McKay to Samuels, 2 runs nagging length, nudged behind point for a couple;
1.2;?;McKay to Samuels, no run comes forward and pushes a defensive shot into the off side;
1.1;1;McKay to Charles, 1 run length, outside off and Charles tries to leave, the ball unintentionally thunking off the face of the bat and scooting down to third man;

0.2;?;Lee to Samuels, no run short, rearing outside off and thumping into a gloved hand;
0.1;W;Lee to Powell, OUT that's an abysmal leave! Lee's first ball is straight, on a good length and Powell shoulders arms! He's stuck in his crease, smack bang in front and that's the easiest decision Gregory Brathwaite has ever had to make, I imagine. What a start - West Indies aren't going to make this easy, are they?;Kieran Powell lbw b Lee 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

3.05pm: Howdy. Ready for the run crawl chase? Chris Gayle certainly is - the cameras have just picked him out in the crowd at Arnos Vale. He's wearing black, like any self-respecting cool cat.
Here's Edmund Gall, with a question: "Can you guys explain why WI has to make 158 runs to win - 4 more than the Aussies made in their 40 overs - despite having to face the same amount of overs as the Aussies? Thanks much!" It's because Australia had begun their innings before the overs were reduced, Edmund - D-L calculated that they would have made four more runs if they had known it was a 40-over match from the off; which seems to favour West Indies a touch.
West Indies run of defeats against Australia in ODIs stands at 13 - unlucky and then some. Can they reset the clock with a win here? We're about to find out, with Kieran Powell and Johnson Powell out in the middle. Brett Lee will open the bowling for Australia ...
