Watson and Warner back together at the top of the order. Hafeez will start with the new ball
Australia look a bit thin with their bowling, they have packed the batsmen in with White in down at No 8. Pakistan have as many as seven extremely acceptable bowling options
Chris: "I really hope Bailey is flexible with that batting line up. Why hide so much power down at 7 & 8? Would have White at 3 where he killed them in the IPL and in England, D. Huss and M. Huss at 4 and 5, then Maxwell. Wade then to finish off or Bailey himself if they need to stabilise."
7.30 pm Pakistan win the toss and will have a bowl
Nasir Jamshed and Glenn Maxwell are making their T20I debuts and Raza Hasan, the much talked about young left-arm spinner, is making his Pakistan debut
Hilfenhaus and Cummins the fast bowlers for Australia. Umar Gul is back after being left out of the squad for the ODI series. Also returning is Imran Nazir
Shahid Afridi does not seem to have recovered from the blow he took to his left wrist while bowling in the final ODI
Bailey: "I am pretty happy to lose that one. We would have probably ended up bowling first as well."
7.20 pm Have a look at Dan Brettig's preview for the game while we wait for the toss.
Lots of changes in the squads of both teams from the ODI series, which was won 2-1 by Australia. New captains in George Bailey and Mohammad Hafeez to start with. Veterans Abdul Razzaq and Brad Hogg return, as do fast bowlers Umar Gul, Mohammad Sami, Pat Cummins and Ben Hilfenhaus
7.15 pm local time It is T20 time. The World Twenty20 is less than two weeks away, and the toss for the first T20 international between Pakistan and Australia in Dubai is less than 15 minutes away
Robin Jackman doing the pitch report on air says there is an even covering of grass on the hard surface, which he feels will help the fast bowlers a bit. There is some breeze around as well, and Jackman says that should help keep the dew under control, making it easier for spinners to grip the ball
 Innings Start
That is it from us for this game. The second T20I is on Friday at 8 pm local time. Join us then. Abhishek Purohit signing off. Cheers
Bailey: "Completely outplayed. The pitch was a little bit slow, but the top order need to bat for longer and score more runs, that is the name of the game in T20. We are working towards the World T20, and this is the first step towards that."
Mohammad Hafeez is the Man of the Match. Hafeez: "Great team effort. Bowlers stuck to their plans, Raza Hasan showed a lot of character for a debutant."
Ten Cricket inform us that this is Australia's heaviest T20I defeat ever, in terms of balls remaining. They had hardly anything to defend really, after their second-worst batting performance in T20Is. Can't even put it down to the new arrivals being rusty in alien conditions. Six of the top eight played in the ODI series. Top performance from Pakistan though. They were intense in the field and with the ball right through the 20 overs.
