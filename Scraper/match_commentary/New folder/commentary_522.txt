Data
So then, South Africa have piled up 6 for 288. A fantastic effort. There were two handy innings from Amla and de Villiers, and then this gem from Duminy, who has extended his love affair with Australia into the last game of this tour. South Africa chose to bat and they will be pleased with this effort. Australia's bowlers struggled at the death, served up some full tosses and wide deliveries, and Duminy and Botha cashed in. South Africa scored 92 in the last ten overs.
Australia need to chase 289 to keep their No. 1 position in ODI cricket. We will be back for their reply in a bit.

Hello and a very warm welcome to you wherever you are to Cricinfo's coverage of the fifth and final one-day international from Perth. The series has been sealed by South Africa and Australia, wounded a second time around after the Test series loss, need to hit some form before they host New Zealand for the five-game Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. What can we expect from this match?
Well, for starters, the top ranking is up for grabs in this "dead rubber". Should Australia lose again tonight, and go 4-1 down in the series, they will fall from the top of the ICC's ODIs rankings.
On the personnel front, South Africa will play two debutants after deciding to rest Dale Steyn and Makhaya Ntini - and they are Wayne Parnell, 19, and Lonwabo Tsotsobe, 24. Jacques Kallis has been rested.
Michael Clarke has been ushered back into Australia's squad ahead of schedule to try to strengthen a team badly short of experience and confidence. Australia will hope Clarke's presence gives them a batter showing here going into the first of five ODIs against New Zealand on Sunday. Nathan Bracken also returns from injury, with Cameron White and Shaun Tait the men to make way.
The WACA is another venue where South Africa have had the better of Australia, winning two of the three ODIs between the teams. Australia's recent record in Perth is not so bad though; only once in the past decade have they been beaten in a WACA ODI. All this makes for interesting stats, but let us see what happens out in the middle.
I'm Jamie Alter, your commentator for the game, and on scoring duty is Venkat Raghav.
Play will be under way in about 30 minutes, so don't go anywhere and if you'd like, we have some wallpapers of Australian and South African players for you to download.
Let's cut to the chase and get straight to the news that is coming to us from Perth. South Africa have won the toss and chosen to bat.
Just to remind you, the teams are:
Australia: 1 Shaun Marsh, 2 David Warner, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Michael Hussey, 6 David Hussey, 7 Brad Haddin (wk), 8 James Hopes, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Nathan Bracken, 11 Ben Hilfenhaus.
South Africa: 1 Herschelle Gibbs, 2 Hashim Amla, 3 AB de Villiers (wk), 4 JP Duminy, 5 Neil McKenzie, 6 Vaughn van Jaarsveld, 7 Albie Morkel, 8 Morne Morkel, 9 Johan Botha (capt), 10 Wayne Parnell, 11 Lonwabo Tsotsobe.
We can tell you that the WACA pitch has lost some of the famed zip it had. You need not look further than day five of the Test here in December. South Africa needed 187 to win. Australia only managed one wicket. An epic Test was sealed. Remember that game? Yup, I thought so.
It is 33?C in Perth as we speak, and it looks a gorgeous day. Over to live action. It's Bracken to open the bowling. One slip. Hashim Amla on strike.
 Innings Start
The South Africans clamber on to the field and celebrate. They have rounded off an epic tour with victory in the final ODI. Australia have been displaced from the top spot. South Africa batted well to post 288 and then reduced Australia to 4 for 53, from which they never really recovered. Hussey and Haddin tried to keep them in the hunt with half-centuries, but the home side always faced a massive salvage operation.
Lonwabo Tsotsobe snapped up his ODI wicket in his first over and came back to finish with four on debut. Botha was, as he has been all series, hard to score off because he fired them in quick and flat.
Lets go over to the post-match conference. The Man of the Match is Hashim Amla for his 97. He jogs up to the podium and chats to Mark Taylor. He is disappointed to miss a century but enjoyed the chance to contribute to victory. The Man of the Series is Albie Morkel for his 105 runs at 52.50, three wickets and two catches. His thigh and hip are a bit sore, he says, but like Amla he's just glad to have been a part of this winning unit.
Ricky Ponting says a few words: "Its been a disappointing way to round off this series. We were competitive in the first two games but were under par in the last two games. We've made a lot of mistakes but I can't put the finger on one reason we lost. Its been a learning curve for a lot of our newer guys. We have to give South Africa all the credit. They have had the better of us on most occasions."
Off he goes and up comes Botha: "The guys placed nicely and everyone contributed. The young players came in and were counted. Things went my way and I'm happy about how it all went. I don't know what will happen next, but Smith will come back."
The South Africans get together for a photo-op with the series silverware. Hats off to them, what a great tour they have had. Series wins in the Tests and ODIs. A great moment for them.
That is the end of the series from all of us at Cricinfo, but we will be back to bring you Australia's next match, the first of five ODIs against New Zealand, starting on this very ground on Sunday, February 1 at 13:30 local time (04:30 GMT). Hope you all have had fun and thanks for following Cricinfo again.
