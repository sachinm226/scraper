That ends a very satisfying bowling performance by Sri Lanka and let's mention the fielding as well. They made up for their lapses from the second final. There was the odd misfield/drop, but their energy in the field helped them come back after Warner blazed away as usual.
There was some debate whether SL gambled by not taking the extra spinner, but Maharoof responded well and justified his inclusion. It could have been a lot worse for Australia, if not for their lower order.
Still, such is the nature of these teams that even 231 might turn out to be competitive. Don't count Australia out yet. They will come out charging. Whatever it is, we should expect another absorbing chase. Join us in 30 minutes.
I said earlier we should not mention India today, but I'll make just one exception. Here's Sheshachala: "Perfect timing, just like his perfect shots. He didn't want Indian team in Australia to be distracted in the middle of tour because of retirement news etc. So, he chose to announce only after the team's return to India."

Toss: Sri Lanka have won the toss and they have opted to bowl first. They are not playing a second spinner, so Dilshan should bowl his quota. Watson says he would have batted anyway. He will continue to bat at No.3. Forrest returns.
Kapugedera keeps his spot and so does Maharoof. There was an injury cloud with Maharoof but Mathews isn't fit. The teams will be updated above.
Jayawardene said his team is confident of chasing anything down, so why not? The self belief of this team has really grown, at least since the 4th one-dayer in South Africa. Till that point, they looked a bit lost. They regrouped once the pressure of the series was off, and have gotten better since they landed in Australia. They weren't at their peak at the start of the CB Series, but picked up.
@JesseHogan: "After scanning scorecards I reckon this 1st time in 162 ODIs, and 6 yrs, that Aus has chosen 2 spinners, since 2006." Cullen and Hogg were the men at that time.
Prasanna: "Australia missed a trick here by picking two spinners against a subcontinent team, spin variation matters more than spin options and guess what David Hussey is always there with his part time spin as a second option."
1.15pm: Just heard that Nathan Lyon will be making his one-day debut today. Ian Chappell feels that this pitch will be slower, so both teams will have to back their spinners. Win the toss and bat, says Ian.
It's sunny at the Adelaide Oval. Just what we needed for the third and final 'final' of this CB Series. It's been such a long home season, it's no wonder there are so many injuries. Clarke's not around today for sure, so Shane Watson will take over again.
The toss is about 15 minutes away. Australia had scrapped the concept of the annual tri-series a few years ago and instead opted for the bilateral series for the touring teams. However, this gives Cricket Australia a rather pleasant headache. Reason being that this has been a very competitive tri-series, between three fairly imperfect sides. Unpredictability has added to the allure, so it remains to be seen if CA want to rework their fixtures plan for forthcoming seasons.
While we wait, you may read the preview of this game. I'd also recommend Sidharth Monga's diary of Ian and Greg Chappell's backyard duels.
 Innings Start
Presentation time:
McKay, is the Man of the Match: "The batting was important to the situation in this game. It's great to be back in this squad. I had to keep the six by Dhoni (at Adelaide) out of my head."
The Man of the Series is Dilshan: "We played very well throughout but today we didn't finish well. We've played great cricket after SA. I took the wrong option against Lee, but they bowled and fielded well. I'm enjoying my one-day cricket. Thanks for all the support and the fans who've come from Melbourne."
Jayawardene: "Initially if we were given 231 we would have taken it. They put a lot of pressure on us, one of those days. Very proud of the boys against two quality teams. The objective is to rebuild for the next four years and we've learnt a lot and I'm proud of the youngsters."
Clarke: "Much better team without me I reckon. All the boys have a few more grey hairs. Hopefully I will get to Windies at the back-end of the one-dayers. Watson's done another good job. I think we continue to see the strength of our domestic set up, getting guys ready for Australia."
Australia pose with the trophy. That ends the Australia home season. Will they revert to the tri-series concept? Nobody knows.
So Australia go to Windies, Sri Lanka go to Bangladesh. And the rest of us go home. Thanks for joining us today. Sri Lanka, don't despair. You did great getting to the finals despite all the off-field tension about payments. Continue the good work. Cheers!
End of match: That concludes one of the most open tri-series in Australia in recent times. Sri Lanka probably never expected to hold the edge over Australia coming into the first final, but they made Australia sweat. In the end, the visitors were made to work hard and also pay for those soft dismissals at the top.
McKay's showing has added to the depth to Australia's bowling attack, with Pattinson and Cummins around. In the final analysis, it brings to an end a very rewarding home season after the Ashes drubbing last year.
There will be an extended presentation today, given it's the final. It's these middling totals that make ODI cricket more watchable. Sri Lanka's resurgence has also made this tournament more watchable, and of course Kohli's blinder, which gave the final league game some context.
Some comments:
Squirrelson: "Clint McKay is much much better than Hilfenhaus and Harris. They are one dimentional and one trick ponies. Poor McKay is always the one getiing dropped after losses even if it's not his fault. How id he suppose to get into rhythm if he keeps on getting dropped? He should be picked in the Test XI as well. When things are not going Australia's way, he's got a bag full of tricks and a great team man. Slower balls are under-estimated and under-used in test
Saradhi: "It shall be long time before I forget this series, thank you SL for fond memories."
