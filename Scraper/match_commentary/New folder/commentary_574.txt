Sri Lanka's batsmen did well to come back from 4 earlyish wickets to post 221, with good fifties from Jayawardene and Dilshan.

7.3;?;Bracken to Jayasuriya, no run Bracken pushes outside off and the batsman is tempted, dangerously so, into coming out and playing at it, the ball leaps on naughtily, giggling to itself;
7.2;1;Bracken to Sangakkara, 1 run responds well with a tight one up on middle, pushed out and they scramble through as Bracken does his best soccer player impression, nearly dribbling on to the posts at the striker's end, but just wide. Goal kick;
7.1;1;Bracken to Jayasuriya, 1 run outside off, more than enough width for Jayasuriya to lash a back-foot late cut up and over third man;

3.5;?;Bracken to Jayasuriya, no run again Bracken gives nothing away, defended on the front foot tightly, not much else could be done there;
3.4;?;Bracken to Jayasuriya, no run pushes this one flat down the channel, good carry through to the keeper and the batsman leaves it serenely;

2.5;?;Lee to Perera, no run more of the same, the batsman wise enough to leave on both occasions;
2.4;?;Lee to Perera, no run pushed outside off on a good length with some vicious wobble (if that's not an oxymoron, wobbles always seem so harmless);
2.3;1;Lee to Jayasuriya, 1 run now, you shouldn't laugh but everyone else is, even Perera as he runs through for Jayasuriya's push-and-run, Lee runs out to get the ball and Perera trips over him, loses his bat, tries to grope his way forward and just about gets his hand back in by the time Symonds throws the stumps down;
2.2;?;Lee to Jayasuriya, no run fired hard across him, and he gets in a tangle as he tries to force the ball off the back foot to cover, it clatters down on him and he looks for the single;

1.1;1;Bracken to Perera, 1 run in he runs, his self-proclaimed designer hair bobbing in the breeze, and the batsman plays out and they have to hurry through;
0.6;4;Lee to Jayasuriya, FOUR runs outside off and Jayasuriya scintillates as he lifts the ball from a good length up and over extra cover, the ball goes soaring and lands just inside the rope, two bounces and it's four;
0.5;?;Lee to Jayasuriya, no run stays over the wicket to the left hander and nearly has him chopping on as Jayasuriya cuts off the back foot back and the inside edge crashes past the leg stump;
0.4;1;Lee to Perera, 1 run some encouraging swing as the ball goes down the off-side, and is helped on its way with a push off the back foot to third man;
0.3;?;Lee to Perera, no run ripper delivery - literally, it ripped straight past the outside edge as the batsman plays forward on the front foot down the channel... and misses;
0.2;1;Lee to Jayasuriya, 1 run pitched up on off and tucked out for a single;
0.1;3;Lee to Perera, 3 runs starts a fraction too straight, clipped off the legs easily and they run three well;

2.15pm Brilliant to see, Australia have just formed a guard of honour to allow Sanath Jayasuriya to walk through and on to the pitch and what must be his last match in Australia. And well deserved, Jayasuriya is a champion. Let's hope he's got some final fireworks in him today. He'll be at the non-striker's end as Dilruwan Perera readies to face Brett Lee. They're starting at the Members End, with Daryl Harper standing there and two slips in
2.10pm Just while we're waiting for this match to begin, confirmation has come through that Jason Gillespie - as widely expected - has announced his retirement. He's been such a good player for Australia and South Australia and has been in great form for his state this season. He told me a few months ago that he was still up for playing for Australia. If you check out our homepage there will be tributes to him and a gallery, hopefully soon.
2.05pm Jayawardene says: "This wicket looks very dry, runs on the ball will be very vital. The last time we had here it had a bit of moisture so bowled first, but this is very dry and we've had good weather here a few days.
"The whole tournament we've played with that problem where we lose too many wickets. It's something we will have to work on when we get back home. We haven't been consistent enough (for six months) so we just need to work really hard and come back strong. The guys are very disappointed with the whole tournament, but we've tried our best."
Ponting says: "They have been slow throughout the summer. It's not a bad toss for us to lose. I was having a think about bowling first anyway, give the bowlers a chance to swing the ball around." He points out that Australia haven't bowled first much in this tournament.
He confirms why Hayden is out. "Just rest. He's had a couple of long days and long nights." Note too that Johnson has been swapped in for Stuart Clark.
Mark Taylor's just taken a very hard line on Hayden on Nine: "It's unusual for Matthew Hayden to rest as this time of the season. I hope that he's just resting. I can't help but think he's been distracted by Harbhajan Singh. The other night I think he got away lightly. Matthew Hayden broke his own laws and the spirit of cricket. I think he should accept the rap on the knuckles and get on with it." Right, that's really the last word on it.
2.00pm Here are the teams: Australia 1 Adam Gilchrist (wk), 2 James Hopes, 3 Ricky Ponting (capt), 4 Michael Clarke, 5 Michael Hussey, 6 Andrew Symonds, 7 Brad Haddin, 8 Brad Hogg, 9 Brett Lee, 10 Mitchell Johnson, 11 Nathan Bracken.
No Hayden then, he'll be resting, so Haddin comes in.
Sri Lanka look like this: 1 Sanath Jayasuriya, 2 Dilruwan Perera, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene (capt), 5 Chamara Kapugedera, 6 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 7 Chamara Silva, 8 Nuwan Kulasekera, 9 Lasith Malinga, 10 Muttiah Muralitharan, 11 Ishara Amerasinghe.
Vaas is out, Kulasekera is in.
1.45pm Toss news - Mahela Jayawardene has won and Sri Lanka will bat.
1.30pm An early greetings, hello and welcome along to Australia's match with Sri Lanka. It's only the 12th match of this series, it perhaps feels a bit longer, and we could be churlish by pointing out it's a dead rubber.
Australia aren't seeing it like that at all, they are going to treat this game at the MCG as a final and get in some much-needed practice. Yes they finally fired against India t'other day but one batting swallow does not a runs-filled summer make. So they will appreciate the practice. As will Sri Lanka, if truth be told: they've won only one match this tournament and they will appreciate another run-out to test their batting.
Plus of course it's nice to have some cricket quickly back on the agenda after Matthew Hayden's unkind remarks about Harbhajan Singh on Tuesday. There'll be no love lost when the first final gets underway on Sunday.
But for now we'll concentrate on Sri Lanka's pride-salvaging efforts and Australia's practice which will be described by me Jenny Thompson. And now Brydon Coverdale dons his jersey and gives us the weather report. "It's cool and cloudy, but a little sun, might be rain later but nothing yet. And there's hardly anyone in so far." Jersey, a funny word when you think about it, and more bizarre to me is calling a vest a guernsey or bedding manchester but I know where you're coming from, nice Australian people. So carry on.
Teams and toss news when I have it.
 Innings Start
Jayasuriya loves that, clenching his fist and if that's his last contribution in a game on Australian soil, as it is likely to be, well, that was a fitting ending. What a game at the MCG, it had everything and Sri Lanka are jubilant with their second win of the tournament. It's not enough for them to stay in the tournament of course, but this was the most live of dead rubbers. Handshakes all round now as the Australia team come into the tunnel.
10.20pm Here's Jayasuriya. "We badly needed this win today. Overall we didn't bat well. The bowlers have been bowling well and the fielders have backed up well."
And here's another who won't be back to Australia, Murali. "It's going to be the last tour for me definitely, good on us for finishing like that. I enjoyed myself always, sometimes ups and downs in Australia but I enjoy the cricket."
And their departure will be swift, as Jayasuriya explains. "We are flying out tonight, a 12.30 flight. Should be able to do it, a wash and then on to the airport."
Great work from the pair who have given so much to the game over so many years.
Here's Ponting. "It looked like a couple of us got done off the surface rather than anything else. These sort of wickets, and chasing runs, you can't affort to lose groups of wickets. Gilly struck the ball beautifully. He's showing some great form going into the finals. I'd rather that performance come tonight rather than on Sunday.
"It's always painful when you lose, especially when you seemingly have the game in the bag like we did. Sri Lanka bowled well and took the chances when they came."
Tonight's Man of the Match is Gilchrist, although Jayawardene must have come close there. "I had that game by the throat, so I feel a bit silly," he says. "I should have seen it through, I got carried away. When you get out like that you think 'No big deal' but then it changed.
"I'm very proud of the time I've had here. The crowd were fantastic, just a shame they've got to leave with a loss. Hopefully this will sharpen us up, it was a reminder."
Here's Jayawardene now: "Guys are all ready to head to the airport. We showed a lot of character today and can take a lot of positives. We had a lot of opportunities in this tournament but we didn't take them. We have to learn to take them."
Thanks for joining me for this cracker today. Do tune in again on Sunday when we'll be back with coverage of the sold-out first final from the SCG when Australia will take on India while Sri Lanka are leaving on a jet plane... in a few hours. They'll be able to have a celebratory drink then, though after today.
