5.06pm What a finish from India. They have done superbly to restrict Australia under 300, they conceded just 59 runs off the last 10 overs after Aaron Finch's sensational hundred and another Steven Smith fifty put them in command of the game. All the bowlers contributed nicely, taking wickets and bowling good defensive lines. Australia's batting came to the fore in the first half of the innings, but then failed miserably in the second half. They have the runs on the board, but is it enough? This total is just 12 runs more than what India managed in Chennai after falling to 11 for 3, that surface was much tougher than this one. So India well in front at the halfway mark. Deiva M will be back after the break.
Aaron Finch, the century-maker: "Nice to get a hundred, but we left a few out there. Did a rigorous fitness test yesterday. They bowled extremely well with the new ball, their plan was to get us playing across the line, which was high risk. Not an easy pitch to score on right away."

49.2;1;Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run good length outside off, carved away to the sweeper cover for one more. Superb stuff this;
49.2;1w;Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 wide gets inside the line this time, trying to help it down to fine leg but it drifts down leg for a wide.;
49.2;1w;Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 wide the wide slower delivery that is too wide. Called a wide;
49.1;?;Bumrah to Stoinis, no run Stoinis backs away and Bumrah follows him, good length on leg, defended back. Can't do much more. Sensational bowling;
48.6;?;Bhuvneshwar to Agar, no run a good wide delivery outside off, inside the tramline.;
48.5;1;Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run smashed away, but the field is well set and Bhuvneshwar is bowling to his field. Full and wide, hammered to deep cover for one.;
48.4;1;Bhuvneshwar to Agar, 1 run 120 kph, a wide slower ball outside off, Agar chips a drive to the sweeper cover. Falls well in front;
48.3;1;Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run extremely full outside off, Stoinis is sitting back in the crease but still can't get enough on his drive. To long-off for one;
48.2;1;Bhuvneshwar to Agar, 1 run full and straight, that's Agar's job, bat on ball to long-on for one;
48.1;1;Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run full and wide outside off, sliced to deep point. Excellent defensive bowling;
45.6;?;Bumrah to Handscomb, no run 137 kph, full around off, driven to mid-off where Pandey is quick on the ball. Stoinis is sent back in time;
45.6;1w;Bumrah to Handscomb, 1 wide strays down leg for a wide;
45.5;1;Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run on a length around off, inside-edged towards midwicket for one. A tight, but easy run;
45.4;1;Bumrah to Handscomb, 1 run shuffles right across and flicks down to fine leg for one;
45.3;W;Bumrah to Head, OUT goes straight through , 119 kph, it's a slower ball on middle and leg, the offcutter. Head plays with an angled bat, trying to find midwicket, but that means the ball has enough room to go through his flick and hit the stumps. Middle stump is uprooted. Australia losing their way;Travis Head b Bumrah 4 (18m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
45.2;1lb;Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 leg bye skiddy, 132 kph, full around leg, beats Stoinis' inside edge and hits him on the back leg;
45.1;?;Bumrah to Stoinis, no run good length on off, Stoinis can only keep it out. Fine bowling this;

44.2;1;Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run shuffled right across, full on off, hit away to midwicket via the pad. It's pad and then bat. Kohli wants to review, not a bad time to do so. Definitely pad first, but impact is just outside the line. So good call from the umpire Shamshuddin;
44.1;?;Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, no run a full drifty delivery outside off, may have been the knuckle ball, 124 kph, cut to point;
47.6;1;Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run on the pads, and off it for a run to fine leg. Just four off the over;
47.5;W;Bumrah to Handscomb, OUT sensational catching from Pandey. A slower delivery outside off is hit nicely to long-off, it looks like six for the entirety of its trajectory until Pandey gets around to his right, takes a reverse-cupped catch, realises he was stepping over the boundary and threw it back up in the air. Then, he nonchalantly got back in and took the catch, no fuss, no trouble.;Peter Handscomb c Pandey b Bumrah 3 (13m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 42.85;
47.4;1;Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run fuller than good length around off, punched down to long-off. Another single more;

47.2;1;Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run good length outside off, pushed to the sweeper cover. Stoinis thinks of two, but Rahane is quick on it. Great bowling, the lengths are so intentionally all over the place that the batsmen can't line 'em up;
47.1;?;Bumrah to Stoinis, no run a slower ball outside off, Stoinis can't get bat on ball. It's another cutter. Stoinis' strike rate now dips below 100;
46.6;?;Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, no run another big hoick that Handscomb misses. Full outside off, no bat.;
46.5;?;Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, no run a full slow delivery outside off, Handscomb stays in his crease, trying to go over long-on but no connection;
46.4;1;Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run a low full toss outside off is smashed to the deep cover for one;
46.3;4;Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, FOUR runs what power from Stoinis. Bhuvneshwar goes straight this time, full around off, drilled past Bhuvi's feet. Long-off didn't have a long way to go but did not have a chance;
46.3;1w;Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 wide another short wide delivery that is too wide for legality;
46.2;1;Bhuvneshwar to Handscomb, 1 run well out with a direct hit. A good length delivery is patted to Chahal at cover. Stoinis set off late, Handscomb called for one as soon as he hit it. Chahal misses at the batsman's end;
46.1;1;Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 run full and wide, sliced to deep point. Keeping the ball out of the hitting arc;
46.1;1w;Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 wide full and too wide outside off, called. A few too many extras here;
43.6;1;Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run the googly on off, worked to square leg for one;
43.5;1;Kuldeep to Head, 1 run 75 kph, lots of flight outside off, punched to long-off;
43.4;?;Kuldeep to Head, no run the googly outside off, Head goes back and punches to point;
43.3;1;Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 run slow outside off, pushed in front of cover for a run.;
43.2;6;Kuldeep to Stoinis, SIX runs enough muscle behind that to clear long-off. A googly outside off, Stoinis got underneath it and swung cleanly over long-off. He may have read that well;
43.1;1;Kuldeep to Head, 1 run lots of flight outside off, well outside his hitting arc, driven to long-off for one;
42.6;?;Chahal to Stoinis, no run short and wide outside off, left alone from Stoinis, wanted a wide. Umpire doesn't think so;
42.5;?;Chahal to Stoinis, no run quick and straight, flat, pushed back;
42.4;1;Chahal to Head, 1 run flat outside off, driven to mid-off for a run. The fielder hits the stumps at the bowler's end;

42.2;?;Chahal to Stoinis, no run quick on the pads, nudged to midwicket. Vital dot balls at this time of the innings;
42.1;W;Chahal to Maxwell, OUT Maxwell gone now. Two in two for India. Australia losing their way. He shuffled right across, looking to go straight. He came running down but Chahal fires this wide outside off, so wide that Maxwell can't even get close to it. Misses it by a distance and Dhoni's hands are far too quick for Maxwell to consider going back. Chahal has him thrice in this series now, all while Maxwell has tried to take him down. Fantastic defensive bowling from India's spinners;Glenn Maxwell st ?Dhoni b Chahal 5 (18m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 38.46;
41.6;W;Kuldeep to Smith, OUT easily taken at long-off. It's the googly outside off, Smith wanted to get closer to the ball and hit it straighter but the ball skews off the outside half and lobs to Bumrah at long-off. Looking into the sun is Bumrah, but he has his sunglasses on. Kuldeep has been a touch expensive, but has got two big wickets when they're trying to go after him.;Steven Smith c Bumrah b Kuldeep Yadav 63 (111m 71b 5x4 0x6) SR: 88.73;
41.5;1;Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run flat and short outside off, muscled to long-on. Not getting the elevation he wants;
41.5;1w;Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 wide the seam-up delivery, took everyone by surprise but it's down leg. 90 kmph.;
41.5;1w;Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 wide the slow googly outside off is too wide and is called;
41.4;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run shortish and wide, hit to the sweeper cover from the back foot;
41.3;2;Kuldeep to Smith, 2 runs a googly outside off, sees Smith coming and bowls it wide. Smith can still cut through point for a couple. Excellent cricket;
41.2;1;Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run the googly, bowled it wide outside off, powered to long-on. Don't think he read that;
41.1;?;Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run flat and wide outside off, that line is very intentional, slapped to cover;
40.6;?;Chahal to Smith, no run terrific over, just two from it. Flight outside off, driven away to cover. Losing some momentum;

40.4;?;Chahal to Smith, no run quick and flat, nudged to midwicket;
40.3;1;Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run a slow delivery outside off, plenty of flight, slapped to long-off. Didn't make the mistake of trying to go over long-on like Chennai;
40.2;1;Chahal to Smith, 1 run shortish outside off, spins away and Smith's intended pull to midwicket goes to square leg instead;
40.1;?;Chahal to Smith, no run quick outside off, turning away, 87 kph, pushed back;
39.6;?;Bumrah to Maxwell, no run a low full toss on middle is worked away to midwicket. Good from Bumrah;

39.1;?;Bumrah to Maxwell, no run full and wide outside off to start from Bumrah, guided to backward point;

38.5;1;Hardik to Maxwell, 1 run good length outside off, punched to the sweeper cover;
38.4;?;Hardik to Maxwell, no run 132 kph, short and straight, it's not short enough, doesn't get up much either. Maxwell wants to ramp it over third man, but is hit on the glove. Awkwardly played;
38.3;1;Hardik to Smith, 1 run fullish delivery outside off, driven to the sweeper cover;
38.2;2;Hardik to Smith, 2 runs on the pads, flicked away to deep backward square leg for a comfortable brace;

37.6;?;Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run the googly down leg, worked away to midwicket;
37.5;W;Kuldeep to Finch, OUT taken at deep midwicket. Finch's belligerence ends. It's full and Finch sees an opportunity to hit it over midwicket, but Finch can't get underneath the length, which means his heave goes straight and flat to Jadhav at deep midwicket, who takes it awkwardly. A white towel falls off, and Finch thinks it's the ball. But has to walk off. Fine innings from Finch, has put Australia in command;Aaron Finch c Jadhav b Kuldeep Yadav 124 (154m 125b 12x4 5x6) SR: 99.2;
37.4;2;Kuldeep to Finch, 2 runs short on off, Finch stays back and pummels a pull wide of long-on. Rahane gets across and stops the boundary;

36.1;?;Hardik to Smith, no run good length around off, Smith misses a run after failing to connect with a flick;
35.6;6;Kuldeep to Finch, SIX runs a mis-timed six. Wanted to go over long-on or midwicket but the ball turns, takes the outside half and travels straight over the bowler for six. Just clears the boundary too;
35.5;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run drifting down leg, a tickle on that from Smith to fine leg;
35.4;?;Kuldeep to Smith, no run ooh, short and straight, Smith goes back and punches to cover. Won't be happy with that result;

34.5;1w;Hardik to Finch, 1 wide drifts down leg, wide called;
34.4;4;Hardik to Finch, FOUR runs smashed! Shortish on middle, sits up for Finch and he gives it a good thwack through midwicket. Disdain, out of my face Hardik.;
34.3;?;Hardik to Finch, no run good length around off, clipped to midwicket;
34.2;2;Hardik to Finch, 2 runs good length on middle and leg, nudged behind square for a couple. Sensational batting from Finch. India under pressure. 200 up;

33.1;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run flat on the pads, flicked down to fine leg again for one;
32.6;?;Hardik to Finch, no run good stop from Pandya. A three-run over, India will take that. A slower ball outside off, driven back where Pandya dives to his right and saves a run;
32.5;2;Hardik to Finch, 2 runs good length outside off, sliced behind point for a couple. The backward point fielder should have done better, just escorted it to the deep fielder. No dive;
32.4;?;Hardik to Finch, no run good length around off, flicked to midwicket from the crease;
32.3;?;Hardik to Finch, no run good length, around off, pushed back to the bowler. Using the variations nicely here is Pandya.;
32.2;?;Hardik to Finch, no run a slower cutter outside off, the ball goes underneath Finch's lazy drive. Fatigue maybe?;
32.1;1;Hardik to Smith, 1 run full around off, defended to cover, where Kohli picks up and throws at the bowler's end, the back-up can't get there in time and concedes the overthrow. Unnecessary;

31.5;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run overpitched outside off, driven to long-off;
31.4;?;Kuldeep to Smith, no run flat down leg, Smith looks for a hard sweep again but misses. Dhoni does well to stop byes;

30.2;?;Chahal to Smith, no run flat outside off, defended into the cover;
30.1;4;Chahal to Smith, FOUR runs just beautiful batting. Negating wristspin with so much ease. Runs at the bowler, meets the ball as it pitches and flicks the ball - against the spin - over midwicket. How easy did he make a tough shot look?;
29.6;4;Kuldeep to Finch, FOUR runs flat and wide outside off and boooom! Straight past Smith. Down the ground. Long-off has no chance. Sublime hitting. His muscle has got him 10 runs in two balls;
29.5;6;Kuldeep to Finch, SIX runs just clears long-off. Would have been gobbled up at the Gabba, but not here. The googly outside off, Finch picks the variation, tries to go over cover but gets it straighter. Bumrah at long-off just watches it go over him;

28.4;?;Chahal to Finch, no run quick and straight, skewed to midwicket. Still nothing full;
28.3;?;Chahal to Finch, no run short and wide, not bowling full intentionally. Slapped to Kohli at cover, who dives to his left, much to the crowd's delight;

26.4;6;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, SIX runs the slower ball again and far too full, Finch picks the variation, gets underneath the length and extends his drive, that's all really. Fantastic timing, short boundaries, six anyday;
26.3;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run goes wide of the crease, comes back in, Finch sees width but it isn't really wide enough to cut. Beaten on his cut;
26.2;?;Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run nicely bowled, a slower ball outside off, blocked to cover. The knuckle ball actually;
26.1;1;Bhuvneshwar to Smith, 1 run full outside off, Smith opens his bat face and guides it to the sweeper cover. Just looking for some control here are India;

Over the wicket to the right hander
 Innings Start
9.18pm Not many ODI chases have been as clinical and as convincing as that this year. Chasing 294, India got a fine start via fifties from Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma, and that was it really. Australia just did not have the depth or personnel to challenge India's strong batting thereon. India did stutter, but they now have nine wins on the bounce, consistency that has earned them the tag of the best team in the world in this format. Australia were well short, 350 may have been a par score but as soon as they struggled in the second half of their innings, India took the momentum and confidence of having to chase less into the second innings. No recovery from there. Australia have now lost another game on the road - they have now not won one game in their last 13 away from home.
Presentation time.
Steven Smith: "We set it up beautifully, the first 37-38 overs. Put in ourselves a good position. Indian bowlers executed well, we executed poorly. We needed 330 plus, Hardik was magnificent in end there. Finchy played magnificently, the wicket slowed up a little bit for both teams. The ball came on for the first 35 overs in both innings, but the slowed up, when it did for us, we weren't good enough."
Virat Kohli: "Steve mentioned the first 35 overs was good from their end, we knew when we get 2-3 wickets with their lower middle order, we could pull things back. It was a 330-340 wicket. Coming back from difficult situations has been a feature of this team. Wristspinners need to be backed, they won't always get grip from the wicket, but they possess the ability to get wickets. They were 35-40 runs short. I'm really, really satisfied with the win. He's (Pandya) a star, has the ability with the ball, bat and the field. We need a guy like that, we've been missing an explosive allrounder, great asset for Indian cricket, The idea behind his promotion was Ravi bhai, to attack the spinner. We might try few players now, but mindset remains the same. Journey stops only after the fifth game."
Hardik Pandya is the Man of the Match: "Feels pretty good, would like to finish the game next time. I don't need to be surprised, important to back myself, saw it as an opportunity. I wanted to target the left-arm spinner, when I got a few sixes, I knew I could take some time. I try to contribute everywhere I can, I want to get better."
47.5;1;Kane Richardson to Pandey, 1 run a french cut to finish. A yorker on leg, skewed between his legs for a run to square leg. And India now become the No. 1 ODI team in the world and finish off this series as quickly as possible.;
47.4;1;Kane Richardson to Dhoni, 1 run short on off, pulled down to fine leg. Dhoni does what Dhoni does. Onto you;
47.3;1;Kane Richardson to Pandey, 1 run a low full toss, whipped away to deep square leg. The crowd is happy with just one.;
47.2;?;Kane Richardson to Pandey, no run short of a length outside off, pulled to midwicket;
47.1;4;Kane Richardson to Pandey, FOUR runs that's a boundary. Full and wide from Richardson, Pandey clears his front leg and nails his lofted drive over the bowler. Stunning timing and power;
46.6;?;Maxwell to Dhoni, no run driven away with the spin to midwicket. Two off the over, but not good enough for Australia;
46.5;?;Maxwell to Dhoni, no run whipped away to square leg again, nice and calm, soaking in the chants;

45.3;?;Cummins to Hardik, no run good length on leg, follows Pandya, defended;
45.2;?;Cummins to Hardik, no run wild. Full outside off, Pandya has done anything he wants this innings, so he tries a no-look swing, but fails to connect.;

44.6;1;Stoinis to Hardik, 1 run dabbed towards third man for a run;
44.5;4;Stoinis to Hardik, FOUR runs a tad short on middle and leg and Pandya muscles the pull through midwicket. Fantastic stroke-making;
44.4;4;Stoinis to Hardik, FOUR runs what a shot. A short slow delivery on off, Pandey doesn't change the way the bat is moving, he just adjusts the bat to ensure the ball hits the bat, so that the ball doesn't go to third man. Instead, it goes right over the keeper. That is the perfect ramp shot;
44.3;1;Stoinis to Pandey, 1 run another short cutter on off and middle, think Mike and Bob Bryan's touch volley and think Pandey's touch forehand push to long-on. They aren't too much different. One to mid-on;
44.2;4;Stoinis to Pandey, FOUR runs that should be the game now. A short cutter again, far too predictable, sits up for Pandey to whack through midwicket. Too easy.;
44.1;4;Stoinis to Pandey, FOUR runs over mid-on. Full around off, Pandey wanted to go straight over the bowler's head but the ball skews off the inside half, the bat handle turns in his hands but who cares?;

42.5;4;Stoinis to Pandey, FOUR runs gets the gap and on this outfield, it's four all night long. Full and wide, slapped through cover for four. Used the pace and deflected the ball where he wanted;
42.4;?;Stoinis to Pandey, no run nudged to midwicket;
42.3;2;Stoinis to Pandey, 2 runs a short cutter again, a thick leading edge lobs towards fine leg. Good stop from the fielder at fine leg. A couple more. A forehand slap;

41.3;4;Cummins to Hardik, FOUR runs just wide of the stumps and that's four. Full and wide outside off, a thick inside edge somehow evades the stumps and races away down to fine leg. Terrific bowling, just enough lateral movement;

41.1;?;Cummins to Hardik, no run good length outside off, dabbed towards cover, 136 kph. Well improvised again;

38.3;6;Agar to Hardik, SIX runs six more! He's not bothered about the previous failure. Runs to the pitch and smashes it over long-on. Quick footwork. Proper power;
38.2;1;Agar to Pandey, 1 run short and wide outside off, punched to deep point;
38.1;?;Agar to Pandey, no run full on leg, blocked to mid-on. Good captaincy from Smith to keep mid-on up;
37.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Hardik, no run good improvisation from Pandya. Wants to pull but the ball is not there to do so, so he defends it back. Something Jadhav did not do;

37.4;?;Coulter-Nile to Pandey, no run full on leg, clipped to mid-on;
37.3;4;Coulter-Nile to Pandey, FOUR runs terrific power. 138 kph, full around off, Pandey smashes his drive back past the bowler. Mid-off and mid-on both are in. Not quite timed;
37.2;4;Coulter-Nile to Pandey, FOUR runs tripe from Coulter-Nile, short down leg and Pandey gets off the mark with a whip through fine leg.;
37.1;1;Coulter-Nile to Hardik, 1 run worked away to deep midwicket this time.;
36.6;1;Agar to Hardik, 1 run dropped! A very tough catch for Smith, but they needed that. Flight outside off, Pandya wants to go straight but agar extracts some turn, the ball skews off the outside half and lobs towards a cover at the edge of the circle. Smith backtracks, gets underneath it and spills a hard chance.;
36.5;?;Agar to Hardik, no run 90 kph, slower on off, driven to cover. Well bowled;
36.4;4;Agar to Hardik, FOUR runs in the gap again. Short on middle and leg, 99 kph, too quick. Pandya gleefully pulls over midwicket. Stands there and admires the shot. The arrogance.;
36.3;?;Agar to Hardik, no run winds up but Agar bowls this wide outside off, slapped to cover;
36.2;6;Agar to Hardik, SIX runs picks the length, stays back and wallops a flat-batted six over midwicket. Does in Agar in the mind, Agar forced into a short length, and Pandya was waiting on the back foot;
36.1;?;Agar to Hardik, no run slow and straight, defended back to the bowler;
35.6;?;Kane Richardson to Pandey, no run full outside off, driven away to Warner again. No run. Just the one off the over and a wicket;

35.3;?;Kane Richardson to Pandey, no run 136 kph, full outside off, defended to backward point;
35.2;W;Kane Richardson to Jadhav, OUT got 'im. A poor shot. Short and wide outside off, coming back in, that ball is not nearly wide enough to cut, but Jadhav still goes through with the stroke.

35.1;1;Kane Richardson to Hardik, 1 run short and wide from Richardson, cut away to backward point. The fielder fumbled and Pandya wanted two, but Jadhav said no. I can think of a few batsmen who would have not been happy with that from Jadhav;

34.5;2;Agar to Jadhav, 2 runs a wild slog from Jadhav, came racing down at Agar but swings from outside the line, gets a thick inside edge to fine leg for two;
34.4;?;Agar to Jadhav, no run flight on off, defended back;
34.3;W;Agar to Kohli, OUT eeks, he's picked out long-on has Virat Kohli. Very full from Agar outside off, Kohli sees the length and wants to go over cover, but the bat comes down straight, as opposed to from slightly leg side, which means the ball skews off the inside half and lobs to Finch at long-off. That's a rare mistake from Kohli, won't be happy with the dead ball either;Virat Kohli c Finch b Agar 28 (58m 35b 2x4 0x6) SR: 80;
34.2;?;Agar to Kohli, no run on the pads, flicked away to midwicket from the crease;

5.43pm Hello, again. Thanks, Nikhil. From 224 for 1, Australia had slumped to 275 for 6. The visitors managed only 38 in their last six overs to finish with a below-par 293 for 6. Will the pitch play better under lights as India's captain Virat Kohli suggested at the toss? India need 294 to wrap up the series. Rohit walks out to bat with Rahane. Cummins is armed with the new ball. He tears in from over the wicket with two slips to back him up
Shawry: "Hey Gents, first off, love your work. I think Australia got this all wrong with the batting line up after the 2nd wicket fell. I think Handscomb should of come in at 4 and then Head after that. That peaves Maxwell and Stoinis to unleash in the remaining 5-8 overs. Poor captaincy In my opinion "
Robin: "Did anyone noticed that both Bhumrah and Bhuvi conceded 52 runs, bowled 31 dots and conceded 4 fours." --- Good spot
