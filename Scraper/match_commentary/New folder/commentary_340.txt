8.3;?;Faulkner to Hales, no run very nearly a mix up, and a direct hit from Faulkner would have seen Hales run out by a mile - he had got an inside edge on a pull, maybe taken a blow on the box and stood and watched it as it dropped to the pitch, Lumb had come charging down and Hales had to set off at the last minute as the bowler followed through;
8.2;1;Faulkner to Lumb, 1 run advances and swats a length ball down the ground back past the bowler;
8.1;1;Faulkner to Hales, 1 run clipped off the pads through the leg side;
7.6;1lb;Fawad to Hales, 1 leg bye skidding on towards leg stump, plays across the line, another leg bye;
7.5;1lb;Fawad to Lumb, 1 leg bye legbreak, skidding towards leg stump, pitched outside though and they pick up one as the ball rolls past Wade;
7.4;?;Fawad to Lumb, no run looped up on leg stump, Lumb sweeps across the line and it hits the boot, bounces high into the leg side where Wade catches it - there's an appeal but no bat or glove adjudged to be involved;
7.3;1;Fawad to Hales, 1 run length ball, straightening on leg stump, tucked through square;
7.2;4;Fawad to Hales, FOUR runs floated up wide of off stump, lovely stroke from Hales, opening the face to guide the ball through backward point to the boundary;
7.1;?;Fawad to Hales, no run tossed up and pushed into the off side;
6.6;2;Watson to Lumb, 2 runs skips forward, opens the shoulders and drills through the covers, beats the man on the ring for a couple more;
6.5;1;Watson to Hales, 1 run gets the full-bunger in, dug out behind square on the off side;
6.4;1;Watson to Lumb, 1 run full again but wider this time and carved over cover to the sweeper;
6.3;6;Watson to Lumb, SIX runs mind the windows! Me oh my, that's gone a long way, right in the slot and brutalised over long-on by Lumb. He's had his Weetabix this morning;
6.2;1;Watson to Hales, 1 run outside off, goes back and opens the face for a single behind point;
6.1;2;Watson to Hales, 2 runs punched down the ground, towards long-on but he has to come in and they get two;
5.6;2;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, 2 runs slightly short outside off, drops back and steers a couple through point;
5.5;4;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, FOUR runs another malevolent swipe across the line from Lumb, such a strong batsmen and he flicks a length ball forcefully off his pads in front of deep midwicket for consecutive boundaries;
5.4;4;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, FOUR runs this is dismissive stuff, walking down the wicket and clubbing a length ball over mid-on, just clears the man and skids away;
5.3;1;Coulter-Nile to Hales, 1 run short and outside off, stays back and gets on top of a drive towards point, who is set back and they get one;
5.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Hales, no run fuller length and punched into the off side;
5.1;4;Coulter-Nile to Hales, FOUR runs dug in short, swings hard across the line and top-edged over the keeper for four. Hard to stop those!;
4.6;1;Faulkner to Hales, 1 run on the pads, gets a thin edge and they pick up one to midwicket, despite a moment's hesitation;
4.5;4;Faulkner to Hales, FOUR runs closes the face and crunches in front of square, nothing more than a glance really, but it beats the fielder in the deep, despite a good, full-length effort;
4.4;6;Faulkner to Hales, SIX runs well, he's genuinely got hold of that one ... clears the front foot, hits through the line and deposits Faulkner (not literally) high over long-on for the first six of the match;
4.3;?;Faulkner to Hales, no run good length, pushed across and steered with an open face to backward point;
4.2;4;Faulkner to Hales, FOUR runs another boundary, Hales swatting across the line and getting far more edge than middle on it, the ball races to fine leg;
4.1;4;Faulkner to Hales, FOUR runs inside-edged past the stumps! Hales gets away with one, a Chinese cut that was a whisker from hitting the stumps, wrong-footed Wade and scuttled for four;
3.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, no run goes round the wicket, angled in and holding its line, nips past the outside edge;
3.5;?;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, no run length outside off, pushed square on the off side;
3.4;4;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, FOUR runs Lumb hoicks a length ball on the pads h-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g-h into the leg side, Glenn Maxwell does tremendously to get anywhere near it out at deep midwicket but misjudges the descent and dives past it as it bounces and then trickles over the rope;
3.3;1;Coulter-Nile to Hales, 1 run on the stumps, worked into the leg side for one;
3.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Hales, no run big appeal from Wade as Coulter-Nile beats the outside edge of Hales' bat ... but even the bowler didn't fancy that one;
3.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Hales, no run good length, outside off, punched into the covers on the front foot;
2.6;1;Johnson to Hales, 1 run pitched up and driven hard coming forwards, mid-off collects and throws but Hales was home;
2.5;?;Johnson to Hales, no run angled across on a length, Hales drives on the back foot, gets an inside edge towards midwicket;
2.4;?;Johnson to Hales, no run better line and length, not quite short enough to pull, played from in front of leg stump back down the track;
2.3;4;Johnson to Hales, FOUR runs drops short and this time he just uses the pace to pull round the corner, sends the ball skidding behind square this time;
2.2;4;Johnson to Hales, FOUR runs on the pads, Hales whips across the line and forces the ball to the boundary in front of deep square leg - Hales is off the mark;
2.1;?;Johnson to Hales, no run fullish-length ball, squirted into the covers from the crease;
1.6;?;Watson to Lumb, no run touch short, on the stumps, pulled to the man at midwicket;
1.5;2;Watson to Lumb, 2 runs clips this one off the pads, behind square and this time Warner fields without mishap;
1.4;4;Watson to Lumb, FOUR runs sits back and muscles a pull through midwicket, plenty of wood on that but still Warner should have cut it off on the boundary, somehow he slid over it, to the general delight of the crowd;
1.3;1lb;Watson to Hales, 1 leg bye on leg stump, short of a length ball deflects away off the pad;
1.2;1;Watson to Lumb, 1 run bit of width again, Lumb opens the shoulders and uppercuts over gully, down to third man;
1.1;4;Watson to Lumb, FOUR runs slightly back of a length and wide of the stumps, Lumb carves the ball through point with a whip-crack slash;
0.6;?;Johnson to Hales, no run speared across, back of a length and there's an energetic appeal as the ball darts past the outside edge - umpire not interested;
0.5;?;Johnson to Hales, no run decent bumper from Johnson, gets it up above Hales' eyeline, he crouches out of the way;
0.4;1;Johnson to Lumb, 1 run short, outside off and pulled, doesn't time it and the ball rolls slowly wide of mid-on;
0.3;?;Johnson to Lumb, no run kicking off a length, at the body and Lumb wears it on the thigh pad trying to play across the line;
0.2;?;Johnson to Lumb, no run slightly shorter, punched on the up in front of square, again picks out the fielder;
0.1;?;Johnson to Lumb, no run pitched up full outside off, Lumb plants the front foot and drills the ball straight to the man set slightly back at cover;

The teams are out, circus music of some sort blaring over the tannoy. Some children are holding flags. This is ennertainment, folks! Alex Hales and Michael Lumb are rigged up on the trapeze... Mitch Johnson has the ball.
"@ Richard Bridle - When you concede 248 runs, obviously what you need to do is change one of the batsmen..." Touche, I think is the term, Chris.
2.20pm: Joe Root has been chatting on Sky, he's got a bit of a fat lip - legacy of top-edging one into his chops on Thursday - but is otherwise all right. Understated as it was in comparison to Finch's effort, Root played a cracking hand the other night, didn't he? First T20I innings too. Reckon he'll do okay, that lad.
"Excellent! When your side loses so comprehensively, of course you wouldn't change it. And when you have such a talented player as Michael Carberry, of course you wouldn't want to play him. Good thinking, England, that you MUST continue for the Australia leg of the Ashes campaign. Normalcy will thus resume much more rapidly!" Richard Bridle isn't happy. Though, in defence, any time can get a tonking in T20 and just as likely reverse the result second time round. You'll just have to wait for the ODIs to see Carbs in action, Richard.
Here's John: "Probably an important toss to win but anyone expecting anything like Finch's innings from the previous game will be sadly disappointed if the earlier women's game is anything to go by." I think there may be one or two more boundaries, but point taken.
And Ganesh thinks Australia could do with a bit of England-like stability: "Hazelwood bowled beautifully in the first game, and he is dropped for this one. Fawad Ahmed is given a second chance despite a rather unimpressive debut! Australia's selections continue to baffle!" Why change the theme of the tour, though?
2.15pm: If the thought of Australia getting sixxy with it later on - as Will Smith might say, they've got the feel for the flavour of a crowd pleaser - isn't enough for you, there's a bit of a thriller going on in the County Championship up at Scarborough. Head over to live county blog for all the latest.
2.10pm: George Bailey has followed the lead of Charlotte Edwards, then - the England women kept Australia to 91 in their 20 overs, after winning the toss, and then knocked off the runs. Also instructive may be England's card against South Africa here last year. Put in to bat, they made just 118 and lost by seven wickets. Trivia fans might like to know that Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann both made their highest T20 scores in England's highest partnership for the eighth wicket in T20 in that match. Though two of those 'records' have since been surpassed, so, you know, not all that useful.
2pm: Australia have won the toss and will bowl, they've made one change, with Nathan Coulter-Nile in for Josh Hazlewood. England, meanwhile, are unchanged - so no Michael Carberry and Danny Briggs continues as the spinner.
England 1 Michael Lumb, 2 Alex Hales, 3 Luke Wright, 4 Eoin Morgan, 5 Joe Root, 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Jos Buttler (wk), 8 Stuart Broad (capt), 9 Steven Finn, 10 Danny Briggs, 11 Jade Dernbach
Australia 1 David Warner, 2 Aaron Finch, 3 Shaun Marsh, 4 Shane Watson, 5 Glenn Maxwell, 6 George Bailey (capt), 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 James Faulkner, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Nathan Coulter-Nile, 11 Fawad Ahmed
If you've forgotten what Finch-hitting looks like (and T20, like candy floss, can pass through the system pretty quickly), here's a link you might find informative.
1.55pm: Afternoon. Everyone set for another episode of the Brawny Bunch? Both sides might need a bit more than Popeye forearms to score on this pitch, if the earlier women's match, which England won by seven wickets, is anything to go by. A little bit more nuance won't do any harm, of course, in this, the second and final Twenty20 before a five-match ODI series. I'm Alan Gardner and I'll be joined by Andrew "Gnasher" McGlashan to count Aaron Finch's sixes today. You can read up on the pertinent details in our preview and we'll bring you news of the toss and teams in five minutes or so.
 Innings Start
England win by 27 runs and it was a very efficient all-round display. Batted powerfully, mostly bowled with verve and the fielding was solid. That means the series is shared 1-1. I really wish these one-day legs of tours were three matches of each length (20 and 50) because often these T20 series are drawn. Anyway. It's been an entertaining couple of games. Some excellent cricket on show. I'll bring you the presentation shortly.
George Bailey "We lost a couple of early wickets which put England on top. We had some good patches with the ball, I thought Fawad did really well. His pace was really good today. It was tough with that wind."
Stuart Broad "After losing the toss the guys adapted to conditions really well. To get 60 off the first six was a great effort. Today we didn't even need the powers of Buttler. You can't ask much more of Jade than the last two games. We wanted to take the wicket-taking options whenever we could. Both batting performances have been exceptional. We still need to nail our skills a bit better with the ball, but the wickets have been fantastic."
That just about wraps things up from today. We now move into ODI action; England travel to Ireland and Australia head up to Scotland with both those matches on Tuesday. England and Australia will then lock horns in five ODIs starting next Friday. We'll bring you all the action as always. For now, though, from myself and Alan Gardner it's goodbye.

19.4;1;Dernbach to Johnson, 1 run a yorker is dug out into the off side;
19.4;2nb;Dernbach to Fawad, (no ball) 1 run high full toss, called no-ball for over waist height so the catch at backward point won't count...Ahmed sliced it high into the off side. Well above waist height;
19.3;?;Dernbach to Fawad, no run he doesn't seem to keen to stay in line, gets a quick short delivery and is comprehensively beaten;
19.2;1;Dernbach to Johnson, 1 run a full slower ball, it pings out of the middle of Johnson's bat but straight to long-on;
19.1;1;Dernbach to Fawad, 1 run short at the body, fended away backward of square;
18.6;?;Finn to Johnson, no run round the wicket, another slower ball, and Johnson only finds fresh air as he tries to carve it through the off side;
18.5;W;Finn to Coulter-Nile, OUT the short ball works, down at 75mph, and it takes the top edge to short fine-leg...Finn came back very well after those two sixes;Nathan Coulter-Nile c Briggs b Finn 13 (6m 6b 0x4 2x6) SR: 216.66;
18.4;?;Finn to Coulter-Nile, no run quicker this time, 87mph, and it's back-of-a-length again which beats Coulter-Nile for pace;
18.3;?;Finn to Coulter-Nile, no run that's brave...sends down a slower ball, back of a length, and it beats Coulter-Nile as he aims another pull;
18.2;6;Finn to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs back-to-back sixes! Is this game still on? Short this time from Finn and he pulls it over the long-leg boundary;
18.1;6;Finn to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs blimey, that's big! Finn offers up a length delivery and Coulter-Nile reminds everyone he can clear the ropes as he launches over deep midwicket. Wasn't even out of the middle!;
17.6;?;Dernbach to Johnson, no run full, wide, swing and a miss...an over that sealed the match from Dernbach;
17.5;1;Dernbach to Coulter-Nile, 1 run short again, angled into the body, 88mph, pulled down to long leg;
17.4;1;Dernbach to Johnson, 1 run full, outside off, driven powerfully out to deep cover...perhaps not the best ball on a hat-trick;
17.3;W;Dernbach to Faulkner, OUT what a catch! Superb from Morgan at backward point. It was a very sharp bouncer, Faulkner was in a horrid tangle as he tried to pull. Comes off the shoulder of the bat and it appeared it would fly just over Morgan, but he turned then pulled out a big leap to hold the catch;James Faulkner c Morgan b Dernbach 5 (9m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100;
17.2;W;Dernbach to Maxwell, OUT that's the end of his fun. He flicks a low full toss straight down the throat of deep square-leg who barely had to take a step either way;Glenn Maxwell c Lumb b Dernbach 27 (17m 16b 2x4 1x6) SR: 168.75;
17.1;?;Dernbach to Maxwell, no run beaten first up, basically he missed his drive at a length delivery;
16.6;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run low full toss, Bopara lucky it only costs a single as Maxwell pings it to deep square leg;
16.5;4;Bopara to Maxwell, FOUR runs this time Finn gets beaten, good over for Australia, Maxwell picks up a length delivery and lofts it straight down the ground;
16.4;2;Bopara to Maxwell, 2 runs now he flat-bat pulls this straight down the ground, Finn does well to get around from long-on and hands the ball to Morgan who hurls it back;
16.3;4;Bopara to Maxwell, FOUR runs that is plastered through the off side, short of a length and it sat up for Maxwell who moved to leg and slammed it over cover;
16.2;2;Bopara to Maxwell, 2 runs this is a touch fuller, but Maxwell still pulls - and almost swings himself off his feet - this time through midwicket;
16.1;6;Bopara to Maxwell, SIX runs dropped in short and Maxwell helps himself to a full count over deep square-leg;
15.6;?;Briggs to Faulkner, no run well bowled by Briggs, cramps Faulkner for room as it comes in with the arm and he can only push it back to the bowler;
15.5;?;Briggs to Faulkner, no run quicker ball, Faulkner cuts it hard but picks out backward point;
15.4;4;Briggs to Faulkner, FOUR runs lovely shot, a more controlled version of what Maxwell was trying, moves outside leg stump then goes inside-out over cover;
15.3;1;Briggs to Maxwell, 1 run steps to leg and hammers this through the off side...finds long off;
15.2;1;Briggs to Faulkner, 1 run full at the stumps, driven down the ground;
15.1;W;Briggs to Wade, OUT and another...round the wicket, a quicker delivery skids through and beats Wade's attempt at a pull;Matthew Wade b Briggs 4 (7m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
14.6;?;Bopara to Maxwell, no run slower ball to end the over, 66mph, and Maxwell is through his shot, getting a bottom edge into his pads;
14.5;2;Bopara to Maxwell, 2 runs gets a bit more behind this pull through midwicket;
14.4;2;Bopara to Maxwell, 2 runs short, wide and fairly slow...the lack of pace means it's hard work for the batsman to swing it through midwicket;
14.3;1;Bopara to Wade, 1 run well bowled, another slower ball, 64mph, and it almost provides a return catch as it loops off a leading edge when Wade is through his shot early;
14.2;2;Bopara to Wade, 2 runs round the wicket, back of a length, bunted down to long-on and they get their skates on between the stumps;
14.1;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length, Maxwell aims to the leg side but the ball ends up down at long-off;
13.6;1;Briggs to Maxwell, 1 run uses his feet and crunches this down to long-off...reached the fielder in a split second. Still only worth one, mind;
13.5;1;Briggs to Wade, 1 run stays round the wicket, worked from off stump through the leg side;
13.4;W;Briggs to Bailey, OUT he gets one! Bailey misses his sweep and (umpire) Bailey gives the decision. Didn't look dead straight. Well, that was dead straight. Hawk Eye shows hitting middle and leg full on.;George Bailey lbw b Briggs 23 (16m 13b 1x4 1x6) SR: 176.92;

12.5;2;Dernbach to Warner, 2 runs oh dear, Finn has made a mess of this at long-off! Warner sent a length delivery miles into the air - there's a tricky wind today - Finn called early but never looked confident and in the end was nowhere near it. Root, a better fielder, was the other man close by;
12.4;?;Dernbach to Warner, no run sharp bouncer this time, 86mph, and it beats Warner's fierce attempt at a hook...close to a wide, actially;
12.3;1;Dernbach to Bailey, 1 run dragged down short and wide but it only costs a single as Bailey toe-ends it out to deep cover;
12.2;2;Dernbach to Bailey, 2 runs doesn't quite middle this as he goes over extra cover to a length delivery but it falls well short of deep cover;
12.1;1;Dernbach to Warner, 1 run slower ball, 70mph, outside off, driven out to deep cover;
12.1;1w;Dernbach to Warner, 1 wide short ball down the leg side, Dernbach had adjusted to see Warner move around his crease but it's still called;
11.6;2;Root to Bailey, 2 runs more deft placement, and quick runner, as Bailey places it through midwicket...Root tries to chase it down but neither he nor long-on can prevent the second. The run out is check - Buttler flicked the ball into the stumps - but Warner was well home;
11.5;1;Root to Warner, 1 run onto the back foot, tucked through midwicket and that takes him to fifty off 38 balls;
11.4;1;Root to Bailey, 1 run on leg stump, worked straight to deep square;
11.3;2;Root to Bailey, 2 runs worked off the stumps again, this time squarer and again it's placed perfectly for a second;
11.2;2;Root to Bailey, 2 runs stays round the wicket, short of a length, flicked off the back foot through midwicket and they hurtle between the sticks;
11.1;1;Root to Warner, 1 run driven through the covers, they think of a second but the throw from Wright at long-off is already on its way it;
10.6;6;Broad to Bailey, SIX runs he's not hang around, picks up a length delivery and flicks it well over the deep midwicket rope...went with the wind, which helped it carry miles;
10.5;2;Broad to Bailey, 2 runs Broad responds by going short, Bailey cloths it down to fine leg with a pull and the lack of pace on the shot allows him back for a second;
10.4;4;Broad to Bailey, FOUR runs that's a cracker...after two dot balls he drives a floaty, full delivery straight down the ground;
10.3;?;Broad to Bailey, no run a hint of swing into Bailey who clips it from off stump to midwicket;
10.2;?;Broad to Bailey, no run full at off stump, defended to cover;
10.1;1;Broad to Warner, 1 run short of a length, Warner stands on leg stump and unleashes his forearms to power this out to deep cover;
9.6;W;Root to Marsh, OUT bowled him, hitting across the line again! Marsh maybe didn't need to go big again in that over but he was feeling the pressure - he missed and Root hit, England break the stand;Shaun Marsh b Root 13 (30m 14b 0x4 1x6) SR: 92.85;
9.5;?;Root to Marsh, no run flat and on the stumps, played from the crease into the covers;
9.4;6;Root to Marsh, SIX runs nailed this one, down on one knee and heaved out towards deep midwicket, signs of aggression from Marsh;
9.3;?;Root to Marsh, no run plays across the pad and misses;
9.2;1lb;Root to Warner, 1 leg bye skidding on with the arm and Warner is struck on the pads in front of leg stump, Root appeals but probably sliding past;

8.2;1w;Bopara to Warner, 1 wide slower ball, down the leg side - wide;

7.1;2;Root to Marsh, 2 runs stays back and thrashes a couple through the covers from the crease;
6.6;?;Briggs to Warner, no run flatter and quicker and Warner gets hit on the body as he comes forward again;
6.5;6;Briggs to Warner, SIX runs smashed! Warner advances and slogs with impunity, there's a man at long-on but even Morgan on his tip-toes can't grab that one - six!;
6.4;4;Briggs to Warner, FOUR runs skips out and throws the hands through a rasping drive that beats the man at cover - four more;
6.3;?;Briggs to Warner, no run gets away with a long hop that Warner drags into the ground;

5.3;?;Dernbach to Warner, no run pushed across, played into the off side;
5.2;6;Dernbach to Warner, SIX runs sixer, over long-on! Too full and in the whacking zone from Dernbach, Warner seized on it and boinged the ball over the rope;
5.1;?;Dernbach to Warner, no run length ball, pushes back and it's wide of Dernbach before landing safely on the cut strip;
4.6;1lb;Finn to Warner, 1 leg bye back of a length, on the pads and it rolls away off the hip as Warner tries to glance;

3.1;4;Broad to Warner, FOUR runs Warner isn't going to take this reclining and he advances to bosh a cross-batted swipe past mid-on for his first boundary;
2.6;?;Finn to Marsh, no run beaten again, another snorter and rises sharply just outside off, Marsh helpless;
2.5;?;Finn to Marsh, no run ooh, jaffa first up from Finn to Marsh, seaming and bouncing past the outside edge as the batsman poked at it;
2.4;W;Finn to Watson, OUT superb bit fielding from Morgan, a direct hit from backward point and Watson is gone for all money! He was sent back by Warner, never a run there, but Watson turned like a HGV backing up to a petrol pump, dived for the crease but Morgan's throw was on target, bouncing and shattering the stumps with the bat well short;Shane Watson run out (Morgan) 7 (6m 6b 1x4 0x6) SR: 116.66;
2.3;4;Finn to Watson, FOUR runs little bit short from Finn and Watson comes hard at him, swatting a top-spin forehand over mid-on, lovely clean hitting from Watto;
2.2;?;Finn to Watson, no run touch fuller, steps outside off and drives to mid-off;
2.1;2;Finn to Watson, 2 runs length ball outside off, comes forward and drives away from the body through a gap in front of point for a couple;

1.3;?;Broad to Watson, no run gets across and defends a length ball on the stumps;
1.2;W;Broad to Finch, OUT swats across the line, top-edged and the ball loops tamely to mid-on! England have slain the beast! Everyone was expecting him to go after the bowlers again and Finch is always going to live and die by the sword. Although it was more like the pen knife this time... Maybe not quite short enough to pull and Broad gets him;Aaron Finch c Wright b Broad 5 (6m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100;
1.1;4;Broad to Finch, FOUR runs pitched up outside off, not a half-volley but hit cleanly on the up over mid-off for four;

0.5;?;Finn to Finch, no run Finn pummels the ball into the pitch short and fast and it climbs past Finch's nose as he swings and misses;
0.4;1;Finn to Warner, 1 run fuller, around middle and off stump, gets forward and pushes fine of mid-off for one;
0.3;?;Finn to Warner, no run length, tight line on the stumps, Warner blocks back towards mid-on;

19.5;?;Dernbach to Fawad, no run banged in short again, Ahmed aims over midwicket but is beaten;
19.4;1;Dernbach to Johnson, 1 run a yorker is dug out into the off side;
19.4;2nb;Dernbach to Fawad, (no ball) 1 run high full toss, called no-ball for over waist height so the catch at backward point won't count...Ahmed sliced it high into the off side. Well above waist height;
19.3;?;Dernbach to Fawad, no run he doesn't seem to keen to stay in line, gets a quick short delivery and is comprehensively beaten;
19.2;1;Dernbach to Johnson, 1 run a full slower ball, it pings out of the middle of Johnson's bat but straight to long-on;
19.1;1;Dernbach to Fawad, 1 run short at the body, fended away backward of square;
18.6;?;Finn to Johnson, no run round the wicket, another slower ball, and Johnson only finds fresh air as he tries to carve it through the off side;
18.5;W;Finn to Coulter-Nile, OUT the short ball works, down at 75mph, and it takes the top edge to short fine-leg...Finn came back very well after those two sixes;Nathan Coulter-Nile c Briggs b Finn 13 (6m 6b 0x4 2x6) SR: 216.66;
18.4;?;Finn to Coulter-Nile, no run quicker this time, 87mph, and it's back-of-a-length again which beats Coulter-Nile for pace;
18.3;?;Finn to Coulter-Nile, no run that's brave...sends down a slower ball, back of a length, and it beats Coulter-Nile as he aims another pull;
18.2;6;Finn to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs back-to-back sixes! Is this game still on? Short this time from Finn and he pulls it over the long-leg boundary;
18.1;6;Finn to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs blimey, that's big! Finn offers up a length delivery and Coulter-Nile reminds everyone he can clear the ropes as he launches over deep midwicket. Wasn't even out of the middle!;
17.6;?;Dernbach to Johnson, no run full, wide, swing and a miss...an over that sealed the match from Dernbach;
17.5;1;Dernbach to Coulter-Nile, 1 run short again, angled into the body, 88mph, pulled down to long leg;
17.4;1;Dernbach to Johnson, 1 run full, outside off, driven powerfully out to deep cover...perhaps not the best ball on a hat-trick;
17.3;W;Dernbach to Faulkner, OUT what a catch! Superb from Morgan at backward point. It was a very sharp bouncer, Faulkner was in a horrid tangle as he tried to pull. Comes off the shoulder of the bat and it appeared it would fly just over Morgan, but he turned then pulled out a big leap to hold the catch;James Faulkner c Morgan b Dernbach 5 (9m 5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100;
17.2;W;Dernbach to Maxwell, OUT that's the end of his fun. He flicks a low full toss straight down the throat of deep square-leg who barely had to take a step either way;Glenn Maxwell c Lumb b Dernbach 27 (17m 16b 2x4 1x6) SR: 168.75;
17.1;?;Dernbach to Maxwell, no run beaten first up, basically he missed his drive at a length delivery;
16.6;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run low full toss, Bopara lucky it only costs a single as Maxwell pings it to deep square leg;
16.5;4;Bopara to Maxwell, FOUR runs this time Finn gets beaten, good over for Australia, Maxwell picks up a length delivery and lofts it straight down the ground;
16.4;2;Bopara to Maxwell, 2 runs now he flat-bat pulls this straight down the ground, Finn does well to get around from long-on and hands the ball to Morgan who hurls it back;
16.3;4;Bopara to Maxwell, FOUR runs that is plastered through the off side, short of a length and it sat up for Maxwell who moved to leg and slammed it over cover;
16.2;2;Bopara to Maxwell, 2 runs this is a touch fuller, but Maxwell still pulls - and almost swings himself off his feet - this time through midwicket;
16.1;6;Bopara to Maxwell, SIX runs dropped in short and Maxwell helps himself to a full count over deep square-leg;
15.6;?;Briggs to Faulkner, no run well bowled by Briggs, cramps Faulkner for room as it comes in with the arm and he can only push it back to the bowler;
15.5;?;Briggs to Faulkner, no run quicker ball, Faulkner cuts it hard but picks out backward point;
15.4;4;Briggs to Faulkner, FOUR runs lovely shot, a more controlled version of what Maxwell was trying, moves outside leg stump then goes inside-out over cover;
15.3;1;Briggs to Maxwell, 1 run steps to leg and hammers this through the off side...finds long off;
15.2;1;Briggs to Faulkner, 1 run full at the stumps, driven down the ground;
15.1;W;Briggs to Wade, OUT and another...round the wicket, a quicker delivery skids through and beats Wade's attempt at a pull;Matthew Wade b Briggs 4 (7m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 100;
14.6;?;Bopara to Maxwell, no run slower ball to end the over, 66mph, and Maxwell is through his shot, getting a bottom edge into his pads;
14.5;2;Bopara to Maxwell, 2 runs gets a bit more behind this pull through midwicket;
14.4;2;Bopara to Maxwell, 2 runs short, wide and fairly slow...the lack of pace means it's hard work for the batsman to swing it through midwicket;
14.3;1;Bopara to Wade, 1 run well bowled, another slower ball, 64mph, and it almost provides a return catch as it loops off a leading edge when Wade is through his shot early;
14.2;2;Bopara to Wade, 2 runs round the wicket, back of a length, bunted down to long-on and they get their skates on between the stumps;
14.1;1;Bopara to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length, Maxwell aims to the leg side but the ball ends up down at long-off;
13.6;1;Briggs to Maxwell, 1 run uses his feet and crunches this down to long-off...reached the fielder in a split second. Still only worth one, mind;
13.5;1;Briggs to Wade, 1 run stays round the wicket, worked from off stump through the leg side;
13.4;W;Briggs to Bailey, OUT he gets one! Bailey misses his sweep and (umpire) Bailey gives the decision. Didn't look dead straight. Well, that was dead straight. Hawk Eye shows hitting middle and leg full on.;George Bailey lbw b Briggs 23 (16m 13b 1x4 1x6) SR: 176.92;
13.3;1;Briggs to Maxwell, 1 run goes for the reverse sweep, it's a straight delivery, gets a bottom edge to short third-man;

13.1;1;Briggs to Bailey, 1 run drifts into leg stump, flicked to deep square;
12.6;W;Dernbach to Warner, OUT gone this time! It hasn't proved costly, though. Warner slices a short delivery flat out to deep cover where Hales held the catch coming in off the boundary;David Warner c Hales b Dernbach 53 (56m 42b 5x4 3x6) SR: 126.19;
12.5;2;Dernbach to Warner, 2 runs oh dear, Finn has made a mess of this at long-off! Warner sent a length delivery miles into the air - there's a tricky wind today - Finn called early but never looked confident and in the end was nowhere near it. Root, a better fielder, was the other man close by;
12.4;?;Dernbach to Warner, no run sharp bouncer this time, 86mph, and it beats Warner's fierce attempt at a hook...close to a wide, actially;
12.3;1;Dernbach to Bailey, 1 run dragged down short and wide but it only costs a single as Bailey toe-ends it out to deep cover;
12.2;2;Dernbach to Bailey, 2 runs doesn't quite middle this as he goes over extra cover to a length delivery but it falls well short of deep cover;
12.1;1;Dernbach to Warner, 1 run slower ball, 70mph, outside off, driven out to deep cover;
12.1;1w;Dernbach to Warner, 1 wide short ball down the leg side, Dernbach had adjusted to see Warner move around his crease but it's still called;
11.6;2;Root to Bailey, 2 runs more deft placement, and quick runner, as Bailey places it through midwicket...Root tries to chase it down but neither he nor long-on can prevent the second. The run out is check - Buttler flicked the ball into the stumps - but Warner was well home;
11.5;1;Root to Warner, 1 run onto the back foot, tucked through midwicket and that takes him to fifty off 38 balls;
11.4;1;Root to Bailey, 1 run on leg stump, worked straight to deep square;
11.3;2;Root to Bailey, 2 runs worked off the stumps again, this time squarer and again it's placed perfectly for a second;
11.2;2;Root to Bailey, 2 runs stays round the wicket, short of a length, flicked off the back foot through midwicket and they hurtle between the sticks;
11.1;1;Root to Warner, 1 run driven through the covers, they think of a second but the throw from Wright at long-off is already on its way it;
10.6;6;Broad to Bailey, SIX runs he's not hang around, picks up a length delivery and flicks it well over the deep midwicket rope...went with the wind, which helped it carry miles;
10.5;2;Broad to Bailey, 2 runs Broad responds by going short, Bailey cloths it down to fine leg with a pull and the lack of pace on the shot allows him back for a second;
10.4;4;Broad to Bailey, FOUR runs that's a cracker...after two dot balls he drives a floaty, full delivery straight down the ground;
10.3;?;Broad to Bailey, no run a hint of swing into Bailey who clips it from off stump to midwicket;
10.2;?;Broad to Bailey, no run full at off stump, defended to cover;
10.1;1;Broad to Warner, 1 run short of a length, Warner stands on leg stump and unleashes his forearms to power this out to deep cover;
9.6;W;Root to Marsh, OUT bowled him, hitting across the line again! Marsh maybe didn't need to go big again in that over but he was feeling the pressure - he missed and Root hit, England break the stand;Shaun Marsh b Root 13 (30m 14b 0x4 1x6) SR: 92.85;
9.5;?;Root to Marsh, no run flat and on the stumps, played from the crease into the covers;
9.4;6;Root to Marsh, SIX runs nailed this one, down on one knee and heaved out towards deep midwicket, signs of aggression from Marsh;
9.3;?;Root to Marsh, no run plays across the pad and misses;
9.2;1lb;Root to Warner, 1 leg bye skidding on with the arm and Warner is struck on the pads in front of leg stump, Root appeals but probably sliding past;
9.2;1w;Root to Warner, 1 wide flat and drifting behind Warner - another wide;
9.1;1lb;Root to Marsh, 1 leg bye pushed down the leg side, runs away off the pad;
8.6;?;Bopara to Warner, no run sliding down the leg side, clipped firmly but straight to the man at 45;
8.5;2;Bopara to Warner, 2 runs length, worked off the pads through midwicket, the man comes in off the fence and they get two;

8.3;1;Bopara to Marsh, 1 run pulls across the line and gets one through backward square;
8.3;1w;Bopara to Marsh, 1 wide back of the hand again, taking the pace off, wide of the tramlines as Marsh thinks about cutting;
8.2;1;Bopara to Warner, 1 run slightly short, on the stumps, Warner was coming forward and nudges it into a gap at midwicket;
8.2;1w;Bopara to Warner, 1 wide slower ball, down the leg side - wide;
8.1;1;Bopara to Marsh, 1 run outside off, length ball and pushed through the covers to the sweeper;
7.6;?;Root to Warner, no run short and skidding on, Warner cuts hard but gets a bottom edge, bounces up over the stumps and Buttler collects;
7.5;4;Root to Warner, FOUR runs lovely late cut from Warner, sitting back for to chop a slightly short ball behind point, Lumb makes a dive on the rope but the ball spins back and goes for four;
7.4;1;Root to Marsh, 1 run turned off the legs through midwicket;

7.1;2;Root to Marsh, 2 runs stays back and thrashes a couple through the covers from the crease;
6.6;?;Briggs to Warner, no run flatter and quicker and Warner gets hit on the body as he comes forward again;
6.5;6;Briggs to Warner, SIX runs smashed! Warner advances and slogs with impunity, there's a man at long-on but even Morgan on his tip-toes can't grab that one - six!;
6.4;4;Briggs to Warner, FOUR runs skips out and throws the hands through a rasping drive that beats the man at cover - four more;
6.3;?;Briggs to Warner, no run gets away with a long hop that Warner drags into the ground;

5.3;?;Dernbach to Warner, no run pushed across, played into the off side;
5.2;6;Dernbach to Warner, SIX runs sixer, over long-on! Too full and in the whacking zone from Dernbach, Warner seized on it and boinged the ball over the rope;
5.1;?;Dernbach to Warner, no run length ball, pushes back and it's wide of Dernbach before landing safely on the cut strip;
4.6;1lb;Finn to Warner, 1 leg bye back of a length, on the pads and it rolls away off the hip as Warner tries to glance;

Steven Finn is going to open to David Warner again
Hello everyone. A decent total from England, though, with Aaron Finch in their rearview mirror, they won't be too comfortable - and he doesn't need any help in looking big. However, Australia have only once chased anything like this total, during Mike Hussey's match against Pakistan in the 2010 World Twenty20 semi-finals.
