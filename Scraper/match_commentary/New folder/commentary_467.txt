Hello and welcome to this tour-match between South Africa A and Autralia from a sunny Potchefstroom.
Potchefstroom was of course the home-base for the Australian team in their succesful World Cup campaign back in 2003 and they should feel right at home.
News from the middle is that SA A have won the toss and elected to bat first, play is scheduled to start at 10h00 local time.
 Innings Start
De Lange leads the team of the field to a resounding cheer, receives the innings-ball from the umpires as well to keep. Excellent bowling from the young man picking up five and tearing thorugh the Aussie middle-order after getting Marsh as well.
