Data
Warner almost batted out the 50 overs, Australia are on top with an imposing score thanks to Warner's knock. There is some swing for the bowlers and some movement, and Sri Lanka face a difficult task to chase this down. Wade led the way with an attacking start and Warner dropped anchor to set up this total. Join us in another 30 minutes for the Sri Lankan reply.

Andrew: "@Jason, yeah, I get that he is still a youngster, but he seems uncomfortable against the new ball, and (more worryingly) he hasn't been all that flash with the gloves. I'm sure he is a better bet for the future than Haddin, but isn't there anyone else?"
It's still drizzling, but not enough to force the players off the field
 Innings Start
An exciting finish to a game that appeared to be one-sided when Sri Lanka were reduced to 144 for 6 in the chase. Kulasekara triggered the fightback in the company of Tharanga, the former the aggressor and Tharanga the anchor who was expected to stay on till the end. Prasad kept the fight on with Tharanga but Tharanga's wicket was the decisive blow, as he holed out trying to bring down the required rate further. Australia will be happy at the win but would be disappointed at the same time, not being able to shut out their opponents after having gained the upper hand quite early into the chase. They also faltered in the field, dropping catches and missing several run-out attempts. But, in the end, they held their nerve and won.
Brydon Coverdale's report is being updated. We'll get you the details from the presentation ceremony in a bit.
Jayawardene: "We've been playing some really good cricket, we fought till the end. It's a good attitude to have. It was an incredible partnership. Kula did very well, lots of positives for us to take from this. When Upul got out, that probably put us back a bit. If there was a batsman left till the end, who knows? They took the momentum up front, that's something we need to improve on. The guys are fighting for everything."
Clarke: "I'm pleased we won the game, but we've got some work to do tomorrow. They continue not to quit unfortunately, they are very well-skilled. But Warner and Wade were outstanding at the top. We got to the Adelaide Oval which will probably suit the Sri Lankans more than the Gabba. Watson saved us once again, we are glad to have him back in the team, this effort shows his class."
Warner is Man of the MAtch: "I needed some runs on the board, we set ourselves some targets there. Dave Huss missed out but he picked up four wickets. I was just a little worried about the cramps at the other end, I was getting some treatment. I couldn't move sideways so we're going to do a fitness test on the day of the game. It's good to get across the line, we are now 1-0 up."
That's all from us here folks, many thanks for tuning in and sending us your feedback. It was a riveting first final though it didn't appear so riveting when Sri Lanka were 144 for 6, but Tharanga and lower order gave us a final worth remembering. We move to Adelaide for the next final, on March 6. See you then. Goodbye.
