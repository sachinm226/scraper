Data
Right, well New Zealand will be rather pleased with their effort to restrict Australia to under 300. Most of the Australian batsmen got starts but they seemed to struggle with the pace of the wicket at times and were unable to push on. Some good death bowling from Southee and Bond complemented the earlier efforts of Tuffey and Franklin.
Join us in 30 minutes when New Zealand begin their chase against a very very good Australian pace attack. It will be interesting to see how much of a difference Doug Bollinger makes after not playing the T20Is.
Can McCullum continue his recent run of form or will Bollinger, Harris and Johnson be far too good?

Franklin to change to around the wicket now
 Innings Start
New Zealand win by two wickets with four balls remaining. The pressure was on him towards the death and Styris comes through with a fantastic innings under pressure. Styris was a late inclusion when Daniel Vettori had to pull out with a neck complaint and he has justified his selection with a match-winning 49 not out off just 34 balls.
New Zealand always looked on target for victory with Ross Taylor at the wicket but when he was out from the bowling of Watson at 204 for five in the 39th over, New Zealand needed an old hand to stand up.
Australia's bowlers fought hard right to the end, with Bollinger taking the wickets of McCullum and Broom to give the visitors a real sniff. When Southee was run out at 246, New Zealand needed 30 off 22 deliveries. Bond joined Styris and Bond hit the boundary when required but it was Styris who will take all the accolades on an evening he will never forget.
Ponting felt his team didn't score enough runs due to the fact that nobody went on to make a big score after making a start. It is the first loss for Australia in their last 13 ODIs and Ponting is disapppointed but well aware they need to bounce back quickly for the match in Auckland on Saturday.
New Zealand's stand in captain Ross Taylor can't believe the position he is in, when at the start of the day he had no idea he would captain the side. He heaps praise on all of his players, especially Styris. The loss of Oram made it difficult for him rotating his bowlers however he did an admirable job by all accounts.
Ross Taylor also picks up the Man of the Match award for his run-a-ball 70 which anchored the chase. Styris will feel a little aggrieved for not picking up the award himself but I'm sure he will take enough from the match as it is.
New Zealand take a 1-0 series lead and we head to Auckland for game two on Saturday which starts at 1200 local time and 2300 GMT on Friday night.
Thanks for joining us today and tonight. On behalf of the crew here at Cricinfo, I would like to say goodnight and we look forward to next time. Bye for now.
