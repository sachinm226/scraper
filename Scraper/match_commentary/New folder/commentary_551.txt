Australia will settle for 250 and this target will really test Pakistan's sometimes brittle batting line-up. The fielding wasn't really up to the mark. Watson played a special knock against the spinners. That'll come as good news for the Rajasthan Royals as well.

14.55: Pakistan get together for the huddle. They need a repeat performance from the first ODI. Small crowd at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. Shoaib marks his run-up. It's also a very good evening to Peter English, Alex Malcolm and Raghav.
14.45: We're 15 minutes away from the start. Let's reflect on the series. It doesn't make good reading if you're a Pakistan fan - 1-3 down with a game to play. They will look back at the third ODI and blame it on the shocking collapse.
Nazia knocks on the door from UAE: "Best of luck Pakistan..and prove yourself that u are the best team..."
So Pakistan have only pride to play for in this dead rubber. Australia will be relieved to be in this position after a difficult ODI series in South Africa, which they lost.
Toss and teams: Australia have won the toss and they will bat first. They have made two changes - Nathan Bracken and Stuart Clark go out. The two Bens - Hilfenhaus and Laughlin - come in.
For Pakistan, Sohail Tanvir makes way for Umar Gul. That's it.
Australia: 1 Brad Haddin (wk), 2 Shane Watson, 3 Marcus North, 4 Michael Clarke (capt), 5 Andrew Symonds, 6 Callum Ferguson, 7 James Hopes, 8 Nathan Hauritz, 9 Ben Laughlin, 10 Ben Hilfenhaus, 11 Doug Bollinger.
Pakistan: 1 Salman Butt, 2 Ahmed Shehzad, 3 Younis Khan (capt), 4 Shoaib Malik, 5 Misbah-ul-Haq, 6 Shahid Afridi, 7 Kamran Akmal (wk), 8 Umar Gul, 9 Shoaib Akhtar, 10 Yasir Arafat, 11 Saeed Ajmal.
Hello everyone and welcome to the coverage of the fifth and final ODI between Pakistan and Australia at Abu Dhabi. The toss is just around the corner and we'll bring you the teams as well very shortly.
 Innings Start
Sorry for the confusion over the scoring. It's been sorted.
That ends a thoroughly professional chase by Pakistan. They have earned a consolation win and for once, their batsmen have done justice to themselves. Akmal and Misbah added 198 for the fourth wicket and as soon as they came together, set about ticking the runs away. They created opportunities, picked the gaps and constantly picked the singles, ensuring their stand was always above a run a ball.
Subhan, from Pakistan: "Its unbelievable how Pakistan chased today, truly amazing, is it the same team who failed to chase 200 on this pitch?
Whenever there are talks going on for replacing Akmal, he comes up with such an innings.. Its better selectors tell him before every match that it will be his last match.."
We'll cut to the presentation.
There are a million prizes to be won. This will take all night.
Akmal gets his Man of the Match award. " Misbah encouraged me. We clicked at the right time. Misbah talked to me after every over."
Clarke is the Man of the Series.
Younis: "The spinners did the job for us first. It was a team effort. We were talking about rotate the strike before the chase. They finished very well. Kamran has always done the job at the top of the order. I have learnt a lot from the Aussies in this series about handling pressure. This is a young team and they are gelling well."
Clarke: "It was another great. Full credit to Pakistan. With 250 we were still confident, we let ourselves down in the field. Watson deserved his century. I will return home so I will miss the Twenty20. Few of the guys will have a round of golf tomorrow."
The PCB has given a special award of Rs 500,000 for Kamran Akmal. Very generous gesture. This shows how much this win means for them.
Thanks for your company. Do join us for the one-off Twenty20 on May 7 in Dubai. This is Kanishkaa signing off. Cheers!
