Data
9.10pm: England's long tour continues to plough a slough of despond. That was a miserable batting display on a wicket both captains eyed up greedily at the toss. The aggression was naked but England's batsmen were left with barely a fig leaf to cover their wobbly bits by the end. Expect this to be another green-and-gold jamboree, as Victoria toasts its own... Alex will be back in 15 to see if the inevitable eventuates.
19.6;W;Hazlewood to Tredwell, OUT timber! Hazlewood has four! Full and straight does for Tredwell, who tried to launch his first ball down the ground and missed it completely. The stumps are a mess and so is this England innings;James Tredwell b Hazlewood 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
19.5;W;Hazlewood to Bresnan, OUT bowled him, via his legs!

19.4;3;Hazlewood to Broad, 3 runs Broad is swinging like kid in a playground, another skier flies out towards deep backward point, it bounces towards the rope where Maxwell swoops on it like condor, collect and tosses the ball to a team-mate superbly to prevent a boundary;
19.3;1;Hazlewood to Bresnan, 1 run fires this to leg as the batsman makes room, turned behind square;

19.1;3;Hazlewood to Broad, 3 runs carted high out towards long-off, a huge top edge from Broad, it lands beyond the fielder, though, just inside the rope, and they survive run-out chances at both ends to get back for three;
19.1;1w;Hazlewood to Broad, 1 wide Broad steps away, this is fired wide of the wicket in respone - too wide for the umpire;

16.1;4lb;Starc to Broad, 4 leg byes Broad backs to leg, Starc and Wade follow him and a short-of-a-length ball clips the thigh pad, beats Wade to his left and runs to the boundary - hundred up for England now;

What superb fielding. Looked for all money that an easy two was on but Maxwell covered the ground so quickly, dived to field and threw almost in one motion, right on target and White dashed the stumps down;Joe Root run out (Maxwell/White) 18 (19m 14b 3x4 0x6) SR: 128.57;

6.6;W;Maxwell to Root, OUT the same stroke but this time they take on extra-cover and a direct hit has Morgan struggling diving into the striker's end. His bat is well over the line but it's bounced in the air, are his gloves back in time? I don't think they are and indeed he's gone. Very unlucky that is for Morgan, the bat bounced up and all the way to the top of the handle was in the air as he crossed the whitewash. Top work from Hodge having run to his left;Eoin Morgan run out (Hodge) 6 (5m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 200;

5.5;2;Hazlewood to Root, 2 runs length on leg stump, clipped through square leg and they run hard for two;
5.4;W;Hazlewood to Hales, OUT full on the stumps, Hales aims a big swing towards the leg side and gets a huge top edge that swirls down to third man and Starc holds the chance very well. That hung in the air for a long time but Starc steadied himself just inside the boundary and took it down to his left with two hands;Alex Hales c Starc b Hazlewood 16 (24m 13b 3x4 0x6) SR: 123.07;

4.3;4;Starc to Root, FOUR runs too wide and Root begins perfectly with a nice cut stroke through point;

4.1;?;Starc to Wright, no run full length a foot wide of off stump, Wright drives and misses completely;
3.6;?;Hazlewood to Hales, no run down the track and a wild swing towards the leg side misses;
3.5;?;Hazlewood to Hales, no run full length outside off, Hales scythes it to cover point;
3.4;2;Hazlewood to Hales, 2 runs fuller length, worked with the angle wide of short long leg but not enough on it for any more than a couple;
3.3;4;Hazlewood to Hales, FOUR runs short of a length, pulled hard and beats deep-square leg, well timed;
3.2;W;Hazlewood to Lumb, OUT full length on off stump, Lumb tries to heave over the leg side but puts it straight up in the air and mid-on takes a solid catch. Lively from Lumb but he's totally miscued that trying to pick a ball up over the leg side;Michael Lumb c Coulter-Nile b Hazlewood 18 (14m 15b 4x4 0x6) SR: 120;
3.1;?;Hazlewood to Lumb, no run down the wicket and swings at a length ball just outside off, gets a toe-end that runs to slip in the end;
2.6;4;Starc to Hales, FOUR runs full length just outside off, Hales swings it wide of mid-on, the 39-year-old gives chase and could have done much better there, his slide is not in time;
2.5;?;Starc to Hales, no run full and some inswing into the pads, Hales misses trying to flick to leg;

2.2;?;Starc to Lumb, no run full and some swing, pushed at outside off and gets a thick inside edge to midwicket;

1.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, no run full and wide, driven at but misses;
1.5;4;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, FOUR runs little short again and Lumb powers a pull wide of mid-on, a short-arm bash from just outside off;
1.4;4;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, FOUR runs too short and wide and Lumb slaps it over point, reasonably well struck;
1.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, no run shorter length, strikes the body as Lumb looks to play to leg;
1.2;?;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, no run full length, bit of inswing onto the stumps, Lumb punches up to mid-off;
1.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Lumb, no run leg stump line and Lumb lets it hit his thigh pad, very strange;

0.2;?;Hodge to Lumb, no run length on the stumps, forward and blocked up the wicket;
0.1;1;Hodge to Hales, 1 run around the wicket, leg stump, clipped out to deep midwicket;

Out come the players, down the red carpet in fact. Gorgeous sunny evening at the G, around 60,000 in the ground too. Brad Hodge to open the bowling!! Alex Hales on strike...

7.25pm Jade Dernbach still in the England side, he keeps being given these opportunities. No surprise Briggs is out - I don't rate him at all in international cricket. But they're batting first today and we'll see if their gun players can deliver with the bat, there were too many failures in Hobart...and yet the still scored 200.

7.15pm So what about it eh? A 39-year-old returns to the Australian line up. But his record in T20 is superb and why not have a guy bang in form in the side? An outside bet for Bangladesh too perhaps?

Sakush: "Finally the selectors make a decision they should have made ages ago! Hodge has captained Barisal Burners and is top scorer in the history of the league with 756 runs and has experience of playing all over Bangladesh will help the team a lot! Although Lynn, Dunk etc have had a decent Big Bash, a big question remains whether they can cut it in Bangladesh! Hodge will be a much safer bet in Bangladesh."

Let's get to the toss...up goes the coin, Stuart Broad calls tails, it lands correctly and England will bat first. Broad is slightly relieved that the boundaries are a touch larger here. Broad's 50th T20 for England - the first player to bring up the landmark for England. One change, James Tredwell replaces Briggs.

England 1 Michael Lumb, 2 Alex Hales, 3 Luke Wright, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan, 6 Jos Buttler (wkt), 7 Ravi Bopara, 8 Tim Bresnan, 9 Stuart Broad (capt), 10 Jade Dernbach, 11 James Tredwell.

George Bailey would have batted too and he confirms the return of Brad Hodge after 2,075 days! Mitchell Starc is also back after a long time having suffered with injury.

Australia 1 Aaron Finch, 2 Cameron White, 3 Brad Hodge, 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 George Bailey (capt), 6 Chris Lynn, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Josh Hazlewood, 10 Nathan Coulter-Nile, 11 James Muirhead.

7pm Hello everyone, Alex Winter checking in for the second T20 between Australia and England from Melbourne, where the hosts are hoping to complete a sweep of all three series on this tour. It was the same old story in Hobart, different format but more Aussie dominance and now the hosts can inflict more misery on the beleagured tourists.
 Innings Start
10.50pm: That's all for today, folks. I'll leave you with Brydon's report and the ICC rankings, where Australia have swum up to midtable mediocrity and sixth, dropping England in the gunk at eighth. Join us again on Sunday in Sydney, for the final game of the tour. Sadly, the curtains were drawn on England a long while ago. G'night, all.
10.40pm: Josh Hazlewood is named Man of the Match: "Yeah, it's nice to have an opportunity with the Test team away and to make the most of it. It's been a great summer and to be a part of it at the end is brilliant."
England captain, Stuart Broad: "Give credit to Australia, they outplayed us. Maybe the wicket just stuck in a little today and we couldn't get going. We've done some great things with the bat but it's not clicked in these two games. But it's not just the batting, we didn't bowl well today. I imagine conditions in Sydney will be slightly different to Chittagong but we've have to get some momentum from somewhere."
Australia captain, George Bailey: "Another great performance with the ball, set the game up. We thought it would be a bit of a surprise for the English [to open with Hodge]. He had to make do with a catch and a run out. We've really been put through our paces in the field and in all formats it's crucial. James Muirhead bowled absolutely beautifully, he came in with confidence and did really well tonight."
10.30pm: There you have it, Australia claim another series, more silver for the mantelpiece. England have been pulverised, brutalised, marmelised again; at least they know the way to A&E by now. In 1998, England's rugby players embarked on what became known as the "Tour to Hell", losing all seven of their games against southern-hemisphere opposition by heavy margins - but England's cricketers have discovered there are still-darker corners of Hades Down Under, 11-1 down across all formats now. On a sunnier note, meanwhile, Cameron White may have sealed a spot in Australia's World T20 squad, with his second consecutive half-century, though it's a shame we didn't get to see a fellow Victorian, Brad Hodge, pressing his claim. Anyway, time for the presentations...

13.2;4;Bopara to Bailey, FOUR runs touch of width from Bopara and this is glided down to the boundary a third man, a delicate cut - and, in a blink, Bailey has fifty too;

12.5;1;Tredwell to Bailey, 1 run very full, clipped through midwicket;

11.2;?;Dernbach to Bailey, no run better length, works this one back down the track;
11.1;6;Dernbach to Bailey, SIX runs full and in the slot, creamed over long-on, almighty tap from Bailey, who's dealing in sixes himself now;

9.1;1;Bopara to White, 1 run length ball clipped down to long-on;
8.6;2;Tredwell to Bailey, 2 runs droped into extra-cover, they take on Bopara who gets there then fumbles when trying to throw and somehow the ball runs away towards long-on and they get back for a second;
8.5;6;Tredwell to Bailey, SIX runs down the ground and finding the stands over long-on with a lovely lofted drive, timed well that, Bailey trying to hit his way back into form perhaps;

5.1;W;Bresnan to Finch, OUT full delivery, Finch tries to play to leg and it hurries onto him slightly, struck on the pad and given out lbw! Seemed to strike him relatively high on the pad, but, no, knee roll and it was pretty straight too so a fair call on first look. I think Finch might have been forward, caught on the crease somewhat. But Hawk Eye has the ball going over the top so the batsman a little unlucky;Aaron Finch lbw b Bresnan 10 (21m 11b 2x4 0x6) SR: 90.9;
