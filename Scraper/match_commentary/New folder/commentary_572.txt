India have quickly subsided following the loss of Dhoni which is a shame as they were looking good for 400 for a few brief moments earlier on today. Instead, they're gone for 330, the last four wickets adding a further 33 today. Johnson looked pretty dangerous from the off today, and Clark did well when he came on for a quick flirt. RP Singh races off to prepare for bowling, and we'll be back soon to witness Chris Rogers' first delivery in Tests. Don't go anywhere.
98.2;W;Johnson to Singh, OUT Johnson wraps up the innings by flinging down a climbing delivery which rises and catches the top of RP Singh's blade, the ricochet pouched by Hussey who stands, nearly celebrates before the ball's reached him, and was never in a month of Sundays going to drop that one;RP Singh c Hussey b Johnson 0 (7m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
98.1;?;Johnson to Singh, no run Johnson misdirects a bouncer over leg, which is crouched under;
97.6;?;Clark to Sharma, no run a booming yorker on off, well dug out by Ishant;
97.5;?;Clark to Sharma, no run on off, shortish, Ishant fends into the covers;
97.4;?;Clark to Sharma, no run Ishant takes a few positive steps forward towards point, but quickly turns defensive as Clark gives him a straight bouncer;
97.3;?;Clark to Sharma, no run stands tall, defends down on the back foot just outside off;
97.2;?;Clark to Sharma, no run he survives a huge appeal first up for a strangle down leg, Gilchrist diving well to his left, but it's turned down, rightly as it turns out, as the ball brushed hip only;
97.1;W;Clark to Kumble, OUT top catch from Rogers, diving full length to his right in the covers, as Kumble, repeating his lashing efforts for the previous over, drives on the up, his shoulders pointing upwards so he wasn't over the ball, and Rogers snaps it up with a classic catch;Anil Kumble c Rogers b Clark 1 (10m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
96.6;W;Johnson to Pathan, OUT another wicket, a full delivery, a dipping low toss rapping him on the front shin in front of leg, and a smiling Johnson roars his appeal, knowing what the answer will be;Irfan Pathan lbw b Johnson 28 (73m 44b 4x4 0x6) SR: 63.63;
96.5;1;Johnson to Kumble, 1 run a drop at gully, Clark diving to his left, as Kumble lashed a back-foot cut hard down from a wideish delivery;
96.4;?;Johnson to Kumble, no run pushed a bit wider, fended away from the body on the front foot into the covers;
96.3;?;Johnson to Kumble, no run cracker from Johnson, evil movement in the air and pitches just outside off, nearly clipping the batsman's outside edge, a nervy one for Kumble;
96.2;1;Johnson to Pathan, 1 run presses forward to clip into midwicket on the front foot, the ball a regulation one on off;
96.1;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run right up there and defended forward;
83.6;?;Lee to Pathan, no run beaten, as Pathan pushes off the front foot but cannot connect;
83.5;?;Lee to Pathan, no run sharp one, nipping back off a short length, 146ks, and Pathan lunges forward then back to defend towards point;
83.4;2;Lee to Pathan, 2 runs fuller one now, swinging in, Pathan pushes wide of mid-on and wants two;
83.3;?;Lee to Pathan, no run jaffa! A cracking bouncer has him sniffing leather, but he just does well to rear his head out of the way - what a delivery at the end of the day;
83.2;?;Lee to Pathan, no run short of a length outside off stump, he gets back and shoulders arms;
83.1;2;Lee to Pathan, 2 runs ah thats tough! Lee bangs in a snorter, Pathan tries to get out of the way but bat hangs out in the air and the thick edge flies just over third slip;
82.6;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run short of a length outside off, angling away, 138ks, well left;
82.5;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run 138.6ks, back of a length, Dhoni inches forward and defends;
82.4;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run short of a length outside off, he gets across and leaves it be;
82.3;4;Johnson to Dhoni, FOUR runs there's his first boundary, reaching out to a wide one and driving past cover;
82.2;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run fuller, looking for swing, Dhoni comes forward and defends to cover;
82.1;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run oh thats close, as Dhoni opts to shoulder arms to one that narrowly misses clipping the top of off stump;
95.6;?;Clark to Kumble, no run a much less eventful ball to round off the over, defending forward in line with off;
95.5;?;Clark to Kumble, no run got him! Hasn't got him! Kumble comes on to his front foot and squirted out towards Jaques at short midwicket who dives forward but didn't catch it cleanly and immediately signals so;
95.4;W;Clark to Dhoni, OUT pitches in line with off, there's a huge, long appeal and Umpire Rauf takes his time to give that one out. Dhoni gets in a big stride forward on a bouncy pitch, the ball hits him on the knee roll, the batsman not quite bending his knee on the forward defensive;MS Dhoni lbw b Clark 19 (84m 52b 2x4 0x6) SR: 36.53;
95.3;1;Clark to Pathan, 1 run overpitches this time, at 131.7kph on off, pushed out through the covers where there's some neat work with a forward dive to take the pace off the ball, if not quite a full stop;
95.2;?;Clark to Pathan, no run lets that one go through down off, more deliberate this time, the ball again nipping off the seam away;
95.1;?;Clark to Pathan, no run start-and-a-half from Clark who licks the ball away from the left hander, movement from both the seam and in the air, too good for the batsman who's saved by the drift away;
94.6;1;Johnson to Pathan, 1 run turned well off the legs through fine leg to round off a useful over for India;
94.5;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run defended this time;
94.4;4;Johnson to Pathan, FOUR runs overcorrects with a wide one, Pathan crashes out a cut through the gully that flies in the air but Superman Hussey can't stay airborne long enough as he dives to the left;
94.3;4;Johnson to Pathan, FOUR runs strays on to middle with the attempted yorker that's in fact a half-volley, Pathan waiting for the one which angled back in to him and flicked it in front of midwicket;
94.2;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run hurried on to him down the same line, the ball jumping up and defended back down on the back foot;
94.1;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run stays over, obviously enough as he's facing a left hander, up there on off, and snuffed out defensively on the front foot;
93.6;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run done him like a kipper, or a dressed lamb, anyway the ball nipped back in from outside off, on a good length, and though he shaped to leave it, it nearly brushed the outside edge;
93.5;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run short ball, rising over off, in other words a bouncer, swayed under, reverse-limbo-style;
93.4;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run tight delivery outside off, a good length, and it's wisely left alone;
93.3;2;Lee to Dhoni, 2 runs reaches outside off to scoop the ball round through midwicket;
93.2;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run a slow, slower ball, at 113kph, the ball also dying, oddly, on its way through outside off;
93.1;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run a little bit of movement away from the right hander outside off, he jumps back and shoulders arms;
92.6;1;Johnson to Dhoni, 1 run outside off once more, Dhoni stands firm and tries to repeat a similar shot from two balls back, only straighter. He plays it a fraction late and the ball crashes off the toe of the bat into the floor and hardly goes anywhere;
92.5;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run Johnson responds well with a better-length delivery that rears up outside off, forcing Dhoni to shoulder arms once on his haunches;
92.4;4;Johnson to Dhoni, FOUR runs a stand-and-deliver shot from Dhoni, literally, he took one step, stopped and then swung his arms away from his body through the covers. Belted;
92.3;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run moved back in from the seam from outside off, cutting right back and rapping his bat above the sticks, the ball crashing back into his body;
92.2;2;Johnson to Dhoni, 2 runs half-volley on off, not quite timed, but they pick up something all the same from a front-foot push;
92.1;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run oh hello, not much daylight offered on that one, right up there on off and forcing the defensive;
91.6;?;Lee to Pathan, no run similar ball, similar result, only this time Pathan practises his on-on- knee-and-sway manoeuvre. This is also effective;
91.5;?;Lee to Pathan, no run banged in at the left hander, moving in off the seam and that was comfortably ducked under, on the knees;
91.4;?;Lee to Pathan, no run angles into the left hander now, pushed back forward on the front foot towards Lee who scoops it up;
91.3;?;Lee to Pathan, no run strained across the left hander on a good length, wide enough to leave;
91.2;?;Lee to Pathan, no run up there again, but tighter, and defended on the front foot now;
91.1;4;Lee to Pathan, FOUR runs over the wicket, overstretched with a half-volley that Pathan stands tall to meet, presenting the face of the bat and the ball races through mid-off;
90.6;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run slower delivery, 138.9kph, drops down in front of off, almost yorker length, and it's tidily defended;
90.5;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run stays over to the right hander, good length ball on off, defended forward;
90.4;3;Johnson to Pathan, 3 runs and a better shot from Pathan too, taking one from off and working out in front of midwicket. Some good running from the batsmen, there;
90.3;1;Johnson to Dhoni, 1 run but Dhoni is more confident, the ball shortish on middle, and he presses down off the hips for an easy clip-and-run;
90.2;1;Johnson to Pathan, 1 run Pathan decides enough is enough and aims to squeeze a ball on off through midwicket; he gets bat on it, but not much and that looked more a shot of desperation than anything;
90.1;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run Johnson bustles in again, all shoulders, and aims on off stump, a tight length earning him a "Well bowled" as Pathan defends;
89.6;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run guess where he bowled it? Correct, and it took some swing away, Dhoni not tempted into flashing outside off;
89.5;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run maintains a good line, the ball plinking down the channel once more, on a good length and left alone;
89.4;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run in the corridor line this time, but it's short, and the bouncer is swayed way away from, and pretty easily, too;
89.3;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run lets this one through this time, Lee continuing to plumb the channel;
89.2;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run ...and he finds the edge this time, a decent ball just outside off, pushed fuller and an edge goes down to the gully;
89.1;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run wheels a straightforward delivery down the channel, a regulation leave, but you can see what Lee is trying to do: draw the batsman into playing outside off;
88.6;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run similar kind of delivery, if tighter, and Pathan is able to defend more sturdily this time;
88.5;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run ...but not this time, a miscue outside off, playing a short one away from his body with a scold-worthily lack of footwork which nearly undoes him, but the ball goes safe in front of him;
88.4;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run pushed down the channel, and Pathan leaves it very easily;
88.3;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run slinks that one down the channel;
88.2;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run a better length, fuller, and also slightly tighter, but Pathan judges it well in leaving;
88.1;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run slung with no little muscle down the off-side, shortish, but wide and left;
87.6;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run lets that one go down the off-side, a rising one met with shouldered arms, and so lets Pathan stay on strike. You can't imagine Pathan's too chuffed about that;
87.5;1;Lee to Pathan, 1 run cheeky little nibble-and-go into the covers there, Dhoni calls him through for the single and up comes the 300;
87.4;?;Lee to Pathan, no run angled across him again, Lee staying over by the way, defended stoutly on the front foot;
87.3;?;Lee to Pathan, no run pulls the bouncer out of his metaphorical locker now, and ducked under;
87.2;?;Lee to Pathan, no run that's beaten the outside edge again, this one tighter into the stumps;
87.1;?;Lee to Pathan, no run oh hello, Pathan was tempted into the drive there and, my, he was lucky not to have got the outside edge as the ball boomed past him;
86.6;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run aggression here from Dhoni, good to see, pouncing on the touch of width on offer outside off, and driving crashingly to the covers where it's sharply stopped by the big fella AKA Stuart Clark;
86.5;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run angled across the right hander, nipping away on the seam, wide enough to leave;
86.4;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run up there and defended on the front foot, not much room to do much else;
86.3;1lb;Johnson to Pathan, 1 leg bye strays on to leg this time, enough width for a relieved Pathan to work the ball off his legs and get off strike - Johnson, bowling around the 140s, is sharp out there;
86.2;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run a crashing yorker on middle that's just dug out at the last millisecond by a hastened batsman;
86.1;?;Johnson to Pathan, no run left-armer to left hander, great ball first up, Pathan stabs forward down the line of off and squares up, squirting an outside edge tantalisingly toward the waiting slips;
85.6;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run draws him into the would-be cover drive now, but the ball bends away from the bat;
85.5;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run more away swing and again on a good length, enough width for the batsman to stride forward and then shoulder arms to allow it through;
85.4;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run a well-pitched delivery outside off, the swing beating the batsman who presses forward down the line but the ball jinks on past;
85.3;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run good length, inviting Dhoni forward, and he shapes to play the ball which pitches just outside off and nips wider, but leaves it at the last second;
85.2;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run this one makes him play, in front of off, and it's jabbed forward defensively and tightly;
85.1;?;Lee to Dhoni, no run finds some outswing first dart, the ball curving away as it nips wide and stays comparatively low, the batsman comes forward to play a defensive on the front foot, but lets the ball past him;
84.6;1;Johnson to Dhoni, 1 run outside off, a good length ball which is fended on the front foot with a straight bat into the covers;
84.5;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run hint of curve back in from outside off now on a good length, the batsman is a bit late on the defensive but manages to squeeze some bat down on it;
84.4;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run spears that way wide of the batsman here, down off, it pitches full and is left alone;
84.3;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run over the wicket, angles in towards middle and leg, a bit of in-drift raps him as the batsman lets it crash on to his pads;
84.2;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run regulation straight delivery, doesn't quite get up, in front of off and defended;
84.1;?;Johnson to Dhoni, no run bangs that one in short and as it rises the batsman stays in the line on middle, swaying his head out of the way, but not the shoulder and it raps him hard;
81.6;?;Lee to Pathan, no run short of a length, angling across Pathan, who defends to point;
81.5;4;Lee to Pathan, FOUR runs a gift, full outside leg stump and he deflects it down to fine leg to get off the mark;
81.5;1nb;Lee to Pathan, (no ball) thats a nasty lifter outside off, forcing him to sway away;
81.4;W;Lee to Laxman, OUT and there you go! Laxman, like Dravid not too long ago, plays a poor stroke, a horrific back-foot shot to a short ball from Lee, walking back in his crease and flat-batting to mid-off, where Tait leaps up in the air and takes a simple enough catch;VVS Laxman c Tait b Lee 27 (89m 56b 3x4 0x6) SR: 48.21;

78.1;?;Clarke to Laxman, no run tossed up on a length, Laxman comes forward and pushes to cover;
77.6;W;Symonds to Dravid, OUT now where did that atrocious shot come from? Symonds tosses it up well outside off and in an extraordinary mental block, with a hundred there for the taking, Dravid plays an ugly cross-batted swipe and top-edges to the man at cover, who just side-steps a touch and holds a dolly;Rahul Dravid c Ponting b Symonds 93 (278m 183b 14x4 0x6) SR: 50.81;

 Innings Start
Australia are dismissed for 212, which means India lead by 118 runs. There's exactly an hour left today, with 22 overs to be bowled when the innings starts, but it looks like Australia won't get more than 12 in, I feel.
Neither do I, thanks Jamie, it's Jenny again. Just watching a replay of the Tait dismissal, where his new pads, all in one mould it looks like, helped the ball balloon back to the bowler. I'm sure Martin Williamson has told me of similar pads from ages ago which were soon given up with for the same reason. One second, I will acquire the anecdote. He's gone AWOL, ah well, it's time for the second innings. Hang on!

 Innings Start
A fine 79 from Laxman, keeping his cool and handling crucial partnerships down the order, and helping India past a lead of 400. Key innings from Pathan, Dhoni and RP Singh assisting Laxman along the way. Clark finishes with four, Lee three, Symonds a couple, Johnson one, and Tait goes wicketless during a Test for which his inclusion was prepped for ages.
Don't go anywhere, as Australia will be out shortly. India will be pumped up, no doubt, their bowlers backed by a mountain of runs. Can India end Australia's winning streak at 16, like they did so famously in 2001?
Stick around to find out.
This is Jamie Alter, taking your leave, and its over to Jenny Thompson till stumps.

17.5;?;Clark to Dravid, no run big shout and Dravid looks momentarily troubled as he bends over his bat after the ball pitched in line with off, and moved away from leg, and would have gone on way down leg;

 Innings Start
Fantastic scenes at the WACA, as the Indians get into a raucous huddle, the national flag waving high above spirited shoulders. What a fantastic advertisement for Test cricket this match has been. India beat the favourites inside four days, one to rank as one of their most memorable overseas.
India become the first side to beat Australia in Australia for over four years, since their win in Adelaide in 2003. And the first to beat Australia in Perth for ten years.
Where to begin? Whew. Its been a gripping, emotional four days of cricket from both sides, sessions swinging one way, then the other, but not once has the quality of cricket been anything but endearing. Some great batting, some exceptional bowling, some stunners held and some gone begging. India can feel very proud of this win, coming here as underdogs and expected by many to struggle on what was labeled a fiery Perth pitch.
But as at Trent Bridge and Johannesburg, their seamers excelled and set up this victory. Not to forget the contributions from VVS Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, and a few cameos here and there. Sehwag's two wickets today, Irfan Pathan's stellar performance, coming into the side and scoring 74 runs, starting off twice at the dying stages of the day, and five wickets. RP Singh's first-innings bowling, the excellent display from young Ishant Sharma. All helped in halting Australia's quest for a record 17th consecutive win. Like India did in 2001.
The visitors have come back into the series to make it 2-1 going to Adelaide. Australia did well in bursts, and you know they'll come back hard in the fourth and final Test. They were hurt by a slow over-rate and a couple hard decisions today. There were good performances from Mitchell Johnson and Stuart Clark, especially, while Brett Lee was, as always, consistent. The team was let down by the batting, especially in the first innings. Michael Clarke played a good innings today.
Over for the post-match presentation. Ricky Ponting is disappointed but takes heart from "a terrific Test match". He blames the batting and praises India's bowling. He's a bit surprised how the pitch played. Believes there was just enough assistance but maintains his batsmen didn't step up. He backs the decision to play four pace bowlers, despite the flop that Shaun Tait was. Doesn't comment much on the events of the week leading in to this Test, but feels Matthew Hayden could come back for Adelaide.
Now its Anil Kumble, the winning captain. Praises the boys "for a brilliant effort when no one gave us a chance". Appreciates how well the team did under pressure before and during this Test, singling out the batting and the decision to bring on Sehwag today. Thanks his young bowling attack, who performed "with intensity" and controlled their swing, and is glad it was a team effort. Is confident of winning in Adelaide, and says India will go there with all the confidence.
The Man-of-the-Match is deservedly Pathan. A great comeback match for him in Australia, and he's all smiles, just glad he got a chance here. Is pleased with the way he bowled here, and is happy the runs helped. Credits hard work for his return to the side, admits he lost his way with the ball last year, and believes its all coming together well. The mental strength is key, he says, calling himself "a bowler who can bat". Good man, that Pathan.
So that brings us to the end of a fantastic Test. India achieve a back-to-the-wall victory to come back from a tough loss in Sydney.
Thanks for tuning in again and I hope you enjoyed this match as much as I did. Do join us for the fourth Test, starting in Adelaide on January 24 at 10:30 local, 00:00 GMT. On behalf of my co-commentator for the first three days, Jenny Thompson, and all of us at Cricinfo, this is Jamie Alter signing off. Goodbye for now!
