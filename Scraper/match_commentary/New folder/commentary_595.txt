1.05 pm: Bangladesh have restricted Australia to 198 for 5 on a slow pitch on which the ball has not come on to the bat. There was assistance from the spinners and the duo of Shakib and Razzak used it beautifully. Bangladesh's fielding - apart from two dropped catches - was sharp and they pulled off three run-outs to slow down Australia's top order.
Australia have batted 50 overs and scored less than 200 only 26 times. They've won 11 of those matches, says Travis Basevi. It is also only the second time a team has batted the 50 overs in the first innings and scored less than 200 and only lost five wickets.
However, the Bangladesh batsmen have been dismissed for 74 and 117 in the previous two games so they'll have to score their highest total of the series to win this one. It is most certainly their best opportunity. I'll be back at 1.45 pm for their run-chase.

9.30 am: Shaun Marsh, who made an unbeaten 69 in the previous game, and Shane Watson are opening the innings. They added 73 on Wednesday. They'll be up against Mashrafe Mortaza first up and he's bowling from over the wicket. Peter Parker and Amiesh Saheba are the umpires for the game.
"There are only a few hundred spectators in so far. Hopefully people will filter in as they start to wake up after a big Friday night in Darwin," says Brydon. "Admittedly 9.30am is a ridiculously early start time by Australian standards."
Australia's coachTim Nielsen was disappointed by the turn-out in previous games.
Toss, 9.00 am: Michael Clarke has won the toss and Australia will bat. They are fielding an unchanged XI and are wearing black armbands in memory of Col Egar, the former umpire and ACB chairman, who died on Friday.
Australia: 1 Shane Watson, 2 Shaun Marsh, 3 Michael Clarke (capt), 4 Michael Hussey, 5 David Hussey, 6 Brad Haddin (wk), 7 Cameron White, 8 James Hopes, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Nathan Bracken, 11 Stuart Clark.
This is what Brydon had to say about the pitch in his preview: The drop-in pitches in Darwin have not been the easiest surfaces to bat on, although Australia have made it look considerably simpler than Bangladesh. The players will be expecting early seam and swing and whoever bats first must work hard through the first hour.
There's a bit of time to pass before the start and you could spend it checking out Cricinfo Sportscenter and other exclusive videos on Cricinfo TV.
8.50 am: Good morning and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the final ODI between Australia and Bangladesh at the Marrara Cricket Ground, or the TIO Stadium as it is now called.
I'm George Binoy, your commentator for the day.
"It's a sunny morning, a few scattered clouds, but really a perfectly fine day," says Brydon Coverdale from Darwin. "Temperature to get up to 32 degrees, so not quite as hot as Wednesday's game." So chances of a wash-out foiling Australia's plans of a 3-0 whitewash are zip.
Bangladesh, on the other hand, will hope to put up a sterner fight today than they have done in the previous two games. They had announced their team last night. It has two changes: Mehrab Hossain jnr and Nazmul Hossain are out and in come Mahmudullah and Farhad Reza.
Bangladesh 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Junaid Siddique, 3 Mohammad Ashraful (capt), 4 Shakib Al Hasan, 5 Alok Kapali, 6 Dhiman Ghosh (wk), 7 Mahmudullah, 8 Mashrafe Mortaza, 9 Farhad Reza, 10 Abdur Razzak, 11 Shahadat Hossain.
I'll have the Australian line-up for you in a bit. Meanwhile, the A team is touring India and Simon Katich spoke to Sriram Veera about the challenges of being a dour batsman in a team full of dashers. If you like this story, you can share if with friends by clicking on the button at the bottom.
 Innings Start
4.00 pm: Well Shahadat isn't coming out to bat. He had split his webbing while fielding so that is the end of the match and the series. Australia have swept it 3-0, a result that was expected at the start of the series.
However, Bangladesh will be left to reflect on another terrible batting performance. They had a real chance of victory after their spinners - backed up by outstanding fielding - had restricted Australia to 198 for 5. They even had one batsman - Tamim Iqbal - who got stuck in. However, Tamim needed some support from someone and nothing was forthcoming. The top-order batsmen - Ashraful in particular - threw their wickets away and the middle-order collapsed after Shakib was dismissed. Tamim was eventually dismissed for 63, trying to score all the runs on his own with wickets falling steadily at the other end.
Clark provided the early wickets for Australia and Hopes struck three blows to Bangladesh's middle order.
The Man of the Match is Tamim Iqbal. He timed the ball best on this slow pitch and, while he was batting with Shakib, Bangladesh had a solid chance.
The Player of the Series is Michael Hussey who scored 150 runs in three innings and was dismissed only once. So he's done a lot for his average!
That brings Bangladesh's tour of Australia to an end. Thank you for all your emails during the course of the series. On behalf of all the commentators during the series, this is George Binoy signing off. Cheers.
