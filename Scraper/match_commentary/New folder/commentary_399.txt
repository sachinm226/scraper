Data
10pm: So Pakistan have spent four hours in the field, half an hour longer than they should have. Never easy finishing your overs on time in these conditions.
Had Pakistan taken their chances, they would have been chasing much less. 249 is surely going to test them in these conditions and Australia will feel they've put up a very competitive score. Join us at 10.25. It will be a shorter interval.
Sohail: "I think one of Wahab Riaz, Talha, Rahat Ali or Sadaff Hussain needs to be in the team instead of Sohail Tanvir. All got better pace and control than him."

Time to look at some mails.
Inamullah: "Pakistan should enter the match with a positive mindset, and an attacking approach. Specially in the batting department, sending Kamran with Nasir in for opening may be better than sending Hafeez. Kamran can be made to attack, and that will give Hafeez some breathing space too (hopefully)."
Syed: "Totally agree with Zahid. Sohail has no place in the squad! The guy's aging, has no pace, and everyone's picked his action now. Why are we including him in the squad when we've got the likes of Gul and Junaid."
We will have to wait a few hours to see if Pakistan do make any changes.
Zahid: "Sohail Tanvir has never impressed at an international level, his selection in Pakistan team is not justified. Anyone disagrees?"
Sohail: "Both captains had contrasting expectations after the first game - Clarke expects his top order to perform better whereas Misbah wants his lower order to score runs. Hopefully Pak can play pace better and spin for Aussies."
Toss: Australia have won the toss and they will bat first. Australia are unchanged. Abdur Rehman replaces the injured Afridi and Junaid Khan replaces Aizaz Cheema.
The Pakistan seamers couldn't provide any breakthroughs in the first game, unlike the Australians. Junaid is a better wicket-taker than Cheema so it might be a good decision. Pakistan will be chasing tonight so it's important their bowlers keep Australia to a similar total on Tuesday. If Pakistan lose this, they lose the series as well.
Read the preview for this game.
5.15pm: Good day everyone and welcome to the coverage of the 2nd ODI between Pakistan and Australia in Abu Dhabi. The toss is on in 15 minutes. Will the conditions be any different for the bowlers? We will wait and see. The weather won't change though.
The news we now, though, is that Shahid Afridi is not playing today due to a back injury. He sustained it while training last evening.
 Innings Start
Presentation: The endless stream of awards continue...
Nasir Jamshed is the Man of the Match: "I was cramping towards the end. The captain told me to play my natural game."
Clarke: "I should have bowled first. Good third game coming up. Difficult to hold onto the ball but no excuses. Our middle order played well but we didn't execute with the ball."
Misbah: "Much needed win. Jamshed showed maturity and class. Bowlers did a wonderful job to restrict them. In this outfield it is difficult to restrict any team under 250, lucky toss to lose."
That's it from us here. It's been a really really long night. Goes without saying really. Catch the decider in Sharjah on Monday. Thanks for your mails. Cheers!
End of match: Pakistan enhance their good chasing record at Abu Dhabi. It was Clarke who won the toss and opted to bat, but it backfired because the dew was uncontrollable for the bowlers late at night.
Having said that, a deserved victory for Pakistan. A crucial DRS reversal proved the turning point as Jamshed wisely challenged the LBW early in the innings and went on to score an entertaining 97. He should never have been given out in the first place. Azhar Ali played with a relaxed frame of mind and Pakistan never looked in danger of folding up. Stay with us for the presentation.
