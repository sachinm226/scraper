Symonds finishes unbeaten on 162 and takes the applause from the crowd. Now, a nice moment, Ishant goes up and shakes his hand to indicate no hard feelings.

Cheers Jenny. India look flat and deflated. They've been hard done by some of the umpiring decisions but what has hurt them most is their inability to control Australia's run-rate. Symonds has had a couple of let-offs but Brad Hogg hasn't been troubled at all. Singles are coming at will, the boundaries frequently enough, Australia could get 400 before stumps at this rate. 21 overs remaining in the day so we could be in for over time.

"Where are the knockers of Australia's middle order hiding now?" demands Michael. Symonds and Hogg have added 162 for the 7th wicket.
 Innings Start
5.32 pm local time Ishant's done a splendid job, scoring 23 out of the last-wicket stand of 31. Tendulkar walks off the field to loud cheers once again, he remains undefeated on 154. Could he have shielded the tail better? Well the last three wickets added 187 runs so you have to give him credit. India lead by 69 runs in the first-innings. Australia have about 30 minutes to negotiate before stumps. Matthew Hayden and Phil Jaques will run out in less than ten minutes.

 Innings Start
12.20pm Australia are walking out for the ten-minute session before lunch. There have been three minutes of the heavy roller used on the pitch.
Innings break Australia have declared to give themselves a burst before lunch, Hussey remains unbeaten on 144, which is a very well fought one indeed. So Australia set India the portentous target of 333. The draw is looking ever more likely - this would be a record chase should they attempt it, while Australia may not have left themselves enough overs. However, anything could happen and probably will so don't go anywhere.
Kumble, by the way, needs one more wicket to bring up his 600 but will have to wait until the next Test now.

 Innings Start
Three wickets for Clarke in one over have sealed a record-equalling 16 Test wins in a row for Australia in the second Test at the SCG, so they take a 2-0 lead in the series. This game has had everything - excellent batting and disciplined bowling, but will be remembered, too, for some questionable umpiring decisions.
Ponting is speaking now. "Michael Clarke's got the golden touch, hasn't he? We knew if we kept them under pressure we'd have a chance. That's an unbelievable win, almost as good as any I've been in, I think. When we declared we were the only ones who could win that today. With ten overs to go the game was sort-of slipping away but even then I knew we only needed one wicket.
"The job Andrew Symonds did for us today was amazing. We tried every option, the last roll of the dice was to give Michael Clarke a crack."
Symonds is the Man of the Match. "Pup is comfortably one of the luckiest blokes I know, it was handy to have him on our side. It was a real old-school classical Test match. It's been a big team effort."
Clarke now. "I've been asking Punter all day to have a bowl. I'm certainly taking it." He's just been asked if he thought they could win it when he came on late. "Honestly, not a chance in hell and I think that's why Punter threw me the ball. India, though, did really well to fight as they did."
Well, this has been an absolute epic of a Test. Thanks for joining us and for all of your emails - sorry we couldn't use them all but we always get thousands, literally. From me Jenny Thompson and him George Binoy it's goodbye, thanks again, and do tune in next time for the Perth Test.
