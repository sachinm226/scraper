Data
1:05pm: In case you have just tuned in, the rain has relented and West Indies have been dismissed for 330, after having achieved their highest total of the series. Lyon, who even experimented with legspin, and O'Keefe finish with three scalps apiece. Will Australia ramp up the pace after the break?
Jaco: "Warrican has not got all the whole tour, quite remarkable!" Ah, he has a higher average than Ponting, Sachin, and Lara
Jason: "A result could definitely be contrived if Smith declared and Holder declared and left Australia aiming at 330 in 50 overs. "
Simon: "I think it's safe to say that when Warner comes out he wont be playing defensively."
Schooner: "Australia should declare at 0 and send them back in. Was it Tubby Taylor that did it for NSW in a Shield game? I know it backfired that time, but it might make it a little more interesting." - Oh, did that happen? I am not aware of it. And I don't think the captains can manufacture a result here. A draw is inevitable

 Innings Start
4:50pm: Smith calls Warner and Nevill in. The players exchange handshakes. All over at the SCG. It's a draw, but Australia lift the Frank Worrell Trophy, having already sealed the series 2-0 in Melbourne.
Steve Smith collects the trophy. It's party time for the hosts. That is all we have for you. Brydon's report should be your next stop. Until next time, cheerio from all of us at ESPNcricinfo.
For Warner, it was fun and (card) games off the field over the last couple of days. Today, he had fun on the field, after rain relented, and lit up the fifth day with the fastest Test century at the SCG. He began bang, bang with successive fours (the first of which an all-run four) and hardly looked back. A mini-blast to end an otherwise frustrating rain-laden Test.
Steve Smith, the Australia captain: I think it has been a great summer. Voges summed it up well. We have scored 15 hundreds among six Tests and took 20 wickets four times. We have a great bunch of guys together. We are going to continue to get better and adapt to conditions across the world. India are a very good one-day side and it will be a tough series for us.
Jason Holder, the West Indies captain: We got better as the series went on. I thought Darreb Bravo had a decent series for us. We have to learn quickly. Most of us have not played much international cricket. We will have to adapt quicker. Captaincy is hard work but I am trying to enjoy it. Special thanks to Richie Richardson, it is his last match for us. I want to thank him for his contribution as a player as well as manager.
Adam Voges is the Player of the Series. He will receive the Richie Benaud medal from Daphne Benaud
Voges, the inaugural Richie Benaud medalist: Huge honour to be the first one to win the award. It has been an amazing 12 months. It has been great fun since Dominica and I am enjoying it. It has been a great summer and I am just glad to be part of it. I don't have a choice. I am the old man by a fair bit. Under Steve's leadership, we have gelled well. Tough to pick the best innings. I enjoyed Hobart but the hundred against NZ at Perth at home has to be my favourite.
David Warner, the Player of the Match: Not at all (did he know whether he was the fastest Test centurion at the SCG?). Smithy wanted us to be the No.1 Test nation across formats. I spoke to Rogers before, the way I worked my game against England. That has helped me to score runs this summer. It is great to have the family around. Hopefully, we can beat India on home soil. I thank the fans for your patience.
O'Keefe: 22 years ago, I walked to play some milo cricket. To get out here, I had a nice home cheer. I really enjoyed my time, it is such a prestige to wear the baggy green again. To get three wickets and bowl in tandem with Lyon, it is a cliche, it was a dream come true. I felt a bit more relaxed on the fifth day and hats off to the young lads and support lads who made me feel at home.
Hazlewood: The three middle days were disappointing. Moving forward, we are in a good position. We are a little bit fatigued. Good to get through six Tests. Adelaide was the highlight of the summer.
