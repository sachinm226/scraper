Data
Australia were 35 for 2 in 11 overs when the rain came down. They have added 181 in 21 overs after resumption. Brilliant hitting from Wade and the Hussey brothers, on top of their busy running between the wickets. India's medium-pacers, especially Vinay Kumar, were nippy upfront, but their spinners have been thrashed, with the exception of Rahul Sharma

cris: "Somebody, please help me out here..It's a dry pitch, India have 3 spinners, PK enjoys swinging the ball under the lights, their batsmen are not in great form. Why in the world would you want to bowl first? Am I the only one who finds this weird?" Fair points, cris, it only shows how much faith they have in their ability to chase. Also, as Sidharth Monga points out, rain is expected later today.
Hayden: "When Lee was ruled out of the 2007 ODI World Cup due to an ankle injury, a relatively inexperienced Shaun Tait announced himself on the international stage, and assumed Lee's mantle as the spearhead of the bowling attack. He ended up becoming the third highest wicket-taker of that tournament. It this the tournament for McKay or Starc to really make a name for themselves?"
yogi: "@harish yeah true. I think another seamer or even umesh in place of vinay would have been better especially given both praveen and vinay are not that reliable at the death. May be dhoni will look to rahul sharma for that."
Harish: "Excellent team selection from india. taking a strong stance to rotate the senior players. maybe could have played another seamer considering they are playing 3 spinners. other than that good team selection."
1.52 pm India win the toss and will have a bowl
Dhoni: "Sides here have chased really well. It is important to restrict sides. Sachin is back, we have rested Sehwag. That is the only change from the last T20 we played." So only two medium-pacers for India, they are going in with three spinners in Ashwin, Rahul Sharma and Jadeja. And Tendulkar is playing his first ODI since the World Cup final in April 2011. And India are resting one of their senior batsmen, Sehwag, so that means Rohit Sharma gets to play. Will that be their approach going forward in ODIs?
Clarke: "I was going to bat first, wicket looks very good, probably a bit drier than I thought, so it could turn a bit and we will have to be careful against their spinners." Wade and Christian make their ODI debut
1.50 pm Matthew Wade and Dan Christian were presented with their ODI caps earlier, so it looks like Peter Forrest won't be debuting today, our man Brydon Coverdale informs us.
Australia have suffered a blow before the start of the game. Brett Lee is out of the CB series and doubtful for the ODIs in the West Indies due to a broken foot. He was struck hard by a Dhoni slog in his followthrough in the second Twenty20.
1.40 pm It's a hard wicket with lots of dry grass, Ian Chappell thinks it will be good for batting, and could slow down later in the evening. There is a big wind blowing across the ground, and rain is expected later as well
The long Australian tri-series is back. Hello and welcome to our coverage of the first ODI of the tri-series involving Australia, India and Sri Lanka. India and Australia will face off at the MCG today.
 Innings Start
That's it from us for the moment for this game. Read Brydon Coverdale's match report here. This is Abhishek Purohit signing off. Join us for the second ODI of the series, between India and Sri Lanka on Wednesday, from Perth. Cheers
Clarke: "It's nice to win, great start, the guys who have been playing the Big Bash were perfectly suited to this game. We knew we only had 21 overs after the break. Wade was outstanding on debut. David Hussey continued his form, and Michael Hussey keeps getting runs in all forms of the game. His [Ricky Ponting's] body is about a 32-33 year-old's. He is catching well."
Wade is Man of the Match on ODI debut. Wade: "The boys are high after the Test series win and we want to keep that up. I am pretty familiar with the MCG, and it was good to go out there."
Dhoni: "Once they came back after the break, they went after our bowling. Our loose deliveries were too loose. That was the difference. And we did not get off to a good start in the chase. That was a crucial time after the Powerplay overs. If only we could have built the partnership (Kohli-Rohit). We have the self-belief. That comes with the youngsters."
Astonishing lack of fight from India after the rain break. They were on top for the first 10.4 overs, and then let it slip away completely, without a sniff of a fightback. All the resistance was from Australia's middle order, who drowned India's spinners in a blaze of frenetic running and power hitting. And their bowlers came out hungry for wickets, and India sank meekly. In hindsight, India had too many spinners - part-timers, specialist and spinning allrounders - and were a medium-pacer short. Loved the way Starc bowled, ran in smoothly, got bounce, got swing, and claimed the big wickets of Tendulkar and Gambhir
Adam: "How would you say that Wade's glovework has been this game?" Competent, and safe
