7.45pm: Well, the pink ball didn't do anything particularly mischievous but New Zealand still failed to make a significant mark after winning the toss. Maybe it was the occasion getting to them but losing 3 for 4 after tea (lunch) and 5 for 70 in the second session practically guaranteed a sub-par total. Their lights went out almost before the lights came on. However, let's hold the assessment until Australia have got through the rest of the evening, with 22 overs to bowl and the darkness closing in over Adelaide.
Mitchell Starc update: He has been sent to hospital for assessment, having gone off during the middle session due to his chronic ankle problem.

Spin after 10 overs, Nathan Lyon on early
 Innings Start
5.42 pm Australia have a 22-run lead, but they do not have Starc to bowl for them. New Zealand will do well to forget the poor cricket in the last 90 minutes and just get on with this game. They only trail by 22 and do not have to face Australia's best bowler. And Australia have to bat last. They still hold the edge in this game.
Hypocaust: "Couldn't have gone better for Australia since the Llong decision. Added over 100 runs since Lyon walked back to the crease and NZ will be facing the new ball as the tricky final session under lights approaches."
Rob: "Interesting its all NZ's fault that the call was missed (and yes it was missed) going flat is a bit unfair, both batsmen chanced their arms and played well, yes bad calls happen but this one has seemed quite cruel, and im not too sure why some of your commentators are so keen to jump on the umpires bandwagon here? Cant you call it for what it was, a poor call?"
Mike: "MNKhan - it was conclusive, when all you had to do was see the deflection off the bat. Too much reliance on technology, not enough looking for the edge when the hot spot views weren't adequate."

67.5;?;Boult to Starc, no run full and straight, and he's hit on the boot! Given but Starc reviews... I think this is going to miss leg stump! The ball actually hit low on the pad, as Starc shifted his right foot - the injured one - out of the way, it was a pretty decent yorker but it swung in a little too much and Hawk-Eye reckons it would have missed. Starc survives (in every sense)!;
67.4;W;Boult to Lyon, OUT got him, steered to gully! NZ get Lyon about 30 runs after they wanted him, a full delivery from Boult and finally he picks out a fielder, thick outside edge and it's safely held.

53.4;?;Santner to Lyon, no run sweeps and it's taken at slip... did he top edge it on to his shoulder? We're going to have a review, think from NZ. It was a full delivery, straightening off the surface, the ball passed over the bat and then ricocheted off Lyon's upper arm. We're seeing a faint mark on Hot Spot, which might suggest he kissed the top edge, but Real Time Snicko does not flicker in the slightest... It's very hard to tell, the camera angles are pretty inconclusive and after Llong deliberations from Nigel Llong, he decides that there is no conclusive evidence of the edge. They also want to check the lbw, for when the ball hit the arm - but, bizarrely, the replay shows Lyon playing a different shot. So that doesn't really help! But after all that, the decision stays not out;

Smith was really far outside his crease but Watling did not bother trying to stump him. He knew he had caught him. Massive wicket.;Steven Smith c ?Watling b Craig 53 (188m 114b 5x4 0x6) SR: 46.49;

32.2;?;Hazlewood to Watling, no run short of a length again, lots of bounce, Watling gets on top of it and plays the ball down on the off side. A full and straight one coming up?;

31.6;?;Lyon to Santner, no run tossed up on off sump, Santner strides forward to meet it and defends;

31.3;1;Lyon to Santner, 1 run defended on the back foot on the leg side;

30.6;?;Hazlewood to Watling, no run pitches on a good length around off and gets the ball to straighten on the right-hander, Watling is squared up and hit on the thigh as he tries to defend;
30.5;?;Hazlewood to Watling, no run a full and straight ball, Watling leans forward and drives to mid-on;
30.4;?;Hazlewood to Watling, no run that was so close to the stumps, Hazlewood pitched on a great length just outside off and nipped it in, Watling let it go on bounce;
30.3;?;Hazlewood to Watling, no run good length outside off, that was a full ball and Watling let it go;
30.2;?;Hazlewood to Watling, no run the bouncer and Watling ducks under it;
30.1;?;Hazlewood to Watling, no run short of a length outside off, decent bounce, left alone by the batsman;
29.6;?;Lyon to Santner, no run short and wide outside off, Santner should have done better than slap it to the fielder at cover on the back foot;
29.5;?;Lyon to Santner, no run defended on the back foot on the off side;
29.4;1;Lyon to Watling, 1 run played off the back foot towards square leg;
29.3;?;Lyon to Watling, no run what happened there? Inside edge on to pad and the ball lobs safely wide of slip, Watling had tried to defend on the front foot;

28.3;W;Hazlewood to Taylor, OUT lbw! that is full and plumb! After a couple of short of a length balls Hazlewood fires it in full and quick, Taylor is caught in his crease and leans across his stumps as he tries to defendd. He misses the line of the ball and is struck low on the pad. No question there.;Ross Taylor lbw b Hazlewood 32 (69m 32b 5x4 0x6) SR: 100;
28.2;?;Hazlewood to Taylor, no run the outside edge again and this one falls well short of gully because Taylor played with soft hands, he was squared up in his crease by a good length ball angling into him and straightening a touch;
28.1;2;Hazlewood to Taylor, 2 runs short of a length and on leg stump, Taylor moves back and across and turns the ball behind square;
27.6;?;Marsh to Santner, no run good length and straight, Santner gets behind the line and blocks;

27.4;1;Marsh to Taylor, 1 run Lyon moves to his left at point and dives to cut off a firm back-foot drive from Taylor;

26.4;2;Hazlewood to Santner, 2 runs Santner comes forward and tries to whip a full ball on the leg side, the leading edge falls safely over the mid-off fielder.

25.4;?;Marsh to Santner, no run gets behind the line of a good length ball and defends;
25.3;?;Marsh to Santner, no run another huge, massive appeal for lbw. Marsh thinks he's hit pad first again as Santner came forward to defend. This time it did hit bat before pad.;
25.2;W;Marsh to McCullum, OUT he's been given lbw! Will McCullum review? Was it too high? He is reviewing the decision. McCullum pushed forward to a good length ball coming into him from over the wicket. The ball hit the pad before it hit the bat. The height looks good as well. Replays indicate that is going to hit two-thirds the way up middle stump. He was beaten by the movement into him, played outside the line of the ball. Marsh is making up for Starc's absence.;Brendon McCullum lbw b Marsh 20 (32m 21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 95.23;
25.1;4;Marsh to McCullum, FOUR runs short ball on leg stump, McCullum jumps back, swivels and pulls the ball neatly down to the fine leg boundary, just helped it along really;

24.4;1;Siddle to McCullum, 1 run pushes it with soft hands towards the sub fielder at mid-on for a quick single;
24.3;4;Siddle to McCullum, FOUR runs a half-volley outside off stump, McCullum meets it on the front foot and drills the drive through cover for another boundary;
24.2;1;Siddle to Taylor, 1 run Taylor moves back and across and defends on the leg side;
24.1;1;Siddle to McCullum, 1 run tucked off the hips through square leg for a single;
23.6;?;Marsh to Taylor, no run defended back to the bowler;
23.5;3;Marsh to McCullum, 3 runs in the air, that's a tough catch for Marsh, McCullum drove it hard off the front foot and the ball was past the bowler at head height before he could even react. The fielder at mid-off fumbles again and lets the ball go through, it is once again the sub fielder, and TV commentary says it is the massage therapist. Grant Baldwin last played for Vics 2nd XI in 2008.;
23.4;?;Marsh to McCullum, no run a full one to follow the bouncer, McCullum hangs back and drives to mid-off;

23.2;?;Marsh to McCullum, no run defended back to the bowler on the front foot;

22.3;2;Siddle to McCullum, 2 runs a full ball on the pads, McCullum clips the ball down to fine leg;
22.2;?;Siddle to McCullum, no run Siddle is up in arms! He cannot believe it hasn't been given lbw. Siddle thinks it is pad first and then bat. Smith has reviewed the not-out decision. McCullum was pressing forward as he tried to defend a good length ball coming back at him from outside off. The impact on the pad was indeed before the impact on the bat. But replays show that whether the ball hit him in line with the stumps or not is an umpire's call, just outside the line off off stump. McCullum can bat on.;
22.1;?;Siddle to McCullum, no run tries to tuck the ball off the pads on the leg side but gets hit on the thigh and the balls goes towards the off;
21.6;?;Marsh to Taylor, no run straighter line and tapped back to the leg side;

20.6;?;Siddle to McCullum, no run fuller, around the line of off, gets well forward and blocks it with a straight bat;
20.5;?;Siddle to McCullum, no run seaming in, struck on thigh, I think, Siddle likes it - just like any fast bowler should - but umpire S Ravi doesn't. Australia decide not to review and Eagle Eye (I refer you to Brydon's report) says it was going over;
20.4;?;Siddle to McCullum, no run gets across, this is slightly shorter, blocked into the off side;
20.3;?;Siddle to McCullum, no run shows another length ball the full face of the bat;
20.2;?;Siddle to McCullum, no run length ball on off stump, keeping Brendon honest, defended back down the track;
20.1;3;Siddle to Taylor, 3 runs short of a length outside off, decent bounce, left alone by the batsman;
19.6;W;Marsh to Williamson, OUT got him, thin edge to the keeper, Williamson is gone! That's a huge blow to strike, Marsh landing one in the right spot and Williamson felt for it outside off, maybe left him ever so slightly and there was an audible tickle. They check the no-ball but the front foot was fine;Kane Williamson c ?Nevill b Marsh 9 (34m 24b 1x4 0x6) SR: 37.5;

18.1;?;Hazlewood to Taylor, no run pitched up, 136kph and begins to shape away as Taylor bunts it towards mid-off;
17.6;4;Marsh to Williamson, FOUR runs short ball, rocks into a textbook pull shot, rattled to the square leg fence! Twelve from the over releases the pressure a touch and brings up the NZ 50;
17.5;?;Marsh to Williamson, no run that's better, not quite full enough to make Williamson commit to the shot, nips away past the outside edge;
17.4;1;Marsh to Taylor, 1 run Marsh's line is veering back and forth, this at on the body and worked into a gap;
17.3;4;Marsh to Taylor, FOUR runs short and wide and clubbed to the fence, meaty stroke from Taylor, gave it the full ham sandwich;

16.5;1;Hazlewood to Williamson, 1 run straighter line and nudged away through backward square leg;
16.4;?;Hazlewood to Williamson, no run holy moly, another jaffa, Hazlewood is swinging like it's 1970s London, curves the ball away as Williamson begins to play outside off;
16.3;?;Hazlewood to Williamson, no run back of a length, climbing through to the keeper, Williamson stays inside the line;
16.2;1;Hazlewood to Taylor, 1 run pitched up and swinging away, Taylor slashes like Wolverine but Smith can't hold on at second slip! It was high to his left, Voges also went but it was Smith's catch, it got to him first but the ball burst through;
16.1;?;Hazlewood to Taylor, no run slightly short around the line of off, Taylor shows it the full face of the bat in defence;

15.3;?;Siddle to Williamson, no run length delivery in the corridor, close enough to make Williamson play, he angles the bat and steers to gully;

14.6;W;Hazlewood to Latham, OUT got him, Latham is suckered in too!

13.6;?;Siddle to Latham, no run straighter line, over the top of the stumps, blocked towards mid-on;
13.5;?;Siddle to Latham, no run back of a length outside off, Latham is much more comfortable than his erstwhile partner leaving those;
13.4;2b;Siddle to Latham, 2 byes goes round the wicket and spears this down the leg side, don't think Latham got a touch on it but Nevill couldn't grasp the catch anyway;

12.3;W;Hazlewood to Guptill, OUT nice and full, too juicy for Guptill to resist but he squirts an outside edge straight to gully! Australia knock the first brick out of the wall, Hazlewood getting it into an area where Guptill isn't comfortable, particularly if the ball shapes away as it did. Probably could have left it but nicely bowled, left him quite late;Martin Guptill c Marsh b Hazlewood 17 (52m 39b 2x4 0x6) SR: 43.58;
12.2;?;Hazlewood to Guptill, no run fires this one down the leg side, shuffles across and misses with a flick;

6.1;?;Hazlewood to Latham, no run a huge, roaring and prolonged appeal for lbw from Hazlewood, who finished up imploring on one knee. Was there an inside edge on that? Yes there was, he smashed it on to his front pad. Hazlewood got that to bend back into the left-hander from a full length just outside off, after angling across from over the wicket;

Likely to be the last over before dinner.
 Innings Start
9.15 pm BT: "An Adelaide Oval Test under clear (if not always blue!) skies only last 3 days? I don't think it is a resounding success, if very popular. The ball dominated too much, but perhaps it is the rebalancing from the big bats of the last 10 years. A bit less grass on the pitch, get it into day 4, let a side score 350 and we have a success. On the other hand, no balls needed replacing!"
I think batsmen's techniques need to get tighter. This pitch was not impossible to bat on - it swung and seamed but the pace and bounce were true. Survival and scoring just required a patience that is increasingly rare in modern batsmen. Was the pink ball harder to see? Was the seam - and consequently the direction in which the ball was going to move - harder to spot? We'll have to ask the batsmen that. I'm sure the details will emerge in the coming days.
Will we see another day-night Test? Sooner rather than later, I imagine. Until the next international game, that's it from the comms team at ESPNcricinfo. Cheers, and thank you for reading.
9.00pm Dardic: "What a test match. Enormous fight shown by NZ at the end there, so much respect for them as an Aussie"
Time for the presentation ...
The Player of the Match, in the first ever day-night Test, is Josh Hazlewood, for taking a career best nine wickets and ensuring that Australia did not miss the injured Starc too much.
Hazlewood: "It was obviously entertaining cricket, harder to bat at night with the ball swinging, very exciting Test, crowds were unbelievable as well. It was more enjoyable to bowl at night, especially if the ball was a bit newer, there was grass on the wicket which helped."
The Player of the Series is David Warner, for making 592 runs in three matches.
Warner: "Was quite challenging to bat, the previous two Tests were tough for the bowlers, great to play here on a wicket with a bit of grass, a bit of swing ... was quite nerve wracking towards the end, Hobart was in our mind a bit ... I think it's about backing myself and keep everything simple, if I try and defend I'll probably get out ..."
Here's Brendon McCullum ...
McCullum: "Was an outstanding game of cricket, completely contrasting to what we had seen previously in the series. The crowd supported it, and as an experiment it went off well ... You're only ever two balls away from being back in the game, so we always kept believeing, unfortunately we came up short but we can shown fighting characteristics in defeat ..."
McCullum on the Lyon review: "Unfortunately that had an impact on the game, would have loved to have a bit more runs .. but got to look at the series at a whole and Australia played well ..."
Australia's captain Steven Smith comes up before going on to receive the trophy.
Smith: "Was obviously a tight finish, great for cricket, last couple of days have been amazing, an exceptional event. It's been great, a bit different from the first two matches dominated by bat, it brought the bowlers into the game, under lights. If you got yourself in you could still score runs ... I just thought if Starc came in and hit one out of the screws that would be it ... Great to see Shaun score runs in his first game back."
And with that, Australia begin their celebrations that will undoubtedly go on late into the night. They have played really well to win this game. To dismiss New Zealand for 208 in the second innings without the services of their best bowler Mitchell Starc was where this Test was won and lost.
Here's Brydon Coverdale's report of an incredibly tense final day. There will be lots of news and analysis and video coming from Daniel Brettig and Melinda Farrel in Adelaide, so stay tuned for that.
8.45 pm The first day-night Test has been a special game. It's been tense throughout, and there's relief and elation on the faces of the Australians as they shake hands with the New Zealand players.
Siddle: "It was a bit nerve wracking out there, I didn't think I would need to bat ... to get the runs to win, a great way to finish. I was trying to hit a boundary but I couldn't get it away ... we thought we were never going to pierce the field! Credit to the boys for digging in and getting the job done ... great support all week, nice to get the job done."
Boult: "An exciting few days ... It was incredible to be honest (about the day-night Test) disappointing not to win ... would have been nice to have a few more runs but we thought 187 was defendable. Full credit to them, they played very well."
Nevill: "Unfortunately I was out (on his dismissal). I might have said some very quiet expletives, very quiet, I hope, to keep my match fee! It was a closely fought match between the two teams and I am sure it was exciting to watch."
Shaun Marsh: "It was tough work, they bowled really well throughout the day. Had to work really hard, happy to have got over the line. I worked really hard over the last few months ..."
Mitchell Marsh: "I got a bit excited, would have been really nice if Shaun and I had finished it off and not left it to anyone else, but glad we got over the line."
50.6;2;Southee to Siddle, 2 runs there it is! Siddle wins Australia the first ever day night Test by squirting the ball past the diving fielder at point. With all the fielders catching, even Starc has time to hobble the second, with a fractured foot and all. Starc was actually hopping through the second. Siddle raises his arms in grateful triumph after such a tense finish;
50.5;?;Southee to Siddle, no run the yorker! Siddle does well to dig it out. This is tense, tense stuff here. Can he bowl another dot ball? Can he take a wicket?;
50.4;?;Southee to Siddle, no run Siddle backs away and tries to slog through the off side, gets an inside edge on to the leg side;
50.3;?;Southee to Siddle, no run nudged towards midwicket, there's no chance of a quick single with Starc in the middle;
50.2;?;Southee to Siddle, no run would you believe it? Siddle nails a straight drive right out of the middle and the ball crashes into the stumps at the bowler's end. Those would have been the winning runs! Warner cannot believe it.;
50.1;?;Southee to Siddle, no run inside edge on to the pad and the ball lobs up and falls short of the fielder running in and diving from gully!! Was there an edge? no there wasn't. Sorry, getting excited.;

47.1;W;Boult to Marsh, OUT he's been caught in the slips! Would you believe it! Marsh had just got stuck in the last few overs and now he moves forward and pokes away from his body very tentatively at one that seams away from him from a good length, first slip takes the catch. He's played a superb innings though and is applauded off the Adelaide Oval.;Shaun Marsh c Taylor b Boult 49 (154m 117b 6x4 0x6) SR: 41.88;

27.4;?;Southee to Voges, no run a huge appeal for lbw again but the umpire says not out. Pad before bat? I think so. But the impact on the pad will probably be umpire's call on off stump I reckon. Voges pushed forward to defend a ball nipping back at him from a good length outside off and was beaten on the inside edge. The impact on the pad was outside off stump so that's not out. New Zealand lose a review.;
27.3;1;Southee to Marsh, 1 run Santner doesn't pick the ball up at cover! Marsh had pushed off the front foot and run, that might have been close at the bowler's end;

23.4;4;Southee to Marsh, FOUR runs top shot! Southee gives him a leg stump half-volley. Marsh leans forward and flicks the ball through midwicket for four more. Australia march on;
23.3;?;Southee to Marsh, no run Southee fires in the yorker and hits Marsh on the boot, he goes up in appeal but the umpire says not out. McCullum is not reviewing. Think that pitched outside leg, probably missing leg as well. Well replays show that ball pitched just in line and the impact on the stumps would have been umpire's call.;

5.4;?;Boult to Smith, no run pitches it up around off stump and Smith blocks it back to the bowler;
5.3;W;Boult to Burns, OUT plays around a full ball, that's out! Pretty plumb lbw and Burns doesn't even consider a review...

4.6;?;Southee to Warner, no run draws his length back a touch, defended on off stump... Respite;
4.5;?;Southee to Warner, no run full, in the slot and Warner lashes a drive, he's already setting off down the pitch when Guptill snatches it on the bounce at extra cover, elects not to throw with the batsman scrabbling to get back;

3.4;2;Boult to Warner, 2 runs pushed back down the track, Warner sets off early but there might be a chance at the other end, if Craig's throw was better...

Tim Southee will open up to David Warner
Hello again. Australia have the way to victory signposted and should get there before the lights go out tonight. Right? Well, we said at the start of the day NZ needed to at least double their score, which they pretty much did... You'd still want 20 or 30 more if you were Brendon McCullum but this could still get interesting. Couldn't it?
And will this pep talk from David Wedde spur NZ on? "Australia will likely wrap this up today. Poor cricket from the time the Lyon decision went against us. Bowled poorly when we should have had a 50-60 run lead then our top order failed exposing the middle order under lights. Both the openers got out playing poor shots rather than good bowling. Kane, Bmac and Taylor all got good balls but still played poorly. You should expect the odd decision to go against you but it is how YOU respond that shows champion quality so it is no excuse. We should have fired up but instead we sulked and you could see it in the on field attitude. There isn't much between these teams talent wise but the Aussies have way more mental strength!"
