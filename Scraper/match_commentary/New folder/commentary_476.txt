Thanks Lawrie. It's official: Australia will bat. One would expect Australia to aim for a target of around 450 which with a first innings lead of 218 equates to a second innings total of about 230. A declaration would probably be forthcoming in the second session tomorrow. But they have to get there first. And out come the Australian opening batsmen to build on that lead.
 Innings Start
A whole hearted effort in this match by Peter Siddle, with Nathan Hauritz doing well also in the 2nd innings. Ricky Ponting appears to be an obvious choice for Man of the Match. More on that in a minute or so. At the presentation, which was conducted by Mark Taylor - the Man of the series was Shane Watson, with Nathan Hauritz not very far behind. Congratulations to him and to the Australian team. Well the Aussies meet Pakistan on Friday in the start of the ODI series and of course we have the Big Bash Preliminary Final tomorrow night at the Gabba, between the Bulls and the Bushrangers.
