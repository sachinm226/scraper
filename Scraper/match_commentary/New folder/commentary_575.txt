2.1;4;Sreesanth to Gilchrist, FOUR runs banged in short and wide and cut hard through point to the ridiculously short boundary;
1.6;?;Sharma to Hayden, no run there must be a deliberate plan to bowl wide down the channel because there he goes again, once more left;
1.5;?;Sharma to Hayden, no run more of the same, and the batsman does well to leave it, too much of a good length;

0.3;4;Sreesanth to Hayden, FOUR runs once again that's on the legs, Sreesanth struggling to find his line to the left handers, and Hayden booted that one off the hips with a firm push through backward square;
0.2;1;Sreesanth to Gilchrist, 1 run on the legs once again and tucked round again but this time for a single, but Sreesanth will be encouraged by the swing he is finding;
0.1;2;Sreesanth to Gilchrist, 2 runs strayed down leg, turned round to deep fine leg with a quick tuck off the pads;

2.15pm The teams run out on a cloudless day, Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden representing Australia of course. Sreesanth has two slips and a point.
2.00pm Ponting says at the toss: "We're having a bat, mate. Beaufitul day, the wicket looks nice and dry. It will probably slow up a bit.
The boundary is a little bit short and although he would have preferred to play on the biggest size field, he's sanguine. "It's the same for both teams, we'll see how we go." Brett Lee, who has been rested, comes back in for Mitchell Johnson.
And will he hope that a few more of the batsmen can fire today. Ponting smiles, realises it's directed to him as well as others. "Let's hope so!"
Mahendra Singh Dhoni has lost yet another toss. "I think we need to change the coin. I would have liked to have batted first."
There are two changes to India's side. Munaf Patel has food poisoning and he has vomited a few times, so Sreesanth comes in. Praveen Kumar makes way for Virender Sehwag, because the latter can also offer some spin. "We thought the part-timers could have an impact."
1.55pm "The fever is rising," reports Nagraj Gollapudi from the ground. "The football final is on in the backyard, people are already gathered outside at the bars."
India, of course, are not guaranteed a final spot as of yet and their batting is also a concern. Read more in the match preview here.
It's warm by the way, a pleasant 27C and the weather looks OK so far, which is quite something for CB Series matches at the SCG this time around.
1.50pm Good afternoon everyone and it's straight into news from the SCG where Ricky Ponting has won the toss and Australia will have a bat against India.
Australia, of course, have already qualified and so will use this match mainly as batting practice, to check how their batting attack squares up following some persistent failures. Ponting, who's having a shocking series by his standards, has spoken about how he's not unduly alarmed while they're still winning and that so many batsmen's form slumps at the same time is merely coincidence.
Much talk about whether the IPL is distracting the players and while they continue to deny it is, there are some great quotes coming out of the situation. Check them out on our Quote Unquote page, one of my favourites on Cricinfo so do check it out.
Quotes from the toss and team news will hopefully follow soon.
 Innings Start
10.35pm Ponting is indeed Man of the Match. "Another good win by us," he says. "It had been coming for a while, the top order were going to get some runs. I spoke to the guys this morning about trying to get some momentum going into the finals and all the guys did that."
Thanks for joining me today, do come back for some more fun on Tuesday when Sri Lanka face off against India.
10.30pm "There were quite a few positives," reckons Dhoni. "The way we kept them to 318 was a good one." They've not made it to the finals of course. "We would like to win that game so that we can go through," he says of the next encounter on Tuesday.
10.25pm Well that's been an excellent day's cricket at the SCG. Both sides' batting at last came good and provided some full-on entertainment, with both Ponting and Gambhir posting hundreds.
Stay with me for the reaction and the Man of the Match. Ponting? While we're waiting for that, actually, in a press conference during the Chappell-Hadlee earlier this summer Ponting was miffed when, scoring runs for fun, not one of the press asked him in his post-match press conference in Adelaide. "By the way I got a hundred today, boys," he smirked, but you can bet all the questions will be for his batting tonight after he recovered his form in some style.
A smiling Lee now says "All in all in was a great day for everyone." And then that sportsman's cliche... stepping up to the plate? Nearly. "Everyone put their hand up." It's true, though.
49.1;W;Lee to Sharma, OUT the yorker zeros in on off, Sharma's too late on it and watches his stumps castle. Terrific bowling from Lee, those no-balls apart ahem, and he ends with five;Ishant Sharma b Lee 2 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50;

46.3;1;Bracken to Uthappa, 1 run slower one outside off and Uthappa caresses the ball out to the covers to bring up his fifty and the crowd loves it but Uthappa hardly takes the applause for his 43-ball effort, choosing instead to stay focussed;
46.2;4;Bracken to Uthappa, FOUR runs hey now, down the track and that is very cheeksville indeed, Uthappa turning it from outside off, round the corner and picking the gap well;
46.1;?;Bracken to Uthappa, no run outside off, the batsman moves backward trying to cut it out to point and has pushed back too far alas, Gilchrist takes the bails for fun;

45.4;1;Clark to Harbhajan, 1 run slower ball, pushed out to mid-on and they run the two, Harbhajan dives to get back in at the striker's end and he will probably be safe, meanwhile they've run one short so he only gets the single;

44.4;2;Hopes to Pathan, 2 runs outside off and that really is a booming drive over long-on which you think has gone all the way until Lee somehow paws at it and keeps it back in;

41.6;?;Hogg to Uthappa, no run an appeal for a stumping and his front foot was back in the crease, the batsman trying to play it like a left hander. Gilchrist was, sad irony, too quick with the bails there - afterwards the batsman's foot comes up;

29.1;?;Clark to Dhoni, no run outside off, down the channel, a touch short and there's a flashing play-and-miss of a cut out off the back foot;

7.6;?;Bracken to Gambhir, no run cut and a miss outside off;
7.5;4;Bracken to Gambhir, FOUR runs down the track and, oh, that could have easily deflected back onto the stumps, races towards fine leg and Gilchrist runs after it because there's nobody else there, he dives full length towards the end, football style, but can't stop that one;

5.3;?;Bracken to Gambhir, no run full and on off, tapped to point, fine bowling from Bracken here, he's not giving anything away;

4.1;?;Lee to Sehwag, no run short of a length, slightly wide, Sehwag throws the kitchen sink at it but can't make contact, the extra bounce does him in;
3.6;2;Bracken to Gambhir, 2 runs short of a length and close to his body, he cuts anyway and picks up a couple to third man;
3.5;4;Bracken to Gambhir, FOUR runs breaks the shackles, full and on off, gets his front foot forward and smacks it on the move, once he finds the gap it races away, great value for shots here in Sydney, it's such a cracking pitch this;
3.4;?;Bracken to Gambhir, no run short of a length and wide, another cut and a miss, he's having a bit of a nervy time here;
3.3;?;Bracken to Gambhir, no run cut to point, Clarke is prowling there and they don't take the single;

2.2;?;Lee to Sehwag, no run short of a length, pushes firmly to the off side on the jump, three patrolling the cover region;
2.1;4;Lee to Sehwag, FOUR runs sliding down leg again and Sehwag does the sensible thing, jumps up and uses Lee's pace to turn it down to the fine-leg fence, that was fast but Sehwag used the pace intelligently;
1.6;?;Bracken to Gambhir, no run good length ball, on middle stump, that's an accurate Bracken for you, Gambhir cramped for room and can only drop it close to his body, soft hands;
1.5;?;Bracken to Gambhir, no run full and on off, defended solidly on the front foot;
1.4;1;Bracken to Sehwag, 1 run short of a length, on the body and pulled away in front of square, Sehwag in the mood here, it seems;
