Data
6.05pm What a see-saw innings this has been, allowing plenty of innings to both teams. The openers went cheaply before Mendis and Chandimal charged some momentum into the innings. But Zampa's flight and legspin got them down to 158 for 5. Then captain Mathews and Kusal Perera came together to first rebuild and then change gears to finally give them the platform for the late surge. They were soon looking set for 300 but can you ever rule Australia out? Faulkner bagged a hat-trick and Starc took two in five balls, meaning Sri Lanka lost their last five for 27 runs. Still, 288 will be pretty difficult to chase here. Join us around 6.45 for the chase...
Samuel: "Would have been unique if all three of Faulkner's hat-trick victims had the same last name! We'll have to settle for two Pereras."
Jim: "You've got to love the age-old approach to the tail from Starc- bowl really really fast at the stumps"
Mustafa Moudi: "LBW, Catch Out & Bowled - Faulkner's Hat-Traick had all 3 different ways of dismissals..."

48.4;?;Starc to Aponso, no run outside off, not using that angle that much, big swing and a miss from Aponso;
48.3;2;Starc to Aponso, 2 runs too full outside off, looking for the yorker, Aponso steers it away, wide of point and gets two in the gap;
48.2;?;Starc to Aponso, no run 148kph! From wide of the crease, Aponso makes a lot of room, but it's too quick and he can't get any bat on that. It wasn't too far from the stumps;
48.1;W;Starc to Perera, OUT he's hit the off stump, Starc, you beauty! He bowled that one from wide of the crease with the angle, targetted the off stump with some pace and Dilruwan showed his bat on the wrong line;Dilruwan Perera b Starc 5 (6m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 125;

47.1;W;Faulkner to Angelo Mathews, OUT Faulkner strikes again, Mathews hits this one absolutely straight but long-off catches it just inside the boundary. It was full and straight, Mathews hit through the line but it lacked that extra distance and Henriques ran to his right to catch that safely;Angelo Mathews c Henriques b Faulkner 57 (100m 60b 1x4 2x6) SR: 95;
46.6;4b;Henriques to Perera, 4 byes mixes it up nicely with a slower ball that beats Thisara, it goes just over the stump, but oh dear! Wade misfields, it goes right through him and for four byes!;

46.4;2;Henriques to Perera, 2 runs on length on the off stump, the bat comes down hard and it's dispatched towards long-on. Mathews has been there for a while but he comes back in time for the second;

42.1;2;Starc to Perera, 2 runs another edge from Kusal - this one lands just wide of Smith who was running towards his right from midwicket. On middle and leg from Starc and Kusal turned the face of the bat but got the timing wrong. Bit of leading edge fell safe;
45.6;W;Faulkner to Perera, OUT loud appeal for lbw from Faulkner - both arms in the air like Akram - and the finger goes up! It was the slower one and absolutely full, hitting Kusal's boot as he tried for another reverse swat, but missed it, taking it in front of middle leg stump;Kusal Perera lbw b Faulkner 54 (65m 53b 5x4 1x6) SR: 101.88;

44.2;6;Starc to Perera, SIX runs Starc eyes the toes, Kusal makes room and his bat swing generates such power that even when he doesn't middle it, the ball goes to some planet at least. The powerful flick sent the ball to the leg side, nobody knows where but it went pretty high;

19.6;1;Head to Mendis, 1 run what's happened there? The ball angled across him from around the wicket, pitched outside off stump and then spun back in to cramp the right-hander for room. Mendis tried to cut on the back foot but got a bottom edge that bounced off Wade's pad, I think;
19.5;1;Head to Chandimal, 1 run worked on the leg side for a single;
19.4;1;Head to Mendis, 1 run Mendis raises consecutive fifties with a nudge towards square leg off the pads, he acknowledges the applause from his captain, team-mates and the crowd. He's revived this innings after SL lost two wickets in two balls;

16.3;1;Finch to Mendis, 1 run bowled full and straight, driven towards extra cover and there's a HUGE mix up between the batsmen, both of them are nearly at the striker's end. However Finch doesn't not get back to the bowler's end - he went for the ball instead - so Smith decides to go for a direct hit, and he misses. Neither batsman was in the frame, he had so much time. Australia have bungled this, and Sri Lanka are so lucky;
16.2;1;Finch to Chandimal, 1 run driven gently along the ground to pick up a single to long on;
16.1;1;Finch to Mendis, 1 run gets down on one knee and sweeps the ball from just outside off through square leg. I think SL will be more positive against Finch this over;

6.3;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run a confident appeal for caught behind form Australia, they think Chandimal has edged it but the umpire says no. It was pretty full outside off, Chandimal drove away from the body and replays show that was a good decision - ball missed the bat and the sound was of bat hitting the ground;
6.2;?;Starc to Chandimal, no run beautifully bowled outside off, hardly any room but the ball moves away just a touch, not allowing Chandimal to connect as he tried to poke without footwork;

3.2;?;Lyon to Chandimal, no run nicely tossed up around off, steered to the leg side with the turn;
3.1;W;Lyon to Dilshan, OUT bowled'im around the legs, is he? They are checking with the replays and it shows the ball touched the pad before clipping the leg stump. Lyon around the wicket, pitches it around middle and leg and gets it to turn a bit, Dilshan wanted to work it away gently with the turn but inadvertently exposed his leg stump and the ball got deflected off the thigh pad and onto the stump. "See you, pal," said one of the Australians while crossing Dilshan to congratulate Lyon;Tillakaratne Dilshan b Lyon 10 (16m 11b 2x4 0x6) SR: 90.9;
2.6;W;Starc to Gunathilaka, OUT bowled'im, through the gate! That one pitched on length outside off, and it was the cutter from Starc, it came in after pitching and Gunathilaka's gap between bat and pad was too wide for the ball to sneak through;Danushka Gunathilaka b Starc 2 (13m 8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;

0.2;1;Starc to Gunathilaka, 1 run too full around off, he pushes it into the covers and then dives at the umpire's end to make it in time. Sharp throw but it missed and looks like he was in;
0.1;?;Starc to Gunathilaka, no run lovely shape to move the ball away from the LHB. Hits a good length with pace and good bounce too;

2.29pm It's almost time and the SL openers have walked out - but it's Dilshan with Gunathlaka, not Kusal Perera. Starc has the ball, as usual. Two slips in place. Here we go...
Kearun: "Half battle won already by SL? We will find out after the first spell from Starc"
2.20pm Russel Arnold says we should expect turn on this pitch too and it may not lose the top like the first ODI's pitch.
Angelo Mathews: Now dew later on so spinners should come into play later on.
Steven Smith admits he would have opted to bat first too because of the dry pitch.
Sri Lanka are going to bat first.
Looks like Australia are expecting more turn and have made one change - Nathan Lyon comes in for Josh Hazlewood.
Sri Lanka, meanwhile, make two changes - Seekkuge Prasanna and Danushka Gunathilaka in for Lakshan Sandakan and Milinda Siriwardana.
Abdul Waheed: "SL should score at least 250+ and then work on fielding and spinners"
Ishan: "#TeamPerera"
KL Kusal: "Left arm leg spinner (chinaman) out and right arm leg spinner in, how this change going to be work, wait to see how it work"
KL: "@Usama: In India, we have a domestic test going and a new T20 leage too! Excited! *Greetings my sweet neighbour and our epic rival* - Congrats on Test No.1, well deserved!"
Our man AFF is at the ground and says it's cloudy overhead at Khettarama. A small crowd in, mainly on the terraces. And the pitch looks a little less dry than the Sunday one...
1.50pm Nuwan Pradeep, who missed the last two Tests against Australia, has now been ruled out of the ODIs too. The hamstring strain is not leaving him. Goodbyes are tough. And middle-order batsman Angelo Perera has been called up in his place.
KL Kusal: "Is Chandimal and Kusal Mendis fit for today's match??" Yes, both should be fit
Usama: "SL vs Aus and then Pak vs Eng, what a day of cricket. Go SL !! *Greeting from Pakistan*"
1.40pm After a one-sided Test series, Australia and Sri Lanka had a kind of role reversal in the first ODI. It was a turning pitch, but Australia's pacers hogged the headlines - Mitchell Starc and James Faulkner. Will the role reversal continue? Hello and welcome to our coverage of the second ODI, also at the R Premadasa Stadium, I'm Vishal Dikshit and will entertain you, along with George Binoy, till I'm alive the match ends...
Sri Lanka, who have lost their last four ODIs, have to come from behind now. And Australia, having proven they are the best team in the world on high-scoring tracks, don't appear too out of place in low-scoring conditions. Read more of Andrew Fidel Fernando's preview here as we wait for the toss.
 Innings Start
Time for the presentation:
Angelo Mathews, also the Man of the Match: Chandimal and Kusal batted brilliantly upfront, to set the platform. It wasn't the easiest wicket to bat on so I batted till the 46th over. It was a good cricketing wicket, even though it spun. We needed that win and Aponso was brilliant, amazing and he bowled with a lot of effort. We've seen the likes of Kusal Mendis, de Silva and they are young and can go a long way.
Steven Smith: We didn't excite well enough with the ball or in the field today. Credit to SL for batting well and I thought 250 was par and they crossed it easily. Aponso bowls well, quite similar to Herath, some skid on and some turn. Some of our batsmen got starts?There's always pressure playing away from home and some of the guys have adapted and hopefully we can improve. Faulkner bowled nice today, the damage was already done when he took the hat-trick.
That's all from the second ODI in Colombo. do join us again for the third ODI on August 28, in Dambulla. For today you can still enjoy the ODI at The Rose Bowl where Pakistan have set England 261 to chase. Until next time, goodbye and good luck from Vishal and George.
9.52pm That's a collective performance from SL to make it 1-1. The first innings saw a lot of momentum shifts with three fifties and three wickets for each of Starc, Faulkner (hat-trick) and Zampa. In Australia's chase, SL made sure they got the more dangerous batsmen out of the way early before Mathew Wade's career-best 76. But the asking rate kept creeping up and the SL spinners did the rest. Four wickets for Aponso in only his second ODI after Thisara Perera had done the early damage. An 82-run win for SL and the series is level.
Chris: "I really think Aponso could Herath's replacement long term at test level watching the way he has bowled in this match and with his first-class figures as well."
Russell: "How is that the Aussies haven't hit 1 SIX in this match? Most of these players have T20 experience so why haven't they applied it here when urgently needed?"
47.2;W;Aponso to Faulkner, OUT flighted again, this time Faulkner is hit on the pad in front of leg stump, SL appeal and the finger has gone up. But Faulkner reviews it.

24.4;?;Aponso to Henriques, no run lbw! The good old sucker punch that was. But Henriques has asked for a review. The previous ball pitched in a similar area and turned away to beat the bat, this one pitched aroud off and slid on with the arm into the right-hander.
