Well, that was quite a turnaround. Hussey and Haddin had put on 43 quick runs, and Australia seemed headed potentially for 250, before Malinga intervened. His staggeringly accurate yorkers/full tosses proved far too good for the Australian tail. Here's the full list of one-day hat-tricks.
On the plus side for Australia, there were decent knocks from Watson and Clarke early on, before David Hussey got some much-needed runs.
Geeman has trawled through the ODI hat-tricks list to come up with this: "With that hat-trick, Malinga becomes the highest hat-trick taker in ODI's, Vaas, Wasim Akram and S MUshtaq has 2 each. Slinga is the Killa!! "
Rach: "No one could have batted with an over like that from Malinga. I'd like to say the last 5 wickets for 1 run wasn't our fault but that's just the shocked and somewhat maddened Aussie in me. Maybe Johnson should lower his arm and bowl full tosses. It seems to work!"
Jason sends in one of the more polite mails about Haddin: "Irresponsible from Haddin. Surely the order was to survive the overs, not go for a slog."
James: "Is it just me or is Malinga getting a hattrick much less exciting than watching him getting it the first time? It's almost expected against the lower order. May just be because I'm Australian."
Sam asks: "If Clarke wins and goes 6-1 for his full time ODI captaincy career, will the critics say it is due to good captaincy or as they did throughout Pontings time as captain, put it down as having a good team, or weak opposition?"
Okay, I'm off to grab a bite. I'll be back at around 6.40pm. You could entertain yourself by watching this Brett Lee interview. Or you could hop over here to see whether India can prevent a whitewash.

45.6;?;Malinga to Pattinson, no run full and strikes Pattinson low on the pads, going down leg but that doesn't prevent Malinga from belting out an appeal, a triple-wicket maiden in the Powerplay, well done Malinga;
45.5;?;Malinga to Pattinson, no run no he can't, it's full and well outside off, squeezed out towards the off side;
45.4;W;Malinga to Doherty, OUT hat-trick for Malinga, another of those laser-guided low full tosses, Xavier Doherty has no chance, the middle stump is rattled, and Australia are down to 211 for 9, so much for the Powerplay, that's Malinga's third hat-trick in one-dayers, the most anyone has ever taken;Xavier Doherty b Malinga 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
45.3;W;Malinga to Hastings, OUT Malinga is on a hat-trick now, or is Australia going to review this lbw? They have reviewed it. It was a low full toss, swinging dangerously in, the new batsman John Hastings couldn't keep it out, thuds into his pads, struck in front of legstump, umpire upholds the appeal, was it going down? the replay shows it would have taken the outside of leg stump, have to stick with the umpire's call for that, which means Hastings is gone for a golden duck;John Hastings lbw b Malinga 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
45.2;W;Malinga to Johnson, OUT Malinga you beauty, that spot-on yorker is far too good for Johnson, who was striving to get his bat down and keep that out but the ball zips past the batsman's defence and crashes into the bottom of legstump;Mitchell Johnson b Malinga 1 (3m 4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;

 Innings Start
I'd normally be required to do a short summary of the series here, but Dan B has done my job. Read his thoughts on the one-day series here.
We're set for the presentation ceremony.
Mahela Jayawardene gets an award first for completing 350 ODIs.
The Man of the Match is Lasith Malinga. Three of the previous seven one-day tricks are by Malinga.
Tillakaratne Dilshan: " Definitely, we have performed well today. The bowlers put in a fantastic effort. Today the middle order did the job for us. Chamara Silva batted really nice and his partnership with Jayawardene set up the win. Last Test series we really did well in England, and are looking forward to doing well in a couple of weeks time."
Michael Clarke is the Man of the Series: "Stoked to win the series, disappointing how today went but there is still a long way to go in this series. John came back really well towards the end of his spell, Patto started really well. We want to win every game we play, we have got some work to do in preparation for the Tests, the test guys have been here for a week and working hard."
A beaming Clarke collects the series trophy, and the Australian team gathers round it for photos. So Australia take the series 3-2, the Tests start on August 31st. See you then.
