So that single takes Australia to 203, an effort that came down to a handy partnership from Clarke and Hogg. Its been India's day so far, led once again by their seam bowlers. Ishant again caused early tremors and Pathan showed how crafty he can be in one-day cricket, reverse-swinging it to take 4 for 41. Clarke played a disciplined innings of 79 but it was again a disappointing effort from Australia's batsmen. We will have a short break, so stick around for India's reply.

Hello and Namaste to all of you who've turned up and tuned in, this is Jamie Alter, your commentator for the day, along with Raghav who will score the game, and you're reading game seven of the 2007-08 CB Series.
Its a hot Sunday, let me tell you. We're halfway through the tournament - in its final installment, by the way - and Australia lead the points tally with 12, followed by India, on 8. The pre-match news has been that Australia decided to rest Brett Lee, drafted in David Hussey as cover for Michael Clarke, and that Virender Sehwag is a doubtful starter today. Ricky Ponting's form would also worry the Australians.
India can take inspiration from their last game against Australia, at the MCG, where their pace bowlers seamed the ball around to cause plenty of trouble. That said, the Adelaide Oval is among the flatter surfaces in the country. So there should be plenty in it for the batsmen.
Despite Lee's absence, Australia have well-rounded bowling attack. Nathan Bracken is the leading wicket-taker in the series and Mitchell Johnson bowled brilliantly on Friday at the WACA. Stuart Clark's addition adds another swing quotient.
Toss: Ponting has won and unsurprisingly, decided to have a bat. Clarke passed a fitness test and will play. So no debut for David Hussey. India have made one change, bringing in Munaf Patel for Sehwag out with a side strain, so that means five bowlers. Munaf last played an ODI on August 27, 2007 in Birmingham. Mahendra Singh Dhoni spoke earlier about rotating his fast bowlers and this is a good test for Munaf.
Speaking of fast bowlers, I just heard that Tony Greig, on Channel 9, said it smacks of arrogance to rest Lee against India. Make your own calls on that.
"Its bloody hot," says Nagraj Gollapudi, our man at the ground. That equates to 35?C, clear, and 13% humidity. The crowd is walking in steadily, perhaps still busy with their Sunday brunch, so no buzz yet.
The pitch looks good for batting, but the little tinge of green suggests something in it for the bowlers. Expect a good total.

"Aaaah, it's nice and cool here," says Jenny, "in the air-conditioned press box. It's 38C today and local tennis and cricket has been called off."
Here come the umpires, so play is about to get started. Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden walk out. Huge roars, standing ovations and flag-waving agogo. Sreesanth has the new ball. Two slips, deep backward point, point, cover, mid-off, mid-on, square, long leg.
 Innings Start
So Australia beat India by 50 runs, pocketing a bonus point as well. India did so well to keep the hosts to 203 but their batting just didn't click. Mitchell Johnson was the pick of the lot, with 3 for 42, but he was well supported by Hopes, Bracken and Hogg.
Michael Clarke's sensible 79 was the backbone of Australia's total. India's seam bowlers were excellent again, with Ishant Sharma starting the slide and Pathan reverse-swinging the ball well to bag 4 for 41. It all came up futile as India's batsmen failed to back their bowlers. Australia stay at the top of the points table.
India versus Sri Lanka, at Adelaide on February 19 (13:45 local, 03:15 GMT), now becomes a tighter contest.
Over to the post-match presentation: Dhoni is disappointed about the way his side approached their chase of a small target. Says its a learning process for the youngsters. Doesn't think Yuvraj's useless shot was the turning point. Is still a bit annoyed at the call that ran himself out.
Ponting isn't impressed with his team's batting but thanks his bowlers for turning in a sharp night. He's happy to take the bonus point. Knew that if he got early wickets he had a chance, because India were a batsman short. Credits Hopes for his two wickets. Ponting looks forward to a three-day rest before Australia travel to Melbourne.
The Man-of-the-Match award is handed over to Clarke for his half-century.
Thats all we have for you tonight. Do join us for game eight. Until then, cheers!
