Data
Not for the first time have Australia done this in the recent past. A confident Ponting has declared at 459 for 5, giving New Zealand plenty of overs to face on the second day where he will back his bowlers to make inroads. North remains unbeaten on 112, following up on a stellar innings from Clarke. The conditions are very much in favour of the batsmen, but how will the New Zealand top order cope? Join us in a bit

New Zealand will be devastated as they have shown no back bone on the third day and have been cleaned up by a very clinical display from an amped up Australian pace attack that looks focused and energetic. That is 12.1 overs bowled this morning for 49 runs and 6 wickets. The highlights package is not a pretty sight for the New Zealanders. Ricky Ponting has enforced the follow on and we will see MacIntosh and Watling back at the crease in a few moments time
59.1;W;Johnson to Southee, OUT length ball and Southee who has no faith in Martin as he swings to mid wicket, big noise as the ball passes the bat. The Australians are confident and Southee is given out but he refers the decision instantly. Clearly a noise as the ball passes the bat but nothing from hot spot. The replay suggests there is no contact with the bat but no concrete evidence to reverse the decision. Unlucky for Southee but great news for this Australian side who has come out this morning and done the business with some good aggressive bowling;Tim Southee c ?Haddin b Johnson 5 (18m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 55.55;
58.6;?;Bollinger to Martin, no run fuller length outside the off stump has Martin wafting at the ball but cannot connect;

58.5;1nb;Bollinger to Martin, (no ball) Bollinger is steaming in and beats the bat of Martin who looks to defend a back of a length ball;
58.4;W;Bollinger to Arnel, OUT first ball batting in test cricket for Arnell, back of a length from Bollinger angling across the right hander and Arnell gets a feather on the ball to the safe hands of Ponting at second slip who takes a good catch leaning forward;Brent Arnel c Ponting b Bollinger 0 (4m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
58.4;2nb;Bollinger to Southee, (no ball) 1 run length ball defended into the off side with soft hands from Southee for a sharp single;
58.3;W;Bollinger to Tuffey, OUT length ball outside the off stump, Tuffey defends with soft hands into the cover regions, looks like a safe single but great work from Hauritz at point who picks up and throws with one hand and hits the stumps. Not a huge appeal but referred and Tuffey hasn't grounded his bat and inches short;Daryl Tuffey run out (Hauritz) 0 (14m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
58.2;?;Bollinger to Tuffey, no run aggressive short ball from Bollinger has Tuffey on his toes defending with half a bat to the gully;
58.1;?;Bollinger to Tuffey, no run back of a length ball angling across Tuffey is left alone wisely through to Haddin;
57.6;?;Harris to Southee, no run handsome drive from Southee off the front foot but cannot beat mid-off;
57.5;?;Harris to Southee, no run shorter length outside the off stump has Southee swaying out of the way;

57.1;?;Harris to Tuffey, no run length ball outside the off stump has Tuffey defending away from his body off the front foot into the off side;
56.6;?;Bollinger to Southee, no run fuller length angling across the right hander, Southee looks to drive and gets a thick outside edge that falls short of Hussey in the gully;
56.6;1nb;Bollinger to Southee, (no ball) length ball wide of the off stump has Southee drawn into the shot but beaten outside the off stump off the back foot;
56.5;?;Bollinger to Southee, no run shorter length has Southee defending off the back foot to cover;
56.4;?;Bollinger to Southee, no run short length again angling across Southee who drops the hands and leaves the ball alone;
56.3;W;Bollinger to Guptill, OUT a rising delivery back of a length from Bollinger, Guptill looks tentative outside the off stump as he looks to defend but gets a feather of an edge and Haddin does the rest to his right. Good aggression from Bollinger who is straight into his work;Martin Guptill c ?Haddin b Bollinger 30 (155m 122b 3x4 1x6) SR: 24.59;

55.1;?;Harris to McCullum, no run full length on the off stump has McCullum defending positively to mid-on;
54.6;?;Bollinger to Guptill, no run tighter line on a good length and once again Guptill leaves the ball alone;
54.5;?;Bollinger to Guptill, no run full length outside the off stump, too wide to draw the shot from Guptill;
54.4;1;Bollinger to McCullum, 1 run back of a length outside the off stump forced into the vacant covers for a quick single off the back foot;
54.3;?;Bollinger to McCullum, no run wide of the off stump left alone;
54.2;1;Bollinger to Guptill, 1 run shortish again and defended into the leg side, quick single taken as there is some hesitation but safe in the end to square leg;
54.1;1;Bollinger to McCullum, 1 run back of a length on the line of the leg stump neatly tucked down to fine leg;

Bollinger steams in but pulls out of the delivery at the last minute
 Innings Start
A much better performance from the New Zealand batsmen second time around as they leave Australia 106 to win the test in two and a half sessions. The Australian bowlers will be thankful they were able to wrap up the innings swiftly this morning as they are into the fourth day in the field. The New Zealand team would have hoped for more this morning as they once again showed the fragility of their 9, 10 and 11
134.5;W;Johnson to Martin, OUT full and straight and too good for Martin who looks to defend but finds only air as the ball crashes into middle stump to bring the New Zealand innings to a close;Chris Martin b Johnson 1 (12m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 20;
134.4;1;Johnson to Tuffey, 1 run back of a length well wide of the off stump has Tuffey guiding the ball down to third man;
134.3;1;Johnson to Martin, 1 run angling into middle stump and Martin gets a thick inside edge to fine leg to get off the mark;
134.2;1;Johnson to Tuffey, 1 run full and slightly wider has Tuffey this time pushing the ball into the covers and looking for two but only one available;

131.6;W;Harris to Arnel, OUT full and straight and Arnel looks to hit the ball off the front foot through mid wicket but cannot get any bat on it. The umpire has no hesitation in saying that is out as the ball crashes into the front pad. Tuffey suggests Arnell refer that but the signs are not good as the ball would have clipped the bails in front of middle and leg to confirm the umpires decision;Brent Arnel lbw b Harris 3 (13m 11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 27.27;
131.5;?;Harris to Arnel, no run well wide of the off stump and no interest from Arnel las the ball hits a foot mark and bounces a second time through to Haddin;

130.1;?;Bollinger to Arnel, no run full and wide angling across Arnel who shows no interest in playing a shot;

We have a change of bowler from the city end, Mitchell Johnson has the ball in hand

Well, Australia will be very happy with a complete performance in this first test match. A magnificant century from Clarke in the first innings, which won his the man of the match award, with great support from North who also made a century under pressure really set up the game. The New Zealanders showed a lack of application in their first innings as Doug Bollinger bowled brilliantly to ensure the follow on was enforced. The second innings from the New Zealand batsman was a huge improvement with a fine century to McCullum and good support from McIntosh, Vettori and Tuffey. But, it was never going to be enough as the Australian openers made short work of the small fourth innings target of 106 to win the game by lunch on day 5. To add to the disppointment, Tuffey has broken his hand whilst batting and will be out for a number of weeks. From Wellington, this is Simon Allen signing off, thanks for joining us here at Cricinfo and we look forward to your company in Hamilton on Saturday for the second test.
