Data
End of an incredible innings from England! 10 wickets gone and all out on the first day, but they have scored 407!
There will be a short break for the change of innings
We will be back soon with the action from Australia's reply
Till then this is Anand Vasu signing off, inviting comments and feedback at http://www.cricinfo.com/commentary.html
The players are back on the field
Light is fading fast and there is a bit of a drizzle as well
And just as they come out the rain gets hard enough for the umpires to call the covers on
The players all troop back into the pavilion
And we have news from Edgbaston and it is that play has been abandoned for the day
It was a great day's cricket and we thoroughly enjoyed bringing it to you. We hope you enjoyed our coverage.
This is Anand Vasu, your commentator, signing off, saying good night, see you at the start of play tomorrow
Do remember to write in with all your comments at http://www.cricinfo.com/commentary.html

 Innings Start
This incredible Test match comes to an end with England winning by two runs
End of one of the great Test matches of all time
England played magnificently and Australia responded in fine style, taking the game further than anyone would have imagined
This has been some Test match. Unbelievable scenes right down to the last ball.
This is Anand Vasu, yourr commentator, inviting you to write in with all your comments http://www.cricinfo.com/commentary.html
We'll be back shortly with comments from the captains
'Full credit to England, they played brilliantly. Full credit also to shane Warne for 10 wickets and his runs. Kasprowicz and Lee showed great character. We gave ourselves a glimmer of hope this morning' says Ricky Ponting
'You always miss someone of Glenn McGrath's skill and experience. But Kasprowicz bowled well and perhaps this afternoon he did more with the bat than Glenn could have' adds Ponting
'Full credit to the way Australia came out this morning. Warne and Lee have had great games. We fought hard under pressure all match. We've won this one and it sets us up for this series.' says Vaughan
'We go to Old Trafford now with momentum. We've got the series back on track.' he adds
'Freddie Flintoff was outstanding for us,' says Vaughan and it is no surprise that the Man of the Match is Andrew Flintoff
'We knew they had good players. Brett Lee was outstanding. He bowled his heart out and then batted brilliantly today' says Flintoff
'The whole Test match has been a great spectacle. Pleased that we got over the line in the end.' adds Flintoff
'We've got to believe we can go on and win the Ashes' says Flintoff
England's hero Andrew Flintoff waves his magnum of champagne at the crowd who roar appreciatively.
With that we come to the end of our coverage of this great Test match
There's been a few close games and a few classices we've shared, but this must rate right up there with the best of them
This is Anand Vasu, your commentator, telling you it was a privilige to bring you this game. I do hope you will be with us again when the first ball of the third Test is bowled in Old Trafford on Thursday
Till then, it's good bye from us all! Do write in and have your say at http://www.cricinfo.com/commentary.html
