Data
Unbelievably good batting from MS Dhoni, but India fans have come to expect it almost as a norm in ODIs. Mitchell Johnson seemed to have India on the ropes early on, but Kohli and Dhoni stabilised the innings, before Dhoni absolutely took apart the bowling in the final few overs.
The praise is pouring in for Dhoni.
David: "That dropped catch cost 33 runs off the bat! What a huge difference there is between chasing 270-280 and 300+"
mudhabir: "Whenever Dhoni plays a great knock, I convince myself that there are a lot of better players than him,but today I give up.Though this guy doesn't have the classic range of shots, he is a cut above than the rest in terms of confidence and self ability. The main thing is that he keeps it simple all the time and doesn't try too much whatever he does."
Tom: "Surely Australia can come up with a better plan than bowling full to Dhoni every ball? I understand it's very different bowling on lifeless Indian pitches, but really, a bit of variation please.."
paragordius: "At work. In the hospital. Post call after working 14 hours. But totally worth it. What a man, what a player. I thought 250-260 would be a good score to get but getting past 300 is unbelievable!!!"
priyank: "Ironical. In the post match presentation of the last game, Dhoni stressed so much on batsman not losing shape when going for big shots. & Dhoni with and in all sorts of shapes produces such big shots so successfully. Cant even define what form of a shape it is."
Karthik: "Hey This is the highest score by an Indian captain against Australia beating the 124 by MSD himself in 2008."
Hamid Ali: "Even as a Pakistani fan, I have to accept that Dhoni is the best captain of all times. Probably even better than Steve Waugh and Imran Khan. His tactics are matched by none other. He has always been short of one bowler and yet produces results. And then his match winning abilities with the bat, add to his charm. Truly an amazing cricketer."
Riyaz: "Andy Zaltzman (once wrote) Dhoni grabs ODIs by the scruff of their necks and barks at them until they call him sir! So apt!"
Uwaisul Karnain: "If a team doesn't reach 300 it's not an Indian pitch. Having said that what a magnificent recovery by the India to reach 303/9 from 154/6 led by one of the coolest men on the planet - MSD. But has he done enough to over come their ordinary bowling lineup & the dew factor?"
Steve: "Worst last few overs of bowling I have ever seen. Why continue to bowl it in exactly the same spot you've been spanked for six on the previous ball? Again and again?! Focus group bowling at its worst."
Right, I don't know about Dhoni, but I certainly need a few minutes to get my breath back. See you all again at 5.45pm.

 Innings Start
Doubly impressive from Faulkner as he was taken apart in the final over by Dhoni, he's turned it around with the bat though, and how?
Poor Ishant is getting a barrage of unprintable mails. Even some calls for Agarkar to un-retire.
Adam Voges: "we just thought if we could have some batsmen in at the end, we could chase it down, the way Faulkner played was amazing.. Haddin took a lot of pressure off me especially after the mix-up with Maxi. Faulkner said at the start of the Ishant over, 'this is it, I am going after this.' It was disappointing in Jaipur the other night, to bounce back and play some amazing cricket. It was nice to play a few balls, our top order has done such a good job, I hadn't got much of a chance."
Anyone else feeling sorry for Dhoni. First a masterclass to save the side after most of the other batsmen muck it up, then to see the target chased down in this manner.
Kuldeep: "Not gonna make too many friends there Siddarth, calling him 'Poor Ishant'!!!"
Bharath: "What makes the game of cricket really interesting is, the game is not over until the opposition thinks so and gives up.. Though an Indian fan, feeling a bit happy, seeing how sensational Faulkner turned things around (Ofcourse, wouldn't have been possible without help from Ishanth ;) )"
Shashi Tharoor, Indian minister of state who has previously written on cricket, tweets: "Questions for MSD: Why was Kohli given an over when regular bowlers had enough2spare? Why Ishant? Vinay for 48th over when VK had 2 left?"
Vishal Sipani: "Time for I Sharma to make way for M Sharma."
Post-match presentation:
MS Dhoni: "I think the last few overs were disappointing, it is an area of concern and it is getting worse. There was a bit of dew but not like in the last game, the individuals will have to step up, you have to back your strength. you don't need to spoonfeed bowlers at the international level. I think we could have batted better, on a track like this we were fortunate to get beyond 300, looked like we would get around 250. We started well, Jadeja bowled really well in the middle overs, we need more from the part-timers." Got to admire Dhoni for his temperament here, even after this gutting loss he remains level-headed, and makes some good points.
George Bailey: "Faulkner's hitting was as good as I have seen. If I could learn to catch, we would have been chasing 20-30 less from MS. The bowling was fantastic, particularly after the other day. 300 is always imposing, but we were quietly confident when we came off the field. There is no easy game."
Man of the Match, to no one's surprise, is James Faulkner: "I didn't fell I could get Ashwin to the long boundary with his carrom ball, I wanted to knock him around for 7 or 8. I made a pretty slow start, so I need to do something. I think Voges found it quite tough early on, but he stuck around all the way through, it was a good innings. It is going to be a cracking series now."
Phani Mudigonda: "Well, when MSD gave the ball to Ishant for the finals of champions trophy, it clicked..it did not today...gamble doesn't always work :("
Karthick: "Who said only MSD can change the course of game in single over! Our beloved Ishant has the capability too!!!"
Oh boy, what a finish that was. India's death over bowling was always a concern, but Faulkner's 64 off 29 has exposed it totally. For years, the mention of Ishant also had people thinking of that Perth spell to Ponting, I think his over to Faulkner is going to reach (dis)similarly legendary status.
Thanks everyone for all the mails through the day. Abhishek Purohit is frantically trying to capture all that happened in the game in his match report. I'll see you all in the fourth ODI - spend the interim pondering what changes India should/will make to their bowling. G'night.
49.3;6;Vinay to Faulkner, SIX runs a full toss from vinay on legstump, Faulkner doesn't care about the three men in the deep, backs himself to clear them and he does, a massive hit to finish off the game, Faulkner savours the moment, what an innings from him, brought Australia back from the dead, that was frankly an awful ball from Vinay, Voges also has a huge smile on his face, and why not? plenty of people were complaining about how slowly he was going in the middle overs, hardly any one will talk about that now;
49.2;2;Vinay to Faulkner, 2 runs full ball is whipped towards wide long-on, Jadeja has to race across to his right , exceptional effort there from Jadeja to save two runs;

47.6;6;Sharma to Faulkner, SIX runs SIX MORE, what on earth? Ishant Sharma had his critics before this game, there aren't going to be many people backing him after this, short once more, another pull, right off the middle off the bat, and that sails into the crowd once more, corwd not sure whether to be gobsmacked by this hitting from Faulkner or be thrilled by this sensational turnaround, that's Fauljner's 50 as well;
47.5;6;Sharma to Faulkner, SIX runs another six, this game has turned on its head in five deliveries, fans are stunned into silence as Faulkner reels off another six, another short ball and that is hooked behind square leg for another six;

47.2;6;Sharma to Faulkner, SIX runs what an amazing hit that is, this was short from Ishant, sat up for Faulkner, who clobbers that to cow corner, he enjoyed that shot, it went a long way beyond the rope, 10 off the first two balls, what will Ishant serve up now? first he has to get the ball back, it went into the crowd and hasn't been returned since;
47.1;4;Sharma to Faulkner, FOUR runs full and wide, Faulkner throws the bat at that and connects well, that soars over extra cover for four, the first ball is hit for a boundary and the 50 partnership comes up;

46.5;1lb;Ashwin to Faulkner, 1 leg bye again off the pads as the batsman shuffles around in the crease, the legstump line from Ashwin from round the wicket isn't making it easy for Australia;

46.3;4;Ashwin to Voges, FOUR runs short of length and that is powerfully swept to the square leg boundary for four, it was the carrom ball once more, too short from Ashwin;

44.6;1;Ashwin to Faulkner, 1 run defended towards point for a single;
