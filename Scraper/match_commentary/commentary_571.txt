Kumble walks off the field after a fantastic effort, he was the last man out for 87 and added 58 for the last wicket with Ishant. India are all out for 526, a massive first-innings total. Australia will be relieved to get off the field, they dropped as many as six catches in the innings.
Matthew Hayden and Phil Jaques will be out wearing the pads in ten minutes, I'll be back in a jiffy (ten minutes!) for the Australian innings.

 Innings Start
5.11 pm local time: Australia have been dismissed for 563 and lead India by 37 runs. It's safe to say that Australia cannot lose this game and the only team that could lose is India. However, a draw is the most likely result, unless India collapse as spectacularly as England did last year on the final day. Shane Warne set up that victory, but his not around this time. I'll be back in ten minutes for the Indian innings.

 Innings Start
5.26 pm local time: Kumble has declared and play has been called off. the match is drawn and Australia take the series 2-1.
Adam Gilchrist receives hugs from all the Australian players. He and Ponting share a few words and then Kumble goes up to offer his congratulations. Gilchrist puts his arm around Kumble and shakes his hand. He walks off to a rousing ovation and leads the team off the field.
The PA then announced thanks for Gilchrist and "his magnificent career", at which point the ground rose as one. Then more cheers as he walked off the ground, the team staying behind standing on the pitch to cheer him off. He walks up the pavilion steps and it seems the rest of the team are reluctant to get off the pitch.
It's most likely the final Test for Tendulkar, Kumble, Dravid, Ganguly and Laxman as well in Australia and haven't they entertained the crowds here. Both teams shake hands at the end of a closely fought series. Australia have been the better team, not by much though, and win it 2-1 but India fought hard and not too many teams have been able to do that in Australia. I'll have the presentation ceremony for you in a bit.
Gilchrist is on the field with his family - his wife and three kids - and the photographers are queuing up to take his pictures. The teams are out there applauding him again.
The Man of the Match is Sachin Tendulkar for his 153 in the first innings. It was possibly his last Test in Australia and he's made it memorable. The Man of the Series is Brett Lee, who's been awesome with 24 wickets in the series and 40 in the entire summer. He drops his glass trophy but it survives the fall without damage.
Anil Kumble: "It was a tough, hard series. I'd like to congratulate Ricky and his team and my team-mates for a fantastic effort. On behalf of the Indian team, Adam congratulations on a fantastic career and all the best for the future. It's very tough to tour Australia and we showed that we could compete with the best."
Adam Gilchrist: "Thank you very much for the over whelming support since my announcement a few days ago. I've been stunned and I really appreciate it. Congratulations to Anil and his team for fighting hard right through the series. Thank you to my team-mates, for all your support throughout my career." He says he's looking forward to spending time with his family now to make up for time lost with them during his career.
Ricky Ponting: "It's been an enjoyable series played in great spirit. The Indian team can be proud of what they've achieved on this tour and they are now the No 2 side in the world.
"Adam Gilchrist is a once in a generation player, with the ability of changing the course of a match with the bat. He's been an electrifying batsman. I've thoroughly enjoyed every moment playing with him. Gilly, for me it's been an absolute please, congratulations mate and I hope we continue to catch up after our cricket careers are over."
The rest of the team goes up to join Ponting and the Australians pose with the Border-Gavaskar trophy, which they've retained. It's been an eventful series to say the least. We've had a lot of controversy but more importantly we've witnessed a lot of fantastic cricket too.
Thank you for all your emails right through this series. On behalf of all the other commentators through the four Tests - Jenny Thompson, Anand Vasu and Jamie Alter - this is George Binoy signing off. See you all for the Twenty20 international and the CB Series which follows. It will be Gilchrist's final international series and a last chance to watch him open the batting again. Good bye Gilly - from the Test circuit - and thank you for the entertainment.
