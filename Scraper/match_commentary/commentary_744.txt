So, the target for India is 214. They turned in a fine bowling display at the start to leave Australia stuttering, and backed it up with some electric fielding to cash in on some frenetic running between the wickets from the Australian batsmen. Hayden managed 54 before Haddin and Hogg put on a vital stand. It threatened more, as India just looked to have slipped, but Haddin's wicket in the 45th over saw Australia collapse and finish in the 49th over.

Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's live coverage of the final league match of the tournament between India and Australia in Kuala Lumpur. I'm Jamie Alter and, with George Binoy, will be bringing you all the action as it unfolds at the Kinrara Oval.
I don't need to remind you of the significance of this match, which promises to be a cracker because it's a virtual semi-final. Both teams want a final spot against West Indies on Sunday.
Something that needs mentioning as well: India are facing the phenomenon that is Michael Hussey for the first time. Despite the importance of the match, Australia will continue the rotation policy which has seen them give 18 different players a chance in the tournament. India, on their part, may bring in Irfan Pathan to add some depth to the batting, in which case Rudra Pratap Singh would make way.
The weather report includes shattered showers later in the day, but the experts have not expressed major concern over this.
The captains are out there for the toss with Ian Bishop and Chris Broad, the match referee. Ricky Ponting has flipped, Rahul Dravid has called tails, the result is heads and Ponting has decided to bat.
Australia have dropped Michael Clarke, Shane Watson and Nathan Bracken for Brad Hogg, Damien Martyn and Glenn McGrath. Some surprise changes for India, who have replaced Yuvraj Singh and Sreesanth for Mohammad Kaif and Dinesh Mongia.
 Innings Start
Mongia is left stranded on 63 but you have to question his decision to keep taking singles and exposing the tailenders. It would have been commended had it come off but fact is that it didn't work.
Lee's fibe wickets came at all the right times He dismissed Tendulkar and Sehwag cheaply, came back and broke a threatening partnership by snaring Dhoni before returning at the death to snap up the tail. Mongia's 63 was the only meaningful contribution in the Indian innings.
Australia have won by 18 runs and have secured a place in Sunday's final againt West Indies. India on the other hand will be packing their bags to return home. It's been a very eventful day with more than a fair share of controversy. Do read S Rajesh's bulletin for more details.
Lee wins the Man-of-the-Match award for his searing spell. He deserves it too! A word though for Haddin and Hogg who came together when Australia were sinking at 117 for 6 and wrested the initiative from India with some superb and sensible strokeplay.
Well that's it from us at Cricinfo. Do join us on Sunday when Australia take on West Indies in the final. Cheers!

India have a smallish target to chase - 214. However their batting - Tendulkar aside - has failed in this series and Australia will come out firing with Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee.
The pitch is on the slower side and the ball won't come on to the bat easily. In the last game between these two sides India made a cautious start before rain interrupted play. When they resumed, Mitchell Johnson sliced through the top order and five wickets fell for 15 runs. India wouldn't have forgotten that collapse. Australia do not have the services of Johnson today but they do have Lee to provide the firepower.
The weather report brings bad tidings. Showers are forecast for later in the evening and we could have another Duckworth/Lewis situtation.
For the moment though it's dry and the Australians are out on the field for their warm-ups.
Brett Lee has the new ball. India are opening with Tendulkar and Sehwag who will take strike.
