Data
Day 1: That means Australia will start fresh first thing tomorrow morning. A good day for the hosts after winning the toss. Their fast men, barring Johnson, have contributed. Sri Lanka will be disappointed with this considering they had two batsmen who passed fifty and looked set to score more. They will look back at some shots with regret. There were periods when Australia looked a bit flat, but regular wickets kept the hosts interested. Nevertheless this was an improvement from SL's performance at the MCG on the opening day.
Thanks for joining us. Plenty to read in the coming hours on this game, starting with the report. Do join us tomorrow and thanks for your company!

Joseph: "If the increasingly worried commentary from the channel 9 cheerleaders is anything to go by, I think Clarke could well be regretting this declaration if Sri Lanka keep this up. Great to finally see a competitive test in this series." Are we overestimating Bird's batting ability here? Just asking.
 Innings Start
The presentation starts:
Jackson Bird if the Man of the Match: "Busy 18 months. I suppose it feels like a "home" Test match. Been great fun. Good to see Huss off on a good note. I was more nervous getting those first runs out of the way."
Jayawardene: "When we came here it was a great opportunity. We needed to play a Test in these venues. We will learn from this. The quicks were not getting much out of this, we should have posted a much better total. The boys fought well in the end. That's the future for us (Chandimal etc) and there will be more players coming in and it will be tough but they should learn from these defeats."
Michael Clarke is the Man of the Series: "We had to work hard. I thought Lyon did a good job in the first innings, credit to Wade for the way he played. Another man down unfortunately (Hussey). What an amazing player, a great team man. Our plan was to win six out of six so a bit disappointed. We haven't been consistent enough. But we've got a team that's working very hard. So 2013 is the year of the Australian cricket team so that's why we are here."
The Australian team poses for photos. Hussey is carried off by Peter Siddle and Mitchell Johnson. He will run in and sing the team song, one last time.
Just a few words for Sri Lanka. They have now lost four in a row, having conceded the Colombo Test against New Zealand before coming here. Jayawardene leaves the captaincy on a low, but one would hope that Angelo Mathews can raise his game when he takes on his new role. They've got some talented players to take them forward. One just needs to be patient. Things just didn't click on this tour and the lack of runs from seniors like Mahela and Samaraweera didn't help. Here's wishing them a better 2013, though they won't be playing many Tests, sadly. That's a discussion for another day.
That's it from us here. More analysis on the Test and the series coming up from Andrew Fernando, Dan Brettig and Brydon Coverdale. Thanks for joining us. It's been a pleasure covering the last two Tests, despite the graveyard timings. Thanks for the feedback. Cheers!
End of match: All the Sri Lanka players come forward and shake Michael Hussey's hand. The Sri Lankan reserve players come out and Hussey walks across to them as well. He leads the team off the field. The coaching staff are out as well.
Hussey: "Couldn't be happier. It was nice to be out there in the end. Has to be one of my top three favourite grounds in the world. I'd just like to be remembered as a good team man, really. Singing the team song will probably be what I will miss the most."
.
Who will sing the team song now? Hussey says," I will let it out now, I will hand it over to Nathan Lyon." Yes, Lyon it is.
Warner: "I think he will be embarrassed he didn't hit the winning runs. I think we are going to step up as youngsters. I'm feeling really good at the moment (about my batting). Getting two games off is good for me. Those 15 days against SA hurt us. To win here and see Huss here is fantastic."
Hussey's kids hug him. He poses for photos with them.
Aditya: "Wow. The whole world wants Hussey to take the winning run. He says screw that. I only care about the team winning. Absolute hero."
As Hussey said, he was a team man through and through. His is a lesson for late-bloomers, in all walks of life.
Nathan Lyon speaks: "When Mike told me (about the team song) I was shocked. I hope to learn more from Hussey.
