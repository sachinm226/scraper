That's it for the day. It was a cracking day of Test cricket, with momentum ebbing and flowing. The batsmen dominating at times, with the bowlers coming back in strongly. On occasion the spin reigned supreme, at others, express pace was more lethal. Defensive batting won the first session, while Rizwan's counter-punching and Yasir's insouciance did Pakistan much good too.
Enjoyable day to start the series, and Australia come out fresh tomorrow. I can't wait, and I look forward to joining you guys. From us for today, goodbye!
86.2;W;Starc to Naseem Shah, OUT and that's it. Naseem's spirited, brief resistance comes to an end. Caught on the crease, Naseem got a top edge that went straight up, allowing Starc to get underneath it and pouch the simplest of catches. Pakistan all out for 240;Naseem Shah c & b Starc 7 (28m 12b 1x4 0x6) SR: 58.33;
86.1;?;Starc to Naseem Shah, no run short and quick, Naseem ducks;
85.6;?;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, no run dropped! Imran finally gets an edge on one that had been due a few overs. No foot movement at all, and fourth slip appeared to be taken by surprise. The dive to the left came against the body weight of Labuschagne, and in the end he snatched at it.;
85.5;?;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, no run targets the stumps, the batsman gets in line behind that nicely;
85.4;?;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, no run beats the edge and the off-stump again. This is excellent bowling from the world's very best;
85.3;?;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, no run mean short delivery, Imran gets underneath it;
85.2;?;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, no run beats the outside edge again. That was devilishly close to the bat. Expect an increase in intensity again, since a wicket means the end of the day;
85.1;?;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, no run play and a miss. Australia will, in all likelihood, not need to bat today even if the last wicket falls now;
84.6;4;Starc to Naseem Shah, FOUR runs 144kph yorker, and Naseem tonks it straight down the ground for four. Starc yorker? No problem for the 16-year old!;
84.5;?;Starc to Naseem Shah, no run 146.5, that. Naseem was gearing up for another bouncer, but Starc came up with a length delivery. Just about dig it out;
84.4;?;Starc to Naseem Shah, no run another short delivery. Think Australia might genuinely be wanting to ensure they don't need to bat today.;
84.4;1w;Starc to Naseem Shah, 1 wide short and well over the batsman's head. Umpire deems it to be a wide;
84.3;2;Starc to Naseem Shah, 2 runs 145.4 kph yorker, and Naseem digs another one out. Gets it through point and the batsmen add another useful two to the score;
84.2;?;Starc to Naseem Shah, no run another wild swing, another complete miss;
84.1;?;Starc to Naseem Shah, no run drives on the up, misses again. Starc is redlining his game, the pace consistently above 145 now;
81.6;1;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, 1 run Imran gets off the mark, and perhaps mercifully, keeps the strike. Naseem will be shielded from Starc for now;
81.5;?;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, no run defended to point;
81.4;W;Cummins to Shafiq, OUT that's a ripper. Never mind about the tail, Cummins has cleaned Shafiq up. Did the tail mess with his concentration? Just left a huge gap between bat and pad, and the ball jagged back, going right through it to rattle middle stump. Shafiq goes for a well-made 76; you'd think Australia will bat a few overs today;Asad Shafiq b Cummins 76 (203m 134b 7x4 0x6) SR: 56.71;
81.3;?;Cummins to Shafiq, no run outside off, Shafiq leaves;
81.2;?;Cummins to Shafiq, no run driven through a vacant in-field; they don't take a run;
81.1;?;Cummins to Shafiq, no run line and length, defended. The field is all out; they're handing a single to him on a platter, as you'd expect;
80.6;?;Starc to Naseem Shah, no run he had no clue, did he? Gets a thick inside edge and sets off to get a single without even looking at Asad. Asad's not interested, he'd rather have the strike instead. Who could argue with that?;
80.5;W;Starc to Shaheen Shah Afridi, OUT big appeal for caught behind. There was a huge appeal, and in all honesty there was a sound. Paine belatedly reviews. And there's a clear nick. Shaheen is on his way! Starc is on a hat-trick;Shaheen Shah Afridi c ?Paine b Starc 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
80.4;W;Starc to Yasir Shah, OUT cleans him up; this is what makes Starc so lethal! Perfect yorker, right in the gap between bat and pad. Yasir tried to sort his feet out but it goes straight through the gate and clatters into middle stump. Will Starc run through the rest now?;Yasir Shah b Starc 26 (99m 83b 2x4 0x6) SR: 31.32;
80.3;?;Starc to Yasir Shah, no run big appeal, this is close. Pitched on or close to leg stump, and after a long appeal, they decide against reviewing it;
80.2;?;Starc to Yasir Shah, no run full and straight. Play and a miss from Yasir;
80.1;1;Starc to Shafiq, 1 run good, hostile start. Shafiq caught on the wrong foot and poked one uppishly into the onside;
83.6;?;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, no run stellar defensive shot to conclude the over;
83.5;?;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, no run drags his length back, very close to the outside edge once more. Living on borrowed time, these two;
83.4;4;Cummins to Md Imran Khan, FOUR runs gets a top edge that flies over the slips. Every run counts;
83.3;1;Cummins to Naseem Shah, 1 run yorker, and Naseem digs it out, and gets his first Test run;
83.2;?;Cummins to Naseem Shah, no run swung wildly at that one, connected with fresh air. The ball was barely in the same postcode as the swishing blade;
83.1;?;Cummins to Naseem Shah, no run short, delivery that kicks up off the surface. Little Naseem could do about that;
82.6;?;Starc to Md Imran Khan, no run full toss. Imran gets a thick outside edge that rolls along to the slips. Naseem will have to face the music now. Cummins to bowl;
82.5;?;Starc to Md Imran Khan, no run clears the front leg and decides to heave at this. Beaten for bounce, with the ball sailing over his head through to Paine;
82.4;?;Starc to Md Imran Khan, no run driven to short extra;
82.3;?;Starc to Md Imran Khan, no run back of a length, Imran defends fairly confidently. Think it's a bit harsh to send him in below Naseem;
82.2;?;Starc to Md Imran Khan, no run pushed wide of off stump, Imran prods uncertainly, missing the outside edge;
82.1;?;Starc to Md Imran Khan, no run thick inside edge onto the pad. Starc is in the mood to finish this off this over;

79.4;?;Smith to Shafiq, no run defended through the offside;
79.3;4;Smith to Shafiq, FOUR runs full toss. Meat and drink for Shafiq, who dispatches it to the long-on boundary;
79.2;1;Smith to Yasir Shah, 1 run not that one. Filthy long hop, lucky to only concede one;
79.1;?;Smith to Yasir Shah, no run bowls legspin, thankfully. Good delivery, actually;
78.6;?;Labuschagne to Shafiq, no run quicker through the air, Shafiq punches through the offside;
78.5;1;Labuschagne to Yasir Shah, 1 run the bug's got Yasir now. Smart sweep from him, gets cow corner involved agian;

77.1;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run blocked;

76.5;?;Labuschagne to Shafiq, no run a tad short, and cut away to cover-point again;
76.4;4;Labuschagne to Shafiq, FOUR runs gets it through this time. He's been trying to pierce the gap between mid-off and extra cover, and finally capitalises on the width to get it exactly where he wants;

74.6;?;Labuschagne to Yasir Shah, no run driven to mid-off;

74.4;1;Labuschagne to Shafiq, 1 run cut backward of square;
74.3;2;Labuschagne to Shafiq, 2 runs brings the sweep out, and the 200 comes up Also the fifty-partnership. Great fightback from these two;

53.2;?;Hazlewood to Rizwan, no run 135kph, good length, fourth stump line, he defends on the front foot. Lovely stride forward and plays under his eyes;
53.1;?;Hazlewood to Rizwan, no run 139kph, fuller and a hint of shape back towards off, he makes a tight leave. That wasn't far away but a good leave in the end;

52.2;4;Cummins to Rizwan, FOUR runs 135kph, fuller length wide of off, he pushes with hard hands and it runs through backward point and races away! Amazing timing;
52.1;4;Cummins to Rizwan, FOUR runs 136kph, half volley on leg stump and Rizwan clips is away beautifully! Lovely shot. But a surprisingly poor delivery.;
51.6;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run defended, and that brings about as good a session as Justin Langer could have dreamed of;
51.5;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run around the wicket, and it nearly produces instant results. Shafiq lost his balance slightly, and the extra bounce nearly claimed the edge of the bat;
51.4;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run jabbed to the onside. Keeps it low;
51.3;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run once more. He's playing the ball late, which is the best way to handle Lyon;

51.1;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run moves out of his crease, flicked to midwicket;

50.5;4;Cummins to Rizwan, FOUR runs magnificent shot from Rizwan. Perfect balance, allows the ball to get right to him, and when it's just underneath his eyes, just prods at it back past the bowler;
50.4;1;Cummins to Shafiq, 1 run back-foot punch, and the pair scamper a quick single;

49.3;1;Lyon to Shafiq, 1 run confident! Comes down the wicket and flicks it in the air to midwicket. Gets a single, but he's taking risks all of a sudden. Not sure it's necessary;

47.4;?;Lyon to Shafiq, no run defended. Lyon is in his element now;
47.3;3;Lyon to Rizwan, 3 runs shorter, allowing the batsman to male room for himself and carve it through point. Sharp fielding on the boundary keeps it to three;
47.2;?;Lyon to Rizwan, no run nice line and pace. rizwan goes deep inside his crease and defends;
47.1;1;Lyon to Shafiq, 1 run once again, Asad lulled into an expansive shot through the offside, and just about avoids getting a tickle on it;

46.2;1;Starc to Shafiq, 1 run whipped down to fine leg;
46.1;4;Starc to Shafiq, FOUR runs that might be the shot of the day. Bit of width on offer and he leans into another silky cover drive. Teases David Warner in the chase, but trickles over the fence;
45.6;?;Lyon to Rizwan, no run manages to keep it down, so Labuschagne can't get into the game. Fantastic first over post-lunch from Lyon;
45.5;?;Lyon to Rizwan, no run defended through the offside;

45.2;?;Lyon to Rizwan, no run nice flight, dead-batted;
45.1;W;Lyon to Iftikhar, OUT Lyon strikes first ball! Pretty careless from the batsman. Steps out to defend in front of his body, gets a thick inside edge onto his pad, and short leg is standing to gleefully pouch the easiest catch. Soft, soft dismissal. Australia insurgent;Iftikhar Ahmed c Labuschagne b Lyon 7 (28m 18b 1x4 0x6) SR: 38.88;
44.6;?;Starc to Shafiq, no run swing! Came back in much more sharply and beat Shafiq on the inside edge. Hits his pads, though much too high for any real excitement;

44.4;?;Starc to Shafiq, no run yorker length, driven to mid-off;
44.3;?;Starc to Shafiq, no run three in a row. Shafiq appears to steer clear of anything from Starc he doesn't need to play right now;

43.6;?;Cummins to Iftikhar, no run defends deftly to end the over;
43.5;4;Cummins to Iftikhar, FOUR runs driven on the up. Maybe that's why they're bowling short to him. Went fuller this time, and Iftikhar had no qualms about stepping out to greet the ball and dismiss it through cover point. One of the best shots of the day;
43.4;?;Cummins to Iftikhar, no run banged in short. Iftikhar is being peppered with this length right now. Gets out of the way;

41.6;?;Cummins to Shafiq, no run lovely ball to end a probing over. Just beats the outside edge;

41.4;?;Cummins to Shafiq, no run bang on off stump, defended;
41.3;4;Cummins to Shafiq, FOUR runs sweetly driven by Shafiq. Punched back past the bowler; it was all timing that created that shot. Perfect balance, rock-solid technique, ideal result;

41.1;?;Cummins to Shafiq, no run short, and at the body. Blocked;
40.6;?;Starc to Iftikhar, no run short again, Iftikhar ducks;
40.5;?;Starc to Iftikhar, no run Iftikhar shoulders arms. Starc honing in on that shorter length now;
40.4;?;Starc to Iftikhar, no run mean bouncer, and Starc follows it up with an extravagant follow-through. Iftikhar gets out of the way, but unlike some of the short stuff, this was very well-directed;
40.3;3;Starc to Shafiq, 3 runs gorgeously driven. Exquisite transfer of weight through his body and into the off-drive. It's a teaser for the fielder, and the batsmen run three;
40.2;?;Starc to Shafiq, no run some movement off the seam. Asad shoulders arms. He is so, so crucial to this innings now;
40.1;?;Starc to Shafiq, no run lets this go;

 Innings Start
Innings break Australia all out for 580. They lead by 340. Marnus Labuschagne and David Warner made magnificent centuries. Burns and Wade provided great support. Only six times in test history have Australia's top three have made more runs in an innings. Yasir Shah finishes with four wickets but he conceded 200 in an innings for the third time, which is a record.
Pakistan have 17 overs to survive tonight. Danyal will take you through to stumps.

137.1;?;Haris Sohail to Labuschagne, no run defended;
136.6;4;Yasir Shah to Head, FOUR runs too full outside off stump, and Head pierces the gap between mid on and wide extra cover. He's come in looking like as settled as the man on 150;

135.2;3;Haris Sohail to Head, 3 runs thick outside edge on a fuller delivery again. Rizwan the man who has the chase ahead of him, and dives on the boundary to prevent arun. Brilliant work from the wicketkeeper. That's the lunge of a man newly into the team!;
135.1;?;Haris Sohail to Head, no run driven back;

134.5;?;Yasir Shah to Head, no run defended;
134.4;?;Yasir Shah to Head, no run tucked down to fine leg. They think about a run, and think better of it;
134.3;4;Yasir Shah to Head, FOUR runs wonderful batting. Ever so slightly short and Head pounces on this to send it racing past point;
134.2;?;Yasir Shah to Head, no run looking to exploit the footmarks by going wider of off stump. Head watchfully leaves;

133.5;?;Haris Sohail to Head, no run defended;

132.4;1;Yasir Shah to Head, 1 run worked away to the onside, and Head is off the mark;
132.3;1;Yasir Shah to Labuschagne, 1 run in the air, perilously so for a moment it seemed. Opened the face of the bat and went over cover. Was in a gap in the end, but unconvincing from the batsman for once;

131.6;W;Haris Sohail to Wade, OUT and Wade nicks off to Rizwan! He looked to open the face and run it down to third man.

130.6;?;Shaheen Shah Afridi to Labuschagne, no run solid defence to end the over;
130.5;?;Shaheen Shah Afridi to Labuschagne, no run blocked on the offside. Labuschagne wanted a single, and made a comically exaggerated point about it to Wade. Wade was neither amused nor inclined, it appears;
130.4;?;Shaheen Shah Afridi to Labuschagne, no run fuller length, driven straight back;
130.3;1;Shaheen Shah Afridi to Wade, 1 run stopped on him a little bit. Went at the drive too early. Quick single too, and Wade gets copped on the hand by the throw. That'll sting;

128.3;?;Shaheen Shah Afridi to Labuschagne, no run play and miss, at a clever slower ball. 123kph, off spinner type slower ball, it beat the edge as he was driving too early at it. Well bowled;

Thick outside edge that pieces the gap where Pakistan decided against having a fourth slip. He kisses the badge, embraces Wade and acknowledges the crowd and his family. Love moment;
106.3;?;Shaheen Shah Afridi to Labuschagne, no run driven crisply back to the bowler;
106.2;?;Shaheen Shah Afridi to Labuschagne, no run and again. Pakistan might prey on his nervousness as he approaches his first Test century.;
