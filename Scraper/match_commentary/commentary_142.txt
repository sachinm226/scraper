Data
12.50pm Only once has a team lost a Test after scoring 400 or more in an innings at the WACA. For those in the UK, meanwhile, here is the moment Jonny Bairstow brought up an emotional hundred.
Another tidbit: Austin Waugh, son of Steve, and Will Sutherland, son of CA chief executive James Sutherland, have been picked in Australia's squad for the Under-19 World Cup
12.40pm Phew, that escalated quickly. After not losing a wicket in the post-tea session on the first day, England have lost 6 for 35.. Before that collapse, YJB reached his fourth Test hundred and added 237 for the fifth wicket with Malan - the highest stand for England v Australia in Tests. Alan will be back for the start of the post-lunch session. Cheers
115.1;W;Starc to Broad, OUT Starc bounces out Broad and wraps up England for 403. Broad ventures a long way across the off stump and aims to hook it over to long leg. Instead, he cue-ends a catch to forward short leg;Stuart Broad c Bancroft b Starc 12 (22m 10b 0x4 1x6) SR: 120;
114.6;?;Hazlewood to Anderson, no run low full-toss on off, jabbed back to the bowler;
114.5;?;Hazlewood to Anderson, no run Anderson keeps moving across off, he misses the glance, and the ball bounces over leg stump;
114.4;?;Hazlewood to Anderson, no run dug short and down leg, Anderson, having ventured across off, runs it away fine. Paine dives to his right and makes another superb stop;
114.3;1;Hazlewood to Broad, 1 run Broad takes on the short ball and hooks away to long leg;
114.2;6;Hazlewood to Broad, SIX runs Broad has a big yahooooo at it and sends the ball sailing past square leg and the score past 400. He steps away outside leg and swings it over the boundary. Was it top edged? Broad would say he nailed Hazlewood over the fence;
114.1;?;Hazlewood to Broad, no run Broad slinks outside leg, uppercuts and misses, as this one soars over the stumps;
113.6;?;Starc to Anderson, no run head-hunting short ball, angling away, Anderson yanks his head away;

113.4;?;Starc to Anderson, no run Anderson wanders across off, Starc sprays it down leg, past the bat;
113.3;?;Starc to Anderson, no run ooooh, Jimmy shuffles across off and nearly fends it back onto his stumps. Short, curving away, he fends it just wide as the ball trickles square past the leg stump;
113.2;3;Starc to Broad, 3 runs Broad backs away outside leg and exposes all three stumps. Starc goes outside off, Broad hits it over the top. Lifted over extra cover. Lyon chases, Broad takes three and exposes Jimmy to Starc. Not a great idea from Broad;
113.1;?;Starc to Broad, no run back of a length, angling away from over the wicket, ducking away past the outside edge;
112.6;W;Hazlewood to Overton, OUT Fire and brimstone at the WACA! Accurate short ball, just over the chest, Overton sits back and aims to fend it off. Instead, he only loops it off the glove to Bancroft under the helmet short leg;Craig Overton c Bancroft b Hazlewood 2 (13m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57;
112.5;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run short and homing in at the head of Overton, he avoids it;
112.4;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run rising short ball outside off, patted down to cover;
112.3;1;Hazlewood to Broad, 1 run glanced in the air but to the left of a diving Bancroft at short leg;
112.2;?;Hazlewood to Broad, no run chest-high short ball on middle, Broad hops and fends it down;
112.1;?;Hazlewood to Broad, no run more sweet-chin music, shuffles across off and prods it wide of short leg. Think it did not carry to Bancroft there;
69.6;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run pitched up and clouted towards cover, half-stopped on the dive and they think better of chancing a run;
69.5;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run banged in short, snaking bouncer but Bairstow avoids being bitten as he leans back;
69.4;1;Cummins to Malan, 1 run pitched up and driven with a flourish to the cover sweeper;
69.3;?;Cummins to Malan, no run length, 137kph but slightly wide and he leaves alone;
69.2;4;Cummins to Malan, FOUR runs short and slashed, room to swing the arms and Malan gleefully steers it past gully, in the air but out of reach of the diving Khawaja;
69.1;?;Cummins to Malan, no run pitched up and defended on off stump;
68.6;1;Lyon to Malan, 1 run tossed up and met coming forwards for one more down the ground to long-off;
68.5;?;Lyon to Malan, no run flighted on off, Malan covers the line and pushes back to the bowler;
68.4;1;Lyon to Bairstow, 1 run tossed up worked into a gap on the leg side;
68.3;1;Lyon to Malan, 1 run floated up a touch wider and punched to cover;
68.2;4;Lyon to Malan, FOUR runs smoothly done, Malan skips down and laces a drive to the long-on boundary - and like Stoneman, he's got a new Test best today, too;
68.1;1;Lyon to Bairstow, 1 run flighted, over the wicket and spinning in, worked around the corner and they trot one;
111.6;?;Starc to Overton, no run back of a length and skidding across off, Overton tucks his bat inside the line and lets it go again;

111.3;1;Starc to Broad, 1 run short and angling away, has Broad hopping, and fending wide of short leg;
111.2;W;Starc to Bairstow, OUT Starc returns and floors the middle stump. This is pretty full - not quite a yorker - and jags back in. Bairstow aims for a leg-side flick, but doesn't account for the inward movement. The ball takes the inside edge and rattles the stumps. England have lost four wickets in six overs. Nonetheless, excellent innings from YJB;Jonny Bairstow b Starc 119 (319m 215b 18x4 0x6) SR: 55.34;
111.1;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run good length ball on middle, he covers up in defence;
110.6;?;Hazlewood to Overton, no run dug in on middle, Overton camps back and fends it off;
110.5;W;Hazlewood to Woakes, OUT Cummins runs in from long leg dives forward to snap up a smart catch. Good change-up from Hazlewood: he follows up a very full ball with a shorter one on the hips. Woakes shapes for a flick-pull but ends up flapping a catch to the man in the deep. Make that three wickets in five overs;Chris Woakes c Cummins b Hazlewood 8 (17m 12b 2x4 0x6) SR: 66.66;
110.4;4;Hazlewood to Woakes, FOUR runs pitched up and outside off, right up Woakes' alley. He leans out and creams a drive through the covers. So easy on the eye;
110.3;1;Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 run back of a length and straighter in line, tucked to deep midwicket;
110.2;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run back of a length on off, punched off the front foot to cover;
110.1;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run dug in short and angling in just a shade outside off, YJB bails out of the hook;
109.6;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run short on middle, boings off the deck and flies into the gloves of Paine as the batsman rocks his head out of the way;
109.5;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run and now Cummins pushes him back with a short ball on middle. Fended away to the leg side;
109.4;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run follows the short stuff with a much fuller ball. Woakes is concentrating as his assured footwork suggests. He presses right forward to negotiate it;
109.3;4;Cummins to Woakes, FOUR runs Woakes splices an outside edge to the third-man boundary. Short and climbs outside off, Woakes has a crack at it and sends it flying past the right of second slip;

108.6;4;Hazlewood to Bairstow, FOUR runs back of a length and width, Bairstow latches onto it and chops it hard onto the ground, sending the ball skipping over Lyon at point;
108.5;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run pitched up and outside off, presses out and dabs to cover;
108.4;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run banged down leg, he gets inside the line and lets it go;

108.2;4;Hazlewood to Bairstow, FOUR runs full and hung up wide outside off - wider than a set of stumps outside off - Bairstow flashes an outside edge past second slip. The ball streaks away to the third-man boundary;
108.1;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run good length and outside off, no shot;
107.6;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run Cummins has Woakes hopping and skipping. He rushes the batsman for pace and forces him to fend to leg;

107.3;?;Cummins to Woakes, no run dug in on middle, sails over the left shoulder of Woakes to the keeper;
107.2;W;Cummins to Ali, OUT Just like that Australia have plucked out two wickets in four balls! Cummins runs in hard, hits the pitch harder, and bounces out Moeen. This one bursts from a back of a length outside off, Moeen stays leg side of the ball and has a flirt at it. He winds up gloving it behind to Smith at wide-ish second slip;Moeen Ali c Smith b Cummins 0 (6m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
107.1;?;Cummins to Ali, no run feisty bouncer, ducks under it;
106.6;4;Lyon to Bairstow, FOUR runs sprayed on the pads, glanced fine on the leg side;
106.5;W;Lyon to Malan, OUT It takes a terrific catch from the sub fielder - Handscomb - to end a terrific stand. Malan dares to step out and hit against the break over wide mid-on/midwicket. He is nowhere close to the pitch of this offbreak and ends up skewing it to backward point, where Handscomb judges it expertly and completes a sprawling catch - horizontal to the ground. The fifth-wicket stand ends at 237 - 18 shy of the all-time record for England;Dawid Malan c sub (PSP Handscomb) b Lyon 140 (322m 227b 19x4 1x6) SR: 61.67;
106.4;?;Lyon to Malan, no run tossed outside off, blocked to the covers again;

106.1;?;Lyon to Malan, no run slower offbreak, starts outside off and turns away, left alone;

105.5;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run dug down leg, the batsman sneaks inside the line and lets it go;
105.4;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run yet another short ball on middle, Bairstow ducks again;

104.4;?;Lyon to Malan, no run straight ball, pushed back to Lyon again;
104.3;?;Lyon to Malan, no run tossed on middle, not much turn, forward and defended back to Lyon;
104.2;1;Lyon to Bairstow, 1 run thigh-high short ball on off, YJB swats it off the back foot to deep midwicket;
104.1;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run pushed through on off, defended with the break to forward short leg;
103.6;?;Cummins to Malan, no run Cummins gets it to zip from the deck and rise at Malan, he, however, rides the bounce and cautiously fends it out to point;
103.5;1;Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run back of a length and a bit too straight in line, allowing YJB to flick a single down to long leg;

103.3;?;Cummins to Malan, no run back of a length and largely holds its line outside off, crisply punched on the up to cover;
103.2;?;Cummins to Malan, no run another short ball, angling in towards the throat of Malan. He has his eyes locked on it before swaying his upper body out of the way;
103.1;?;Cummins to Malan, no run lifter outside off, Malan ponders about a hook, but belatedly decides to let it pass;
102.6;?;Lyon to Bairstow, no run faster, flatter, angling across off, blocked back to the bowler;

101.5;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run tigher from Cummins this over, YJB comes across and defends;

101.1;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run shortish and defended on off stump;
100.6;4;Marsh to Malan, FOUR runs short and wide and Malan slashes it away through gully for four more. Australia's earlier parsimony a distant memory now;
100.5;1;Marsh to Bairstow, 1 run there it is! Takes the short ball and swings it down to fine leg, Bairstow has his fourth Test hundred and first in the Ashes! An immaculate knock, fully justifying his promotion to No6, and it's helped put England well on top;
100.4;?;Marsh to Bairstow, no run pitched up and clipped to square leg, no run there;
100.3;?;Marsh to Bairstow, no run short ball, that's well directed, YJB crouches and lets it go;

100.1;4;Marsh to Bairstow, FOUR runs smashed through the off side, Bairstow stands tall in the crease and rasps four more - he's within a shot of his century now;
99.6;4;Cummins to Malan, FOUR runs short, wide and crunched for another boundary! Malan is opening up as he dispatches a cut;
99.5;?;Cummins to Malan, no run slammed in short and this flies through well over the crouching Malan, Paine has to stretch every sinew to take it with his fingertips;
99.4;2b;Cummins to Malan, 2 byes short and it evades everyone, Paine can't prevent a couple of byes;
99.3;4;Cummins to Malan, FOUR runs full and wide, not much to worry about when the ball isn't swinging and Malan carves it away to deep backward point, four more;

98.4;?;Marsh to Bairstow, no run good length, bit of shape away as he leaves;
98.3;2;Marsh to Bairstow, 2 runs full but too straight and Bairstow whips a couple wide of fine leg;

97.2;4;Cummins to Bairstow, FOUR runs lovely stroke, not all that full from Cummins but he steps across and times it beautifully on the up, outruns the fielder to the rope;
97.1;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run back of a length, 136kph, defended on off stump;
96.6;2;Hazlewood to Malan, 2 runs full outside off, tempts the drive and Malan flays elegantly through the covers, came off the toe of the bat, I think, and it's just another brace;
96.5;2;Hazlewood to Malan, 2 runs dug in, Malan seems a little late on the pull but manages to get it away safely through midwicket for a couple;
96.4;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run length, climbing through outside off, no need to play at it;

96.1;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run banged in short but sliding down the leg side, Malan pulls out of his half-hearted cross-batted shot... and I think Smith appealed for a caught behind? Odd;

94.4;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run fired in straighter, YJB clips it towards midwicket;
94.3;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run comes across and taps a length ball away;

94.1;1;Hazlewood to Malan, 1 run round the wicket, short of a length over the stumps and Malan turns it off his hip for another single;
93.6;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run full on the stumps again, nicely played coming half forwards but mid-on slides to stop the drive and prevent any more additions to the total;
93.5;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run touch fuller, swerving menacingly on middle and leg, thuds into the pads - but Bairstow had got some bat on it;
93.4;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run length ball, 142kph and this takes off on its way past the batsman, Paine clinging on to an exocet above his head;
93.3;1;Starc to Malan, 1 run a run! Starc slings down another attempted toe-crusher but this swings a touch down the leg side and Malan glances to fine leg, to get the scoreboard creaking into life in the fifth over of the day;

91.4;?;Starc to Malan, no run good length in the corridor, comes across and leaves alone;
91.3;?;Starc to Malan, no run crashing into the pads, Malan stuck on the crease... Erasmus shakes his head, Starc looks anguished! Was it sliding down? Australia go for the review, though it seems more in hope than expectation; yes, replays quickly show that Malan was standing on leg, it hit him just about in line, but would have missed the timbers according to Hawk-Eye - so Australia lose their second review, and they won't get them back, either;
91.2;?;Starc to Malan, no run length, 143kph and pushed down into the off side;
91.1;?;Starc to Malan, no run oof, not far from playing on! Pitched up and Malan prods at it, thick-edged into his pads and it wheechs past leg stump;

90.1;?;Hazlewood to Bairstow, no run fullish around off, pushed back towards the bowler as YJB comes across;
89.6;?;Starc to Malan, no run finishes with a bumper, over the stumps and over the crouching Malan - a maiden to start the day;
89.5;?;Starc to Malan, no run sung down the leg side, Paine has to throw himself across to prevent byes;
89.4;?;Starc to Malan, no run straighter line, up to 143kph now, calmly tapped towards midwicket;
89.3;?;Starc to Malan, no run goes full, looking for the in-ducker I think, Malan drives but the bat seemed to turn in the hands and it dribbles to cover;
89.2;?;Starc to Malan, no run in the channel, 139kph and holding its line as the batsman comes forward and leaves;
89.1;?;Starc to Malan, no run unleashes a low full toss to begin with, Malan bunts it back to the bowler;

88.5;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run goes full and straight, delivered from wide on the crease, flicked to square leg;
88.4;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run well-judged leave, on length as much as line, in fact think it carried over off stump in the end;
88.3;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run that's a good 'un! Back of a length outside off, climbs past the outside edge to Paine;
88.2;?;Cummins to Bairstow, no run full outside off, good delivery, Bairstow comes forward and defends to point;

87.5;4;Hazlewood to Malan, FOUR runs that's a beauty! Full at off stump, eased straight of mid-off with a text-book perfect drive;
87.4;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run a short ball, he drops his gloves and arches out of the line;
87.3;?;Hazlewood to Malan, no run full at off stump, bat and pad together, solidly defended to cover;

85.5;4;Starc to Bairstow, FOUR runs aims for the yorker, it's a low full toss at off stump, skims off a thick outside edge between third slip and gully;
85.4;?;Starc to Bairstow, no run appeal for lbw as this shapes back on a full length and takes the pad, but did it pitch in line? No review from Smith. May have done too much as well;

SI Sam: "Pathetic over-rate as usual......both teams in all 3 Tests have been abysmal....but only captains like Tharanga and Holder get banned....the Big 3 always get away with it" Will be interesting to see how many South Africa and Zimbabwe bowl in the four-day Test, 98 overs per day
 Innings Start
Paul Dawson: "Dunno if you publish comments on comments, but Elvin's reference to Cardiff has lifted my spirits. "
Shahidul Arman: "As a England I'm looking for those guy who will say it's raining just 2/3 km away from the stadium."
1:27pm So Australia have batted 21 balls after lunch to declare. Neither the 300 lead, nor a half-century for a batsman has been achieved. The plan was to bat till No. 10 then. Paine's unbeaten on 49, Anderson's stopped one short of a five-for. And Broad has just finished with his worst figures in Tests, 0 for 142 in 35 overs. England will have to erase a deficit of 259.
179.3;W;Anderson to Lyon, OUT he's holed out and they've declared. Anderson goes full just outside off, Lyon clears the front leg and heaves for midwicket. Not quite the connection he hoped for. It's gone high and it's wobbly, but Moeen Ali is smart as he gets under it at mid-on;Nathan Lyon c Ali b Anderson 4 (8m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33;

179.1;?;Anderson to Lyon, no run back of a length and down leg side, no bat on the attempted glance;
178.6;?;Broad to Paine, no run short and wide and moving away after pitching. Paines heaves at this and might have got eight if he'd connected;
178.5;?;Broad to Paine, no run back of a length in the channel, defended on the back foot;
178.4;4;Broad to Paine, FOUR runs oh stunning shot. Springs down the track as Broad jumps into his delivery stride, and is right on top of this length ball at leg stump. Makes himself some extra pace and slaps it on the up, to the wide long-on fence;
178.3;?;Broad to Paine, no run back of a length at off stump, squeezed into the off side off the inside edge;
178.2;?;Broad to Paine, no run back of a length down leg side, looks to swivel and pull. Beaten;
178.1;?;Broad to Paine, no run length and into the pads as he looks to tickle this fine;
177.6;W;Anderson to Cummins, OUT we have another review for lbw. Another one that looks plumb too. It's an inswinger at middle stump, headed for leg. He looks to flick and can't get bat on it. It's given out. This is full and he hasn't moved too far forward. There is nothing to suggest and edge and ball tracking confirms this is hitting leg stump;Pat Cummins lbw b Anderson 41 (101m 63b 4x4 1x6) SR: 65.07;
177.5;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run good length at off stump, defended on the front foot;
177.4;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run full and into the pads, thuds him on the knee roll as he looks to flick;

177.2;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run back of a length, in at middle stump. Defended on the back foot;
177.1;?;Anderson to Cummins, no run hoops in to the batsman but this is too short to trouble him. Squeezed into the off side off the back foot;

176.4;?;Broad to Paine, no run back of a length and down leg side, can't get anything on the flick;

175.6;1;Ali to Cummins, 1 run touch short, cracked to fine leg with another meaty swing but they only get one - and that will be lunch;
175.5;?;Ali to Cummins, no run darted leg side as Cummins goes to sweep again, misses out;

173.3;?;Ali to Paine, no run floated up leg side and deflected away;
173.2;3;Ali to Cummins, 3 runs flighted, slightly leg side and Cummins sweeps powerfully past short fine leg, Overton is still putting in the effort and he barrels around from deep square-ish to slide and prevent four - wholehearted stuff;
173.1;?;Ali to Cummins, no run round the wicket, tossed up and tapped away;
172.6;4;Broad to Paine, FOUR runs in the channel, not a bad ball but it is struck superbly well by Paine, high elbow and placement behind the man in the deep, timing to swoon over and it screams into the ropes;
172.5;?;Broad to Paine, no run fullish and straight, plinked to mid-on half forward;
172.4;1lb;Broad to Cummins, 1 leg bye yowch, that's rearing off a short length and it takes Cummins on the elbow - maybe arm guard - and loops behind square;

169.6;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run angled in with the arm, 135kph and defended back down the track;
169.5;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run draws the drive, a big booming swing from Cummins, hand off the bat as it beats him and flies through to YJB;
169.4;4;Woakes to Cummins, FOUR runs shot! Just a glide off the back foot but he middles it and the ball races away past backward point - and the lead goes over 200, too;

169.2;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run length on off, Paine dabs one into the covers;
169.1;3;Woakes to Cummins, 3 runs shot outsiede off and Cummins swats it powerfully through backward point, won't quite go all the way - but it brings up the Australia 600. You don't see too many of those;
168.6;?;Broad to Paine, no run whoosh, past the bat again, just a soupcon of nip off the surface this time as Paine closes the face;
168.5;?;Broad to Paine, no run angled in and tapped back towards mid-on;
168.4;4;Broad to Paine, FOUR runs pitched up, finds the outside edge... but it flies through vacant first slip for four! Another despairing dive from Bairstow, genuine thick edge but Cook is stood wide and neither was getting close to it;
168.3;4lb;Broad to Paine, 4 leg byes leg side, this goes straight on and flies for byes... or did it touch the pad? No chance to the keeper, either way;
168.2;?;Broad to Paine, no run criminy, that's gone like legbreak! Hits the surface and pongos away from Paine as he plays tentatively forward -miles away from hitting it but no batsman wants to see that;

162.3;?;Anderson to Paine, no run good length at off stump, defended on the front foot;
162.2;?;Anderson to Paine, no run looks very plumb as Paine cops this in front of middle stump, just above the knee roll. It's been given. He's reviewed it. He has been batting well outside the crease. If anything saves him it'll be that. There's no edge...and it's missing! Big stride, helped by where he started this shot, helps him make that review straight away. This is swinging in and climbing over leg stump. Good review;

157.3;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run it's moving now. Full outswinger just outside off. Hardly any feet as he pokes this to mid-off;
157.2;?;Woakes to Cummins, no run beaten on the outside edge. Angled in at the corridor, draws the bat out and then zips past it;
157.1;1;Woakes to Paine, 1 run nearly another run out. At the non-striker's this time. Paine drops this length ball in the gully region and takes off. The fielder can't hit the stumps;
156.6;W;Anderson to Paine, OUT oh dear Starc has messed this one up. Paine's blinded - he's just taken a big inswinger on the pad as he's looked to flick. It's flown towards gully as England make the appeal. Starc's called for the run, then realised there's no chance. Paine's halfway down when he gets the call for no. A bit of an empty stare between the batsmen before Starc decides it'll be him who takes the fall. England have a mere walk to clip the stumps at the striker's end;Mitchell Starc run out (Vince) 1 (6m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33;
156.5;?;Anderson to Paine, no run full, swinging in at leg stump. Inside edge and onto the pad as his head falls over during the attempted flick;
156.4;1;Anderson to Starc, 1 run and it turns out that man is a catching fielder too. One that Starc almost finds. Lifts this length ball on the up, and it lands short;
156.3;?;Anderson to Starc, no run length at middle stump, bunted uppishly towards short midwicket;
156.2;?;Anderson to Starc, no run back of a length, slanted across off stump. Poked into the covers on the up;
156.1;W;Anderson to Smith, OUT another review. Smith is hit on the pad in front of middle, just like Marsh. There were a couple of sounds. Umpire's said not out...there's no bat on the replay. And ball tracking says that's hitting! Decision overturned. A good review from England. Anderson was unsure, because of the sounds I reckon. Smith was playing down the wrong line as this one straightened from a middle stump line. He was right back in the crease as he is wont to do. England hitting the right spots this morning. Smith's highest score will read 239. An epic ends;Steven Smith lbw b Anderson 239 (578m 399b 30x4 1x6) SR: 59.89;
155.6;?;Woakes to Paine, no run bouncer, too short. Lets it fly over his front shoulder;
155.5;?;Woakes to Paine, no run fuller, just outside off stump. Defended into the covers;
155.4;?;Woakes to Paine, no run good length, angled into the corridor. Defended on the front foot;
155.3;1;Woakes to Smith, 1 run back of a length, in at leg stump and climbing. Gets on top of it and dabs to fine leg;
155.2;4;Woakes to Smith, FOUR runs back of a length in the corridor, walks into it and is slightly cramped, but he gets right on top and taps it through the wide open gully area;
155.1;?;Woakes to Smith, no run length at off stump, defended on the back foot;
154.6;?;Anderson to Paine, no run hello! Whew! Looks like that one's lifted off a crack. Completely beats Paine who is set up solidly on the front foot with the full face of the bat pointing down the pitch, only to see it zip away from him like a legbreak;
154.5;?;Anderson to Paine, no run some shape for Anderson again. Tails away from off stump on a length, defended solidly on the front foot;
154.4;?;Anderson to Paine, no run full and in at leg stump, can't get bat on the attempted flick, cops it on the pad;
154.3;1;Anderson to Smith, 1 run full and into the pads, clipped from the crease. Moeen Ali gets down quickly at square leg this time, to his left, and keeps it to one;
154.2;?;Anderson to Smith, no run length at middle stump, defended down the pitch;
154.1;4;Anderson to Smith, FOUR runs here we go. The first Smith flick of the day. A length ball, angled into the pads. Stands tall, whips it past square leg who is a tad slow getting down to his left. Deep midwicket fetches from the boundary;
153.6;?;Woakes to Paine, no run bouncer angled down leg side, gets under it comfortably as he ducks;
153.5;?;Woakes to Paine, no run back of a length at off stump, defended on the back foot;

152.6;?;Anderson to Smith, no run back of a length at middle stump, defended on the back foot;
152.5;?;Anderson to Smith, no run length and in at off stump, defended own the pitch;
152.4;1;Anderson to Paine, 1 run nicely pushed wide of mid-off. Bit of movement away from Anderson, at a full length outside off. Paine leans into it for his first run;
152.3;?;Anderson to Paine, no run back of a length and in the channel, defended away from the body, into the pitch off the inside half;
152.2;W;Anderson to Marsh, OUT it looks like Anderson has trapped him right in front of middle stump. It's been given. It's also been reviewed. Slightly fuller length ball from the last one, nips back in a touch. Marsh sitting on the back foot and he's beaten on the inside edge. The reviews shows no edge...and tracking tells us that's clipping the top of the stumps for what will remain an umpire's call and that is an abrupt end to Marsh's innings;Mitchell Marsh lbw b Anderson 181 (322m 236b 29x4 0x6) SR: 76.69;
152.1;?;Anderson to Marsh, no run straight one to start off, at a length. Defended comfortably on the back foot;

151.3;?;Woakes to Marsh, no run tight line and length, a slower ball from Woakes, Watched all the way onto the bat;
151.2;1;Woakes to Smith, 1 run on the hip, tucked fine, and there is the 300-run stand! Stunning application, and oodles more to come tomorrow, you suspect...;
151.1;?;Woakes to Smith, no run stretching forward, blocked to the off side;
150.6;1;Ali to Smith, 1 run a further exchange of singles, and there's one over to go;

145.1;?;Malan to Smith, no run pops up off the deck, back towards the bowler, and just short! A momentary lapse from Smith, but one that will surely redouble his concentration...;
144.6;4;Broad to Marsh, FOUR runs whipped with authority out through the leg side, a tired half-volley, and England's suffering shows no sign of abating;
144.5;?;Broad to Marsh, no run driven on the up, into the covers;
