6.10pm Innings break Brilliant performance from Pandya and Jadeja. Hardik Pandya on the flying mic: "We were expecting to score 260-270 but we always say when you try to score 60-70 you can end up getting 90. We kept our plans pretty simple and aimed for 60-65 and because of the shots we have we were able to get the extra 20-25." He got asked if he would bowl again today, he said "that's not going to happen" with a smile.
It was the third-best 6th wicket partnership for India in ODI cricket .
They have given India something to defend here albeit it is still 40 short of the average first innings score at this ground.
Karthik will be back for the start of the chase with Australia's new opening pair of Aaron Finch and Marnus Labuschagne.
Eric: "After the IPL my mouth was watering at the prospect of Hardik and Jadeja finishing an innings together and they have not disappointed. Seriously impressed with Pandya at number 6, he must bat in the top 5 in the T20Is."
Muzzammil: "How fit are these guys really. Been playing for more than an hour and still comfortable enough to take 8 doubles in last two overs alone. Wow!"

34.3;1;Agar to Hardik, 1 run back of a length on off stump, gets across to work it square on the leg side;

33.5;?;Hazlewood to Hardik, no run ooh, a yorker out of the blue. Not sure Pandya expected it, and he seemed late on his attempted defensive jab. The ball sneaks under and doesn't miss off stump by much;
33.4;?;Hazlewood to Hardik, no run shortish, close to off stump. Relentless with that line and length. Gets on his toes to ride the bounce and defend with soft hands, drops the ball close to his feet;

31.6;W;Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT ooh, Australia have reviewed for a caught-behind! Back of a length, straightening just a touch in the corridor. Kohli is looking initially to work this with the angle, I think, and then he's adjusting to the movement when the ball zips past his outside edge. Or has it kissed his edge? There's the tiniest of spikes on Ultra-Edge, but it's enough of a spike to reverse the on-field decision and send Kohli back. What a massive strike from Hazlewood!;Virat Kohli c ?Carey b Hazlewood 63 (78b 5x4 0x6) SR: 80.76;;
31.5;?;Hazlewood to Kohli, no run edged. Looks to step out and Hazlewood responds by bowling slightly shorter and wider. Knuckleball too. Looks to punch it away through the covers and ends up top-edging it, but it bounces well short of reaching the keeper;

28.3;1;Zampa to Kohli, 1 run a bit of flight outside off, stretches out and pushes into the cover point region;
28.2;4;Zampa to Kohli, FOUR runs Finally, a boundary. Short, just a touch of width, and Kohli goes deep and cuts it away to beat backward point to his right. First one since the 20th over;
28.1;?;Zampa to Kohli, no run length ball outside off, dabbed to short third man;
27.6;?;Agar to Hardik, no run flat, leg-stumpish, clipped to backward square leg;
27.5;1;Agar to Kohli, 1 run tossed up on middle stump, and Kohli brings up his 60th ODI fifty with a drive to long-off. He's barely reacted to the landmark, and you can see why, with India in the situation they're in;

25.4;?;Agar to Hardik, no run back of a length on the stumps, defended to straight midwicket;
25.3;W;Agar to Rahul, OUT gone, that's not a good shot at all. It's quite full, it's on the stumps, and it's hugely risky to try and sweep those balls. This one passes under his bat, and he's been given out lbw. He's reviewed... Only bounce can save him, I think. No bat on it. Big stride forward, so that might help. Nope. It's hitting the top part of middle stump, so he'll have to be on his way. India lose a review too. Really poor choice of shot, I think;KL Rahul lbw b Agar 5 (11b 0x4 0x6) SR: 45.45;;

24.2;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run a bit of flight and he skips out, driven straight to short extra-cover;
24.1;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run nice length close to off stump, may have been the wrong'un. Good stride out to defend into the off side;

22.4;W;Zampa to Iyer, OUT gone! Iyer was looking to force the pace there, trying to reverse some of the momentum Australia have built with these quiet overs. Full and quickish, on the stumps, and Iyer looks to make room to drive through - or maybe over - the covers. Ends up a little more leg-side of the ball than he wants, and the ball turns and he slices it into backward point's hands;Shreyas Iyer c Labuschagne b Zampa 19 (21b 2x4 0x6) SR: 90.47;;

Here we go.
2.28pm The players are head out to the middle. Hazlewood will open the bowling for Australia. Dhawan and Gill follow them out. Dhawan will be on strike for the first ball.
Australia: 1 Aaron Finch (capt), 2 Marnus Labuschagne, 3 Steven Smith, 4 Cameron Green, 5 Moises Henriques, 6 Alex Carey (wk), 7 Glenn Maxwell, 8 Ashton Agar, 9 Sean Abbott, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood.
India: 1 Shikhar Dhawan, 2 Shubman Gill, 3 Virat Kohli (capt), 4 Shreyas Iyer, 5 KL Rahul (wk), 6 Hardik Pandya, 7 Ravindra Jadeja, 8 Shardul Thakur, 9 Kuldeep Yadav, 10 Jasprit Bumrah, 11 T Natarajan.
2.35pm Thank Karthik. Exciting to see a few new faces today on both sides.
Bails: "Fascinated to see if Green gets the new ball for Aus ahead of Abbott. Unlikely to bowl his full 10 either way." I think it will be Abbott and Hazlewood first up Bails but you never know.
Akhilesh: "In India's long ODI history, T Natarajan is just the 11th left-arm seamer!"
vaibhav goyal: "I feel for Agarwal.He has a proven domestic and india A record. Some people are given long runs and other are deprived of confidence by too much chopping. Work in his temperament and innings approach rather."
2.30pm So much to look forward to today. Debutants and plenty of other newish faces, bright sunshine, and I'm sure 100 enthralling overs. Alex Malcolm will bring you the opening exchanges as I go and get myself a snack.
Cameron: "Out of the four players after Jadeja, can any of them bat?" - Shardul Thakur is a pretty good No. 8. Kuldeep Yadav has a first-class hundred, but I'm not sure he has the power game for white-ball cricket.
Pugal: "Feel bad for Manish Pandey. Played so well when India toured Australia last time. This is what happens when you are not flexible in your batting position. Lose your batting position first and eventually dropped from the team."
Khan: "I strongly feel Agarwal and shami are rested rather than dropped. They are both important for four Test matches. You can argue about Bumrah but one of Shami and Bumrah has to play today to lead the pack."
Megh: "I feel for Saini. I felt his spells were improving and was in the cusp of a breakthrough. Understand they needed to try out Natarajan, but that could happen by resting Bumrah"
Shikhar Dhawan: "We have been batting well. We just have to convert those 30s and 40s into big ones. Very happy with my batting form, enjoying timing the ball well. Wickets have been good to bat on."
Varun: "Gill won't get any better opportunity than this..opening the innings in a batting paradise..no Cummins and Starc in opposition..no pressure to score af faster pace since dhawan is there at the other end to provide aggressive starts..hope gill will realise all the potentials into results today.."
Balasubramanian: "From Chinnappampatti to Canberra Natarajan story is really inspiring. "
Dhaval : "I am not in favor of giving reserves an opportunity for and judge them just for 1 match. If you really want to test a player, you have to give them a longer run. I feel Natarajan should have been our third seamer in all the matches and T20s as well. He has good death bowling skills which could have allowed to use Bumrah early."
2.10pm Well, well. India have won a toss! They'll bat first. "Looks like a really, really good wicket to bat on," says Virat Kohli. He says India "haven't tried enough things with the ball" so far in the series.
India have really rung in the changes. Apart from Natarajan, Shubman Gill, Shardul Thakur and Kuldeep Yadav have also come into the side. Mayank Agarwal, Navdeep Saini, Mohammed Shami and Yuzvendra Chahal sit out.
Three changes for Australia. Back niggle for Starc, Aaron Finch says. Green, Abbott and Ashton Agar are in for Warner, Cummins and Starc. "Myself and Marnus will be opening."
Both teams have added depth to their batting - Australia in particular, with Agar and Abbott at 8 and 9. I feel for Agarwal, who made bright starts in both games, and might have deserved another chance to show he can get in and bat big.
2.05pm Steven Smith presented Cam Green his ODI cap. Big moment for the young batting allrounder. It also looks like T Natarajan has got his ODI cap. Wow. What a ride it has been for the left-arm quick.
Some pictures of the pitch coming in too - a few cracks around, but they're widely spaced-out, and it looks like they'll need to open up a lot more (it probably won't happen over the course of 100 overs) to have a major impact.
Sarthak: "Daniel Sams/Ashton Agar are a perfect replacement for Starc while Sean Abott is a perfect replacement for Cummins. Very Strong Australia, having alternatives for all players!! Matthew Wade can also come in for Alex Carey too." -- Not having Cummins + Starc will definitely test Australia, especially if conditions are as batting-friendly as we expect.
Karen: "Oh, and those weren't thundershowers. It was more like a thunder-rain-slap. I was driving and my car was being pushed around by the wind. Crazy hour!"
Mustafa Moudi : "India has lost their last 7 International Games on a bounce. Havent recently seen the Indian Team in a Situation worse than . Anything can happen in 2020 !!"
Saleque Sufi: "India is missing Rohit , a competent third seamer and Dhoni like finisher . Three positions matter in the fight among top dogs."
Savad: "Even though Mayank's performance wasn't that bad, India should replace him with Pandey/Gill letting Rahul/Gill to pen with Dhawan. Some times staying at crease will have more impact than quick fire 25-35 odd runs."
1.50pm Cameron Green is set for an ODI debut. He's just received his cap. Mitchell Starc, meanwhile, looks set to miss out. We're hearing whispers of a back/side issue.
India could make some changes today too. There are a few debates floating around their bowling attack. Gautam Gambhir wants them to play Shardul Thakur and leave Navdeep Saini out for the rest of the white-ball leg of the tour. There's also the question of whether Kuldeep Yadav comes in for Yuzvendra Chahal. What do you think?
Karen: "As a Canberran (very jealous of anyone going as I have to work), I can tell you, there's a great chance of a 400+ total if Australia bats first today. Great weather conditions, light cloud, warm, light breeze...but watch out for the moths later!"
Saleque Sufi: "Flat wicket , toss will matter . Toss and bat can make team winning score around 370 -380. I would suggest playing Cameroon Green letting Labuschagne open with Finch." -- From Finch's pre-match quotes, it seems like Australia might not want to upset their middle-order combination.
Amar: "India has recently failed to give reserves an opportunity in such dead rubbers hope it's not the case today. Make as many changes as possible cuz nothing can replace intl experience."
Gavin Bruhn: "They are playing a full-strength Australian team this time." -- India weren't at full strength in 2018-19 either. They rested Bumrah for the ODI series and didn't have Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul, who was suspended.
SYED IBRAHIM: "I would love to see Siraj playing in place of Saini. Also there has to be an additional batsman. Anyhow it's gonna be a run fiest." -- Siraj isn't part of the ODI squad, officially, but neither was Bumrah before he made his debut in 2016, so you never know...
1.40pm Afternoon, everyone. India came into this tour having won three of their last four ODIs against Australia in Australia, but this tour has reminded them of exactly how difficult a country this is to visit. Australia have already wrapped up the ODI series, and 3-0 is very much on the cards if India can't find a way to add some teeth to their bowling, especially since conditions at the Manuka Oval are expected to be as batting-friendly as - if not more than - they were at the SCG. This might be a dead rubber, but there's still plenty to play for, so strap in and stay with us through the ride.
We're hearing there were thundershowers in Canberra yesterday, but today has dawned bright and dry. There's just under half an hour to go for the toss, so it's a good time to have a quick glance at our preview.
 Innings Start
10.46pm Right then, that's all from us from this ODI series. We hope you've enjoyed it as much as we did. The T20Is will begin soon, and there's a whole lot of other cricket going on around the world right now too (I wonder if this would have seemed possible six months ago), so keep tuning into our coverage, and keep sending in your comments. Until next time, goodbye!
Nilay: "This game was really good from the perspective that we have T20 series now; good middle over wickets, great death bowling, Bumrah getting vack in the froove(excellent for the Tests too), and also Pandya Power. The series would be good one to look forward for."
Varun Gande: "The curse of the Jadeja fifty is finally broken: India had previously never won an ODI when Jadeja passed 50."
Pizza: "Unpopular opinion but, the toss needs to be scrapped. In a series where both teams consistently scored 300+, and both teams winning every time they won the toss, it's hard to pinpoint who is the better team. Either that, or we need more matches, like a 5-match ODI series to be able to tell " -- I don't think the toss makes this much of a difference normally, so this feels like one of those anomalous series that crop up from time to time.
Aaron Finch: "We fought really well today, just fell a little short. Obviously great partnership between Hardik and Jadeja, we might have been in a good position if we'd nabbed one of them early. I thought Cameron Green came in and made an impact with ball and bat, and showed he belongs at the international level. Ashton Agar played well too, so it was good to get them in and get some information on them. Makes the 50 overs go a little quicker [with two spinners] and the impact they've had is quite important too. That's been our recipe in T20 for a while now. It's nice when guys in the top order have really good contributions, and then Maxy can come in and do his thing in the back end. I thought Alex Carey, Moises, these guys did well too. Hopefully [Starc] is back for the T20s. Just a niggly thing with the back."
Virat Kohli: "It's particularly pleasing that we were under the pump for the first half of our innings, and second half of Australia's, and we fought back both times. One guy making his debut, Shubman coming back, that brought us some freshness. I think the pitch was much better in terms of helping the bowlers, so obviously the confidence levels go up. We were able to put Australia under pressure because of that fact as well. Playing international cricket for 13-14 years, you should be able to come back like we did. I would have liked to go on for a bit longer, but we had a great partnership between Hardik and Jadeja. It was exactly what the team needed to get that boost, even though we've lost the series. We played with heart and desire, and that's what you need to do in Australia."
Steven Smith, Player of the Series: "The pitch did a bit more with the new ball. Both quicks bowled really well up front from both teams, so probably a little bit different to the SCG. Hopefully a day off [tomorrow] and then come over here just before the [first T20I], that would be ideal."
Hardik Pandya is the Player of the Match. "It's fantastic. Been working really hard to make sure I play for my country, so I'm really happy to be playing this series. Natarajan is quite a story, quite an inspiration with the background he's come from. You need to be on your toes to compete against Australia. I feel that you always have that extra edge in you when you play against Australia, you want to face up to that challenge."
"I'm fine if Jadeja keeps that role," he adds, when Shane Warne asks him if he's taken away the Rockstar mantle. "I'm a father now."
Dhaval Shah: "Now that we have won this match, I would like to still point out a major setback we have in our batting line-up and batting approach. I feel we need players like Pant and Pandya to match the approach by teams like England and Australia. Pandya has proved today as well. But Pant is as important in the batting line-up. He should be developed and groomed and given a longer run."
Arun: "Can we just point out that just a little bit of life in the pitch made the game so more interesting"
Prasanna S: "Not to take any credit away from Australia but the win equation is = number of tosses won and team batting first. Had India won one of the tosses, it could have gone either way, they managed 300+ in all the games."
Prasad: "It's inaccurate and unfair to say Thakur did a Plunkett impression. Not being jingoistic or anything, but more than player be an exponent of something. Cross-seam bowlers should be thought of as a subset, much like the holding midfielder subset." -- Yup, yup. It was just a comment on how effectively he used the weapon.
10.28pm A dead rubber, but they're often really entertaining. Today's game had so much packed into it, and in the end, the most significant bit of the action was an outstanding sixth-wicket partnership between Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja, which hauled India past 300. There was just enough in this pitch to interest the bowlers, contrary to the ground's ODI history, and India made good use of it to put up their most convincing bowling display of the series. Shardul Thakur did his best Liam Plunkett impression with his cross-seam smarts, and Jasprit Bumrah bowled excellently and could have had a lot more wickets on another day. An encouraging debut for T Natarajan as well, despite getting carted around briefly by Glenn Maxwell.
Maxwell could, and possibly should, have won this game for Australia, but he made a significant contribution for the third successive innings, and he's put that horror IPL far, far behind him. I thought Agar and Zampa bowled really well for Australia too.
49.3;W;Bumrah to Zampa, OUT big appeal for lbw, given. Zampa shuffles across and Bumrah bowls it full and straight. He misses the flick, and it looked pretty plumb, given especially how deep he was in his crease, but Zampa has reviewed anyway. No edge on it. Both feet inside the crease, and it's smashing into leg stump, so India have wrapped up a victory that will bring them quite a bit of comfort, after five successive ODI losses, and seven in a row across formats.;Adam Zampa lbw b Bumrah 4 (7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 57.14;
49.2;?;Bumrah to Zampa, no run slower ball, short and wide outside off. Digs into the pitch and turns like an offbreak. Swings too early into the pull, and then the ball turns and rolls down to Rahul;
49.1;1;Bumrah to Hazlewood, 1 run leg-stump yorker, almost. Very low full-toss, and he makes room and stabs it towards backward point;
48.6;1;Thakur to Hazlewood, 1 run length ball outside off, slapped to deep point;
48.5;1;Thakur to Zampa, 1 run low full-toss on leg stump, knuckleball too. Zampa makes room, adjusts for the lack of pace, and jabs it past the bowler, down towards long-off;
48.4;1;Thakur to Hazlewood, 1 run shot. Full again, on leg stump, clears his front leg and swipes it down to long-on;
48.3;2;Thakur to Hazlewood, 2 runs in the blockhole on off stump, makes room and drives to the left of Kohli at deep point;
48.2;1;Thakur to Zampa, 1 run full outside off, carved to deep point;
48.1;?;Thakur to Zampa, no run yorker outside off, and Zampa looks to reverse-ramp and fails to make contact;
47.6;1;Natarajan to Zampa, 1 run full on off stump, clipped to deep square leg;
47.5;1;Natarajan to Hazlewood, 1 run in the blockhole, angling into leg stump. Makes room and squeezes it out to backward point;
47.4;?;Natarajan to Hazlewood, no run bouncer, over middle and off. Looks to make room and ramp it over the keeper, makes no contact;
47.3;1;Natarajan to Zampa, 1 run shortish, slanting across the right-hander. Jabbed into the point region;
47.2;1;Natarajan to Hazlewood, 1 run in the blockhole on off stump, clipped into the midwicket region;
47.1;W;Natarajan to Agar, OUT and he gets the last recognised batsman! Boundaries were needed, and this ball - more or less in the slot, off-stumpish - had to be attacked. Made room to go over cover, but he simply couldn't find the elevation, and the fielder pouches it with both hands in front of his chest;Ashton Agar c Kuldeep Yadav b Natarajan 28 (28b 2x4 0x6) SR: 100;
46.6;W;Thakur to Abbott, OUT slower bouncer, and Thakur has the breakthrough. Third wicket for him. Gets up just around shoulder height, angling in and cramping Abbott for room, and he plays a half-hearted pull, only managing to lob it to the keeper off his glove. India's quicks have really pulled this back in the last three overs;Sean Abbott c ?Rahul b Thakur 4 (9b 0x4 0x6) SR: 44.44;
46.5;?;Thakur to Abbott, no run leg-stump yorker, misses the flick and prompts an lbw appeal. Probably sliding down leg;
46.4;1;Thakur to Agar, 1 run shortish, slanting away from the left-hander, slashed to third man;
46.3;1;Thakur to Abbott, 1 run slower ball on off stump, clipped to long-on;
46.2;1;Thakur to Agar, 1 run looks for the wide yorker, ends up bowling a wide, reasonably high full-toss. Steered down to third man;
46.1;1;Thakur to Abbott, 1 run slower length ball on off stump, clipped towards deep midwicket;
45.6;2;Natarajan to Agar, 2 runs good ball. Agar looks to make room and carve through the off side. Natarajan's low full-toss doesn't give him the length to work with, and he ends up dragging it down towards long-on. Just four off the over, so an excellent comeback, albeit with Maxwell out of the picture;
45.5;1;Natarajan to Abbott, 1 run full on leg stump, driven to long-on. Natarajan may have got a foot to it to slow it down, after which he slipped and landed awkwardly, almost twisting his right ankle. He's fine, though;
45.4;?;Natarajan to Abbott, no run length ball on off stump. No feet from Abbott, just pushes at it and slices it towards backward point;
45.3;?;Natarajan to Abbott, no run nearly a yorker again, pitches just outside leg, beats the flick and hits him on the pad;
45.2;?;Natarajan to Abbott, no run in the blockhole, clipped straight back to the bowler;
45.1;1;Natarajan to Agar, 1 run low full-toss on off stump, jabbed down the ground to long-off;
44.6;1;Bumrah to Agar, 1 run in the blockhole close to off stump, stabbed into the point region with an open face;
44.5;?;Bumrah to Agar, no run shortish, close to off stump. Hops to ride the bounce and defend it;
44.4;1;Bumrah to Abbott, 1 run fullish on off stump, steps across and clips it to deep backward square leg;
44.3;W;Bumrah to Maxwell, OUT bam, the bails go flying all over the place. That elastic right arm goes beyond the vertical and whangs it full and fast, at the base of the stumps. Maxwell looks to make room and carve it through the covers, working against the angle. He misses, and Bumrah - who's bowled so well with no luck all this while - hits. A crucial, crucial blow;Glenn Maxwell b Bumrah 59 (38b 3x4 4x6) SR: 155.26;;
44.3;1w;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to follow up with the leg-stump yorker, and he misses his mark by inches. Maxwell looked to step across and help it fine, and couldn't put bat to it;
44.3;1w;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide slower bouncer again, over off stump, and Maxwell thinks of playing the ramp to third man, then decides to leave it. It's called wide anyway;
44.2;1;Bumrah to Agar, 1 run short outside off, slapped to deep point;
44.1;1;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run slower bouncer outside off, Maxwell tennis-forehands it down the ground to long-on;
43.6;1;Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run length ball outside off, opens his bat face and steers to deep point;
43.6;1w;Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to go wide and outside Maxwell's hitting arc, slanting it away from him from over the wicket. It's hard to control the line while doing that, and Maxwell shoulders arms as the ball crosses the tramline;
43.5;1;Natarajan to Agar, 1 run goes for the leg-stump yorker now, and Agar makes himself room and drives to long-off;
43.4;4;Natarajan to Agar, FOUR runs shortish outside off, and now Agar joins in the fun. Not bowling to his field, is Natarajan. Cuts it to the left of backward point, and the sweeper is well in front of square, so no way is he getting to that;
43.3;1;Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run goes a bit wider with the yorker, and Maxwell collapses his back knee to get down low and steer it to deep backward point;
43.2;4;Natarajan to Maxwell, FOUR runs low full-toss on off stump, and Maxwell's eased it for four, just a push between mid-off and extra-cover;
43.1;6;Natarajan to Maxwell, SIX runs goes for the yorker, and Maxwell was expecting that, sitting quite deep in his crease on off stump. Simply brings those wrists into play and whips it over the midwicket boundary to bring up another superlative half-century;
42.6;1;Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run full on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket;
42.5;1;Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run tossed up on off stump, clipped to long-on;
42.4;1;Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run fuller and flatter, whipped to long-on;
42.3;6;Kuldeep to Maxwell, SIX runs what. A. Shot. Maxwell hits more reverse-sweeps for six than pretty much everyone else, and this time he had to manufacture even more power given that Kuldeep dangled it up slow, and it also landed a little shorter than you might think is ideal for that shot. No worries, says Maxwell, I'll just whack that into the second tier, in front of square;
42.2;1;Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run tossed up close to off stump, whipped down to long-on;
42.1;2;Kuldeep to Agar, 2 runs shortish outside off, slapped to deep point;
41.6;?;Bumrah to Maxwell, no run slower bouncer over off stump, and Maxwell picked it late. Was looking to hook, initially, then he pulled out and semi-ducked to get himself under it;
41.5;1;Bumrah to Agar, 1 run looks for the yorker, ends up bowling a low full-toss on off stump, clipped towards midwicket, who moves quickly to his right to stop it but lets the ball get away from him slightly;
41.4;?;Bumrah to Agar, no run slower ball, fullish on leg stump. Clipped to midwicket;
41.3;1;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run full-toss, about thigh-high, on the stumps. Steps across and whips it to fine leg;
41.2;?;Bumrah to Maxwell, no run low full-toss close to off stump. Punched back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat. Was probably aiming to go through cover;
41.2;1w;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide big wide down the leg side. Wanted to angle it into his feet and deny him room;
41.1;1;Bumrah to Agar, 1 run on the pads, nudged into the square leg region;
40.6;1;Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run back of a length fairly wide of off stump. Agar doesn't pick the wrong'un. He was shaping to slap it through point, maybe, and ends up playing a hurried flick to long-on;
40.5;1;Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 run tossed up on leg stump, Maxwell brings out the reverse-sweep but can't beat deep point;
40.4;?;Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run full on off stump, driven to short cover;
40.3;?;Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run tossed up on middle stump. Doesn't get a stride in, ends up stuck in the crease. Flicked to midwicket;
40.2;?;Kuldeep to Maxwell, no run very full, quicker ball in the blockhole on off stump, jabbed to short cover;
40.1;1;Kuldeep to Agar, 1 run shortish outside off, slapped to deep point;
39.6;4;Natarajan to Maxwell, FOUR runs back of a length outside off, and Maxwell puts it away. Lets it come on and jabs it between backward point and short third man. A difficult field to bowl to against a set batsman;
39.5;1;Natarajan to Agar, 1 run length ball on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket;
39.4;4;Natarajan to Agar, FOUR runs there's the Natarajan yorker. Homing in on Agar's front toe, and he looks to jam down on it and gets the tiniest of inside edges that sends the ball scooting past leg stump for four;
39.3;3;Natarajan to Maxwell, 3 runs fullish, angling into off stump from round the wicket. Opens his bat face and steers it a long way to the left of the cover sweeper. Excellent placement;
39.2;1;Natarajan to Agar, 1 run length ball outside off, makes a bit of room to drive to deep cover;
39.1;1;Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run shortish, angling into off stump, pulled to deep square leg;
38.6;1;Thakur to Maxwell, 1 run length ball close to off stump, punched with an open face through point;
38.5;1;Thakur to Agar, 1 run fullish, angling across, pushed towards mid-off for the quick single;
38.4;?;Thakur to Agar, no run length ball close to off stump. Not wide or short enough to cut, and he ends up chopping it hard into the pitch;
38.3;?;Thakur to Agar, no run length ball on leg stump, clipped to midwicket;
38.2;?;Thakur to Agar, no run length ball angling across, looks to drive with an angled bat and inside-edges into his front pad;
38.1;?;Thakur to Agar, no run back of a length at the hip, clipped to midwicket;
37.6;1;Jadeja to Agar, 1 run full again, almost in the blockhole. Clipped past the diving bowler, down to long-on;
37.5;?;Jadeja to Agar, no run full on middle stump, clipped back to the bowler;
37.4;W;Jadeja to Carey, OUT gone, is he? That run wasn't on at all. They've gone up to the third umpire, but you'd think there's no need. Carey looked to sweep one pitching just outside leg, and missed, and the ball rolled into the square leg region. Carey sets off quickly, and he's sent back by Maxwell, but too late to beat the underarm throw to Rahul. Kohli was the fielder sprinting in from midwicket;Alex Carey run out (Kohli/?Rahul) 38 (42b 4x4 0x6) SR: 90.47;
37.3;?;Jadeja to Carey, no run sees Carey stepping away to make room and follows him with a quick, full one. Pushed down to mid-off;
37.2;1;Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run full outside off, driven with a lot of bottom hand down to long-off;
37.1;4;Jadeja to Maxwell, FOUR runs tossed up wide of off, and Maxwell doesn't miss out this time. Lofted over extra-cover, and he finds the gap to the right of deep cover;
36.6;1;Thakur to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length outside off, punched to deep point;
36.5;1;Thakur to Carey, 1 run full on off stump, punched down the ground, past the stumps and to the left of mid-off;
36.4;1;Thakur to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length outside off, dabbed down to third man;
36.3;3;Thakur to Carey, 3 runs back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to the left of deep square leg, where Kuldeep looks up too early and fluffs his pick-up. Has to run back and ensure he doesn't concede a boundary;
36.2;1;Thakur to Maxwell, 1 run length ball on middle stump, shows the full face to push down to long-on;
36.1;1lb;Thakur to Carey, 1 leg bye length ball, looks to work it into the leg side and misses. Aborted lbw appeal because it pitched outside leg;
35.6;?;Jadeja to Maxwell, no run and again, beats him with sharp turn from that wide line. Maxwell goes hard at the attempted flat-bat drive and misses;
35.5;?;Jadeja to Maxwell, no run that's the line. Slower, wide line outside off, makes Maxwell reach out to drive and the ball turns to beat the outside edge;
35.4;6;Jadeja to Maxwell, SIX runs back of a length on off stump, and Maxwell's hit this one out of the park too. Quick feet to get on the back foot with hips open, and even quicker hands to pull it waay over midwicket. It's landed on the stadium roof and rolled off the premises altogether;
35.3;6;Jadeja to Maxwell, SIX runs bang. The open stance allows him easier access to this sort of line. Length ball, angling into middle stump or so, and he gets forward, head over the ball, and absolutely shovels it over the midwicket boundary with super quick hands;
35.2;1;Jadeja to Carey, 1 run length ball on middle stump, brings out the reverse-sweep in front of deep square leg;
35.1;1;Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run nicely played. That's fired in fairly full on middle and leg, and he makes himself room for an inside-out chip to the right of deep cover;
34.6;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run length ball on off stump, defended into the covers;
34.5;4;Bumrah to Carey, FOUR runs short, gets it to climb towards Carey's shoulder, but he's controlled his pull beautifully, swivels and simply helps it to the right of the long leg fielder, ensuring he keeps it down;
34.4;1;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run back of a length outside off, punched to deep point;
34.4;1w;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide short, angling down leg. Looks to pull and misses. Wanted to bowl the bouncer at his front shoulder, I guess, and missed his line marginally;
34.3;?;Bumrah to Maxwell, no run back of a length on off stump, whipped to midwicket with a twirl of the wrists;

32.5;?;Bumrah to Carey, no run good length zipping in, hits the back thigh guard;
32.4;2;Bumrah to Carey, 2 runs off the glove and just over Rahul! Only 136kph apparently, it looked like 146kph, too quick for Carey, bounced off his gloves and over Rahul;
32.3;1;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run 137kph, short ball, only gets up chest high, he takes his eyes of it but pulls to fine leg without trouble;
32.3;1w;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide 138kph angled down leg and it's called wide! They appealed for caught behind. It certainly looked like it came off the thigh guard;
32.2;1;Bumrah to Carey, 1 run 137kph, back of a length wide of off, he gets a thick inside edge that runs past leg stump! A touch fortunate there Carey;
32.1;1;Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run 132kph, back of a length on off, he stays leg side and defends to cover-point for a single;

20.6;1;Thakur to Finch, 1 run angled into the hip, he glances this with ease to fine leg;
20.5;4;Thakur to Finch, FOUR runs pulled forward of square! Iyer gets there on the rope at full stretch to his left but it rolls off his hand into the rope. Too short from Thakur, chest high and Finch was all over it slapping it forward of square;
20.4;1;Thakur to Henriques, 1 run 139kph, full on leg, he clips this to midwicket's right, Kohli dives to his right to knock it down but can't reel it in to get a throw off;
20.3;4;Thakur to Henriques, FOUR runs pulled powerfully between midwicket and mid off! Fractionally short outside off, he was so quick to spot the length, rocked back and smoked it;
20.2;1;Thakur to Finch, 1 run 139kph, shorter length, chest high, he swivels and pulls to wide fine leg;
20.1;2;Thakur to Finch, 2 runs 139kph, back of a length, Finch is on the walk and works this just midwicket and they pinch two. Outrageous running to pinch two there;
19.6;?;Jadeja to Henriques, no run 95kph, shorter, darted into leg, it takes him on the thigh pad;
19.5;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run shorter length, he's back and tucking this forward of square;
19.4;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run spins sharply past the edge. Ripping delivery. Drifted in and gripped away past the edge;
19.3;1;Jadeja to Henriques, 1 run shorter, darted into leg, he's back and pulling to deep square;
19.2;?;Jadeja to Henriques, no run 91kph, tossed up outside off, he slices a drive to backward point;
19.1;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run shorter outside off, he's back and cutting to point;
18.6;1;Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run full on leg, he sweeps but it comes off the toe of the bat and runs forward of square;
18.5;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run shorter length, he gives room and drives forcefully off the back foot to cover-point;
18.4;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run tossed higher, 79kph, he drives firmly back to the bowler;
18.3;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run wrong un, 78kph, pitching on off, Finch has to adjust late to defend;
18.2;1;Kuldeep to Henriques, 1 run shorter length, spinning back into leg, he gets deep in the crease to work it to fine leg with the spin;
18.1;?;Kuldeep to Henriques, no run tossed up on middle, he defends from the crease;
17.6;1;Jadeja to Henriques, 1 run shorter length, he stands tall and drives to long on;
17.5;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run gets away with a top edge! Short ball, he got a top edge and it balloons high in the air but lands safe between short fine running back and deep square coming in;
17.4;6;Jadeja to Finch, SIX runs a slog sweep over backward square! What a shot to bring up another half-century!. Outside off and he hammers this over the man on the rope!;
17.3;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run 90kph, darted into off, Finch defends;
17.2;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run 93kph, this holds up in the surface, he pushes back to the bowler;
17.1;2;Jadeja to Finch, 2 runs darted down leg, he tries to sweeps and gloves it over the keeper's head and it runs away for two;
16.6;1;Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run tossed up outside off, gets forward and blocks into the off side;
16.5;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run down the track and again he's not to the pitch. Clipped to midwicket;
16.4;2;Kuldeep to Finch, 2 runs down the track now and the ball lands just short of where he wants it, but he goes through with his big shot anyway. Doesn't middle it, and it lands a few feet short of the rope as long-on sprints to his left;
16.3;4;Kuldeep to Finch, FOUR runs quickish again, and Finch quickly picks the line, which is outside leg, and uses the pace to sweep it firmly to the right of the deep backward square leg fielder;
16.2;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run down the track and he goes too early. Kuldeep spots him and bowls it shorter and quicker. Ends up deliberately padding it away. Was in no danger of hitting the stumps from left-arm over, of course;
16.1;2;Kuldeep to Finch, 2 runs tossed up on middle and leg, gets forward and clips it away fine;
15.6;1;Jadeja to Finch, 1 run sweeps again, but can't beat the man at backward square leg;
15.5;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run flat slider going down leg. Looks to sweep and misses. Appeal for caught behind from Rahul, who's done well to move there and collect. Just brushed the flap of the pad;
15.4;?;Jadeja to Finch, no run length ball outside off, gets forward and blocks to short cover;
15.3;1;Jadeja to Henriques, 1 run back of a length on off stump, whipped to deep square leg;
15.2;?;Jadeja to Henriques, no run tossed up slow and wide, looks to step across and sweep. Through it too soon and he's hit on the back;
15.1;?;Jadeja to Henriques, no run back of a length, sliding on towards off stump, punched to extra-cover;
14.6;1;Kuldeep to Henriques, 1 run length ball, pitching on off stump and spinning further away. Waits on the back foot, watches it turn, and then punches to long-off. Clearly hanging back and looking to play it off the pitch, is Henriques. Kuldeep will want to find ways to bring him forward;
14.5;?;Kuldeep to Henriques, no run length ball spinning in towards off and middle, stays back and punches it back to the bowler;
14.4;2;Kuldeep to Henriques, 2 runs shortish, turning quickly down the leg side, whipped to deep square leg;
14.3;1;Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run down the track to another tossed-up ball on leg stump, flicks it away to deep midwicket;
14.2;1;Kuldeep to Henriques, 1 run flighted ball on middle stump, clipped to long-on;
14.1;1;Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run tossed up on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket;
13.6;?;Thakur to Henriques, no run ooh, some extra bounce here. Shortish, a bit of width, but the bounce defeats the attempted cut;
13.5;?;Thakur to Henriques, no run back of a length outside off, straightens slightly and maybe stops on Henriques. Defended into the covers;
13.4;?;Thakur to Henriques, no run length ball on off stump, clipped to mid-on;
13.3;?;Thakur to Henriques, no run shortish, a bit of width, cut away but can't beat backward point;
13.2;?;Thakur to Henriques, no run back of a length on off stump, uses his wrists to play that to mid-on off the back foot;
13.1;?;Thakur to Henriques, no run back of a length close to off stump, stabbed to the left of backward point, where Jadeja makes his customary diving save. Henriques took off for a single and then had to turn around hurriedly and throw himself into the crease. Direct hit may have been interesting. As it happens, he's called for a change of pads. Not sure what's gone wrong with his current pair;
12.6;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run beaten on the flick, not much of an lbw appeal because this was spinning down leg. A bit of flight and dip, and the ball beat the inside edge. Oh, hang on, India have reviewed! Kuldeep has bowled a better length through this over than he did in his first over, and Finch, who's got a big stride forward, simply fails to get to the pitch as he looks to flick. Turns sharply to hit his front pad, and it's turned too sharply. Missing leg stump is the verdict of ball-tracking;
12.5;1;Kuldeep to Henriques, 1 run back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to deep backward square leg;
12.4;1;Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run down the track now, gets close to this leg-stumpish ball and works it away through square leg;
12.3;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run goes back to a fairly full ball pitching on off stump, picks the direction of turn and clips to midwicket;
12.2;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run full, on the pads, clipped to square leg;
12.1;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run dips onto a good length on middle stump, clipped to midwicket;
11.6;?;Thakur to Henriques, no run length ball on off stump, punched to mid-off;
11.5;?;Thakur to Henriques, no run length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone;
11.4;4;Thakur to Henriques, FOUR runs back of a length, a bit of width, and Henriques stands tall and slaps it between backward point and cover point. What a start!;
11.3;4;Thakur to Henriques, FOUR runs angling down leg again, but no shuffle from Henriques. Just clips it away neatly to the fine leg boundary;
11.2;W;Thakur to Smith, OUT got him! No 62-ball hundred today for Smith. Not the most aesthetically pleasing dismissal, but Thakur won't care. Back of a length, angling down leg, and Smith, who's shuffled a long way across as he always does, looks to glance it fine but only manages to tickle it to the keeper. Tons of bowlers have tried getting him out like that, or with a leg gully in place, and they've usually failed;Steven Smith c ?Rahul b Thakur 7 (15b 0x4 0x6) SR: 46.66;
11.1;?;Thakur to Smith, no run full outside off, a bit of late outswing. Driven firmly to mid-off;
10.6;1;Kuldeep to Smith, 1 run short on leg stump, rocks back and swats a pull to deep backward square leg;
10.5;1;Kuldeep to Finch, 1 run back of a length, spins down leg slightly, goes back and works it to deep backward square leg;
10.4;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run down the track, and again he fails to reach the pitch of the ball. Wrong'un this time, past the other side of his flick to hit him on the body;
10.3;?;Kuldeep to Finch, no run down the track but he can't get to the pitch of this loopy one just outside leg stump. Looks to flick and the ball hits his front pad;
10.2;3;Kuldeep to Smith, 3 runs short, turns down leg, and Smith plays the old Tendulkar paddle sweep (pretty much a straight drive behind the wicket) past the keeper;
10.1;?;Kuldeep to Smith, no run tossed up slow on off stump, skips out and clips with the turn to short midwicket;
9.6;1;Thakur to Smith, 1 run fullish, angling into middle and off. Lets it come and clips to the right of midwicket;
9.5;1;Thakur to Finch, 1 run length ball close to off stump, gets forward for a push to the left of short extra;
9.4;?;Thakur to Finch, no run looks to step out again, and Thakur gets this one to nip back in slightly to beat the flick. Half-hearted appeal, the ball was probably heading down leg;
9.3;?;Thakur to Finch, no run down the track again, Thakur shortens his length slightly and Finch flat-bats to extra-cover;
9.2;?;Thakur to Finch, no run length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler;
9.1;4;Thakur to Finch, FOUR runs go on, just throw your bat at everything. Nothing's going to go to hand anyway. Down the track to a length ball that nips away off the pitch, and he drives with bat far out in front of his body. Thick edge, flies in the air to the right of backward point;
8.6;?;Bumrah to Smith, no run length ball outside off, left alone;
8.5;1;Bumrah to Finch, 1 run what a charmed life Finch is leading. Length ball angling into off stump, and this one bounces out of nowhere. Straightens slightly too. Looks to work it with the angle, and the ball pops up in the air, off the leading edge, but into no-man's land to the right of square leg;
8.4;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers;
8.3;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball, fourth-stump channel. Finch looks to get forward but his weight isn't fully forward as he looks to punch this down the ground. Ends up inside-edging into his pad;
8.2;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run back of a length outside off, jabbed into the point region;
8.1;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run dropped again. This is a much more difficult catch. Fullish, angling into off stump and straightening slightly. Pushes at it with firm hands, and it pops back to Bumrah at around chest height, to his left. Sticks his hand out, but the ball doesn't stick;
7.6;1;Natarajan to Finch, 1 run length ball angling in towards off stump, steps forward and across and clips through square leg;
7.5;4;Natarajan to Finch, FOUR runs overpitched. Wide-ish half-volley, and Finch shuffles down the pitch and drives smoothly to the right of extra-cover;
7.5;1w;Natarajan to Finch, 1 wide shortish, down the leg side, Finch looks to pull and misses;
7.5;1w;Natarajan to Finch, 1 wide he's been seeing Finch stepping across his stumps repeatedly. Looks for the full one on leg stump to try and bowl him behind his legs, but ends up firing down a leg-side wide;
7.4;1;Natarajan to Smith, 1 run length ball angling into the stumps. Steps across, meets it in line with off stump, and nearly beats short fine leg with the flick. Bumrah throws himself to his left and saves three runs;
7.3;1lb;Natarajan to Finch, 1 leg bye length ball angling into the stumps. Half-hearted appeal as Finch walks across to flick and misses. The impact, again, was outside off stump. Ball ricochets wide of slip for a leg-bye;
7.2;?;Natarajan to Finch, no run Natarajan goes for the yorker, and Finch, probably expecting it, looks for the reverse-ramp past short third man. Misses, and the ball rolls down to the keeper off the back pad;
7.2;2nb;Natarajan to Smith, (no ball) 1 run length ball, aiming towards top of off. Steps across and clips towards midwicket. No-ball too, but they could have got a wicket with it. Pandya moved quickly to his right at midwicket while Finch was slow to take off from the non-striker's end. The throw misses, though, and Finch can breathe;
7.1;?;Natarajan to Smith, no run full, angling into off stump, punched to mid-on;
6.6;4lb;Bumrah to Finch, 4 leg byes back of a length, angling down leg, and Finch misses his flick but picks up four leg-byes to the fine leg boundary. Insult to injury;
6.5;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run edged, and put down! He's been getting the ball to nip away in the corridor all through this spell, and he hits the perfect length with this ball, full enough so the movement finds the edge rather than beating it. Finch is half-forward, and he has a half-hearted prod at it, and the ball goes to the right of slip, at about shin height, and Shikhar Dhawan gets both hands to it but can't hold on;
6.4;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run back of a length, skids through with maybe a bit of inward movement, and beats the attempted flick. Hits him on the thigh pad;
6.3;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball angling into middle stump, clipped to mid-on. Hung in the air briefly but no worries for Finch;
6.2;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball close to off stump, defended with an open face to backward point;
6.1;4;Bumrah to Finch, FOUR runs rare outright bad ball from Bumrah, wide half-volley. Finch gets forward and drives between cover and mid-off;
5.6;?;Natarajan to Smith, no run wicket-maiden for Natarajan. What a start. This one holds its line in front of off, squares him up, and takes a soft outside edge to point;
5.5;?;Natarajan to Smith, no run fuller, but not driving length, Smith is back and across to push this back to him;
5.4;?;Natarajan to Smith, no run short of a length, just outside off, Smith shuffles across to work this to short midwicket again;
5.3;?;Natarajan to Smith, no run fuller, angling in, defended to short midwicket;
5.2;?;Natarajan to Smith, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
5.1;W;Natarajan to Labuschagne, OUT Natarajan on the board. India's first wicket in Powerplays this series. What a moment for Natarajan. Not the most spectacular one. Not something you see when you dream of a maiden wicket. This is short, just outside off, Marnus wants to pull, but gets a bottom edge onto the wicket. This is short and angling away, could he have cut instead of pulled?;Marnus Labuschagne b Natarajan 7 (13b 1x4 0x6) SR: 53.84;
4.6;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run length ball on the stumps, clipped down to mid-on;
4.5;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run back of a length on off stump, clipped watchfully to midwicket;
4.4;6;Bumrah to Finch, SIX runs fullish, angling in towards off stump, and that's some timing. Just stands there, stays slightly leg-side of the ball, and slices a six over point. He may have wanted to hit over cover, and the bat may have spun in his hands;
4.3;1;Bumrah to Labuschagne, 1 run back of a length outside off, waits on it and carves to third man;
4.2;?;Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run again that movement, and this time Labuschagne pulls out of his stroke halfway and leaves it alone;
4.1;?;Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run there, again. This could even be outswing. Length ball, fifth-stump channel, and it veers away against the angle as Labuschagne pokes at it with an angled bat. Beaten comprehensively;
3.6;?;Natarajan to Finch, no run back of a length, angling in towards off stump, defended to short extra-cover;
3.5;?;Natarajan to Finch, no run big appeal for lbw as Finch steps across and looks to whip one through square leg. I think the impact was well outside off stump, though;
3.4;?;Natarajan to Finch, no run length ball angling in towards off stump, gets forward to defend into the on side;
3.3;?;Natarajan to Finch, no run back of a length on off stump, punched to short extra-cover;
3.2;4;Natarajan to Finch, FOUR runs shot! That isn't a short ball, it's on off stump, and Finch is waiting for something marginal like that, and he simply half-swivels and swats it between midwicket and mid-on. Dismissive;
3.1;?;Natarajan to Finch, no run length ball slanting across towards off stump, gets forward to punch towards cover point;
2.6;?;Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run back of a length, sixth-stump line, left alone;
2.5;4;Bumrah to Labuschagne, FOUR runs shortish, not too much width, but that's a super shot from Labuschagne, stands tall and frees his arms through a back-foot drive between backward point and cover point;
2.4;1;Bumrah to Finch, 1 run back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and steers to third man;
2.3;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run back of a length, angling in towards off stump, defended into the covers;
2.2;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run slightly fuller length, angling in towards off stump, defended back towards the bowler;
2.1;?;Bumrah to Finch, no run and again, past the outside edge. Bumrah angles it in, hits that hard length in the corridor, and straightens it past a hesitant defensive prod;
1.6;?;Natarajan to Labuschagne, no run short, some width too, but the angle away from the right-hander defeats Labuschagne, who looks to cut without getting across with his back foot;
1.5;1;Natarajan to Finch, 1 run short, but this time it gets up to chest height, and closer to Finch's body with the line. Helped down to fine leg for a single;
1.4;?;Natarajan to Finch, no run back of a length close to off stump, chopped into the point region;
1.3;6;Natarajan to Finch, SIX runs drops short now, and it only gets up to about stomach height, just outside off. Finch swivels and dumps it over the forward square leg boundary. Welcome to international cricket!;
1.2;?;Natarajan to Finch, no run full, angling across to off stump, tiny bit of shape back in. Gets forward for a push to mid-off;
1.1;?;Natarajan to Finch, no run back of a length, slanting across to off stump, punched to mid-off;
0.6;?;Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run back of a length outside off, jags in off the seam this time and sneaks past the inside edge as Labuschagne looks to punch through cover. Kept a little low too;
0.5;2;Bumrah to Labuschagne, 2 runs onto the pads, clipped to the left of long leg;
0.4;?;Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run ooh, Bumrah likes this pitch. Similar line to the first two balls, but this keeps going with the angle with some extra bounce. Labuschagne does well to get on his toes, ride the bounce, and defend it by his feet;
0.3;?;Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run and again. This one pitches even closer to off stump before straightening past the edge. Labuschagne had to play at it, and the length just left his feet frozen;
0.2;?;Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run ooh, what a delivery. Back of a length, angling in, pitching in the fifth-stump channel, jagging away off the seam, and then swinging late as well, after it's passed the batsman's uncertain jab;
0.1;?;Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run back of a length outside off, chopped to backward point;

6.38pm We're all set to resume. Marnus Labuschagne joins Aaron Finch at the top of the order, and Jasprit Bumrah has the first of the two new balls.
Adarsh Gopi: "I loved Pandya's innings as much as the next bloke - but keep in mind that batting at 6 itself is a new challenge for him. Let him take his time, acclimatize. We just found Iyer and KL roles they can flourish in - give them the time. All India need is a reliable (preferably pace) bowling all-rounder and it'll be a good first XI."
Adityafortestch: "I would love to see Pandya at 5 and Jadeja at 6... Over the last two years, they have really shown enough maturity with the bat across formats and Pandya specially has come of age in this series. That could make India play with 6 bowlers + Pandya and play Rahul at 4!" -- Do you really want your tail to begin at No. 7?
Hafiz: "In the TV, they are discussing, should we ban switch hitting? I would say strongly NO and again NO." -- Did you say the second no after turning 180 degrees?
6.30pm Hello again. We've all been curious about what exactly Steven Smith meant when he said he'd "found his hands again", before this series. He's just explained to the broadcasters what that actually meant: he found his top hand going too far round the handle, so he's come back to a more neutral position, similar to how he says he used to grip the bat back in 2014-15 (India still have nightmares about that series) and during the 2015 World Cup (ditto, Sydney, semifinal).
