Data
4.45pm Australia had a bright start with Khawaja and Smith making back-to-back half-centuries. Australia, however, couldn't launch from the platform in the slog overs. They lost 4 for 39 in the last five overs, despite Bailey's blows. Holder generated extra bounce upfront before Brathwaite and Pollard mixed it up with their assortment of cutters. This pitch may not have much pace, but there is bounce. Starc is rested. But watch out for NCN and Hazlewood. Nikhil will be back soon. Ciao

 Innings Start
8.38pm The music is blaring, the crowd is singing, WI players shake hands with each other and joy abounds Basseterre because West Indies have done exceptionally well in their chase to thrash Australia on a tricky surface. Chasing 266, West Indies' openers gave them a lightning start to set up the chase. Significant contributions through the middle order, led by Samuels' 92, ensured there were no hiccups against a quality bowling attack. This win opens up this tri-series nicely.
Time for the presentation.
Marlon Samuels is the Man of the Match: "Most important thing was we won the game. Better than making a 100 and the team lose. There are some teams that you don't score against. We are gelling together a steam, we are building a team. We'll be hard to beat in the future."
Steven Smith: "We were 15-20 short. Should have got a few more than we did. Credit to West Indies, they bowled well. We didn't execute as well as we liked. Got to find ways to score a few more. Have to try to keep in the game and take wickets to make it go for as long as possible. We didn't field like an Australian side today, not up to scratch."
Jason Holder: "Had a bit of bounce early in the pitch. Important to control the Powerplay. We controlled reasonably well and knew we were one wicket away from getting into their middle order. Batsmen put up their hands today. That's what we ask of batsmen. Means a lot to us, we have lacked consistency over the past few years.
45.4;2;Coulter-Nile to Brathwaite, 2 runs that is it. Short and wide, steered past point as WI post a four-wicket win to beat Australia;
45.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Brathwaite, no run shortish on off, defended by his feet;
45.2;1;Coulter-Nile to Pollard, 1 run full and wide outside off, Pollard tries to clear midwicket again but toe-ends to third man;
45.1;?;Coulter-Nile to Pollard, no run short and wide, Pollard has a loose waft but misses;
44.6;3;Hazlewood to Pollard, 3 runs smashed over midwicket for three. Ran down to the pitch and flicked it away to bring WI closer;
44.5;4;Hazlewood to Pollard, FOUR runs shortish and wide, Pollard tries to get on top of the bounce but cannot. Goes through with his cut and gets it past point, races away;

43.6;?;Coulter-Nile to Brathwaite, no run honing in on that off stump but Brathwaite's bat intervenes. Much better over from NCN;
43.5;?;Coulter-Nile to Brathwaite, no run yorker on off, blocked;
43.4;W;Coulter-Nile to Holder, OUT gone. Holder is given. But he opts for the review. Good length delivery outside off, which jags back in again. Holder attempts a big swing and the ball goes through between bat and pad. Looks like he has missed it, but there is a sound. Not sure what it is. Swerves back in and Wade collects well, diving to his left. Not enough evidence to overturn this apparently, and Holder cannot believe it. Hangs on his bat before trudging off ever so slowly. Would have stayed not out had he been given not out. On replays, looks like there is a big deviation as the ball passes the bat, so good decision;Jason Holder c ?Wade b Coulter-Nile 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
43.3;?;Coulter-Nile to Holder, no run full on off, good line that. Driven to cover;
43.2;W;Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, OUT that is probably where NCN should have been from the start. Bowls the offcutter slightly wider outside off, and Ramdin wants to guide to third man but doesn't account for prodigious movement back into him. Goes right in the gap between bat and pad and clatters into off stump;Denesh Ramdin b Coulter-Nile 29 (59m 38b 1x4 1x6) SR: 76.31;
43.1;4;Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, FOUR runs whipped past square leg this time and there is no deep fielder so WI inch closer. Looking for that inswinger but too straight again;
43.1;1w;Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, 1 wide strays down leg for a wide;
42.6;6;Zampa to Pollard, SIX runs phew. That is ridiculous. Unbelievable. Nonsense. What? Tossed up outside off, Pollard tried to go over long-on by dragging it but got more of a leading edge which flies over cover. And went a fair way back too. A 90 degree change in shot direction, still enough muscle behind it.;

40.5;?;Zampa to Ramdin, no run flat on leg, Ramdin is struck on the pad and there is a massive appeal. Pad before bat, struck him in front of leg but where did that pitch?;
40.4;W;Zampa to Samuels, OUT and he's gone. What is happening? Zampa bowls this flat and quick down leg, Samuels goes back and allows the ball to hit his pad and he goes through for a leg bye. Wade runs across to short square leg, picks up, turns around and throws the stumps down while moving, at the bowler's end. Wow, what an effort from Wadey.;Marlon Samuels run out (?Wade) 92 (116m 87b 8x4 4x6) SR: 105.74;
40.3;6;Zampa to Samuels, SIX runs make that three in a row. More flight outside off, Samuels steps out and hits it in the same area. Clears long-off again, awesome hitting;
40.2;6;Zampa to Samuels, SIX runs six more. More flight on off, Samuels runs down and lofts it with the spin, Though he could clear long-ff and he did easily;
40.1;6;Zampa to Samuels, SIX runs six. Very risky stroke and he gets away with it. Flight on off, Samuels comes down and miscues his lofted drive off the outside half. It hangs in the air for a while., Head at long-off backtracks and takes the catch but is falling over. He tries to push it back as he falls over but pushes it over the boundary instead;
39.6;?;Marsh to Ramdin, no run full and straight to finish, worked to midwicket;
39.5;2;Marsh to Ramdin, 2 runs drifting down leg, whipped towards backward square leg where Khawaja gets around from fine leg to save the boundary with a dive;

39.2;2;Marsh to Samuels, 2 runs again. Shortish delivery on middle, Samuels tries to go through the off side but inside-edges to fine leg. Two a result;
39.1;?;Marsh to Samuels, no run short and wide, Samuels tries to go through point but the ball skews back to the bowler. Has lost all his shape and timing;
38.6;1;Hazlewood to Samuels, 1 run smeared to midwicket for one. Samuels trying to do too much;
38.5;1;Hazlewood to Ramdin, 1 run drifting down leg. Better option from Ramdin as he clips to deep square leg;
38.4;1;Hazlewood to Samuels, 1 run looks to go straighter this time but that angle helps a squirt off the inside half to long-on;
38.3;2;Hazlewood to Samuels, 2 runs ooh, just wide of midwicket. Full and tailing back in towards off and middle, Samuels tries to go over cover but skews to wide long-on;
38.2;?;Hazlewood to Samuels, no run full and straight, Samuels chops one back to the bowler. Interesting that Samuels is persistently looking to hit through the off side. With this angle, the leg side seems a higher percentage option;
38.1;?;Hazlewood to Samuels, no run it's working though. A leg-stump guard, his pads are well down leg. Hazlweood's inwinger hits Samuels but down leg;
37.6;1;Coulter-Nile to Samuels, 1 run back of a length down leg, nurdled to short fine leg for a run. The throw ricochets off Ramdin's pads to the sweeper cover and the crowd go up in raucous amazement that the batsmen aren't considering the overthrow;

37.2;2;Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, 2 runs slides down leg again, worked off his pads to wide fine leg for a brace. NCN has got to start this wider outside off;

36.6;?;Hazlewood to Samuels, no run shortish length on off, Samuels laces his cut but finds backward point this time;
36.5;?;Hazlewood to Samuels, no run short and wide, Samuels backs away and looks to scythe it away but misses. Or did he? Smith wants to review. He has missed it by a substantial distance. Was a hardly audible sound, which probably prompted Smith's call. But all's well for Samuels because there is no bat;
36.4;1;Hazlewood to Ramdin, 1 run tails back in from outside off, steered to third man. That shot should be put away with this movement;
36.3;?;Hazlewood to Ramdin, no run good length on off, chopped to point;
36.2;?;Hazlewood to Ramdin, no run back of a length on middle and leg, Ramdin smothers the ball into his pad flap. Picks up the ball and gives it to the bowler;

5.12pm Welcome to the chase. Could be an interesting one of West Indies get a good start. This should be a proper test of their ability to build patiently. Out come the players. This ball will reverse swing sharply later. Hazlewood has the ball.
