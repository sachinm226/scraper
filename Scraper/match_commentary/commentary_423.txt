surprise! Australia have declared, quite an adventurous decision from Michael Clarke, still plenty of time left in the day today, it is a substantial total but not exactly a mammoth one. Another bold decision from a man making his name as a positive captain. Must have taken into account the forecast for some showers over the next few days as well.
Here's what some of our readers think of the declaration.
Pete: "Good declaration, Clarke! I was getting worried Wade had been given ten overs to try to get a ton."
Naveenraju: "Clarke may have wrongly read the score as 550!!"
Tas: "Fantastic declaration. With the ball moving around so much, overcast conditions. Great captaincy."
Ashley: "seriously, who declares with a score of 450, was about to sit down and watch, but i think i will keep cricinfo on instead, cmon clarko, prove me wrong, please!"
Disco bob: "Clark is redefining modern captaincy with a declaration that no team in the world would even contemplate at this stage. Brilliant."
Big Max: "Hope I am wrong but I think the light will mean this is a wasted declaration. I would have batted longer."
Dipz is (overly) optimistic: "300 overs to go.. 150 overs at 4 an over shuld get us 600.. then we got 150 overs with a 150 run lead and hopefully some spin on the track ;) should be interesting.. lets hope ..."

Swapnil R sent this five minutes ago: "Scores are level - oh I mean in Nagpur and Hobart!" Australia racing ahead now.
 Innings Start
So Australia take a 114-run lead despite the best efforts of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Angelo Mathews. Siddle was relentless today, easily the best of Australia's bowlers today, giving away little all through his spell even after Hilfenhaus went off injured and Starc proved wayward.
Dan: "DRS is there to overturn shockers, and no doubt Herath's was a shocker. Both of SL referrals were used earlier out of hope more then anything, meaning there were no more for an obvious one. Until the system is refined, batsmen need to trust the umpire's decisions a little more on the close ones and leave referrals for what they were meant for."
5.15pm Rain A light drizzle in Hobart, the covers are out.

108.4;W;Lyon to Kulasekara, OUT flighted by Lyon, Kulasekara wants to send this out of the ground, swipes it but not far enough, the substitute Jordan Silk is waiting for that on the rope, end of the Kulasekara's innings;Nuwan Kulasekara c sub (JC Silk) b Lyon 23 (50m 42b 1x4 2x6) SR: 54.76;

12.25pm Lunch taken early. Next session 1-3:20, then from 3:40 to 5:51.
12.20pm Covers coming off After a short but heavy shower, the rain has stopped. They are drying the outfield now. Will keep you post on start time.

 Innings Start
Time for tea.
Rangana Herath becomes the leading wicket-taker of the year again, with 60 wickets.
The target is 393, a breeze compared to what they were set the last time they played a Hobart Test.
Australia still in charge here, but are a bowler short, and up against an experienced batting line-up. Big effort needed from the home team's bowling.
Janaka Siriwardene: "WOW! Herath has done it only in 9 matches and with 7 five-fors and 2 ten-fors. What a performance! Has really taken it over from Murali."
Meety: "For what it's worth Sri Lanka's average 4th innings score at Hobart is 379!"
Bharat: "As the saying goes, "Cricket is a old funny game", Another evident why test match is better than other format. Hopefully we have a competitive game ahead."

 Innings Start
Peter Siddle is the Man of the Match.
Top Test cricket on the final day in Hobart, as Sri Lanka resisted brilliantly, making Australia work for every wicket. The ball didn't seem to do much in the morning session, but by the evening it was moving both ways and the bounce was increasingly unpredictable. Siddle did the grunt work early on, and got the wickets of Sri Lanka's experienced middle-order batsmen before Starc polished off the tail with a hostile spell towards the end of the game.
Brydon Coverdale's match report is updated here and we'll have plenty of analysis later in the day from Dan Brettig and Andrew Fernando.
John Hasting tweets: "Great work Aussie boys. Awesome effort. @CricketAus p siddy outstanding. #mom"
And Russel Arnold says: "Well done Australia.... Had to work really hard for it but stuck to their task... Brave effort SL"
And this just in, Peter Siddle cleared of ball-tampering charges. Match referee Chris Broad says:



"In the opinion of the umpires, there was no evidence to suggest that the condition of the ball was changed, or that the video or photographic evidence would support a charge under the Code of Conduct, so they will not be laying any charges relating to these incidents."
Thanks everyone for joining the discussion today. Next up the Boxing Day Test. See you then. Cheers!
