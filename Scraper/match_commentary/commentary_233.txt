 Innings Start
India's last four wickets have added 123 runs, but the lead is nearly 100 for Australia. Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar, Saha, they all made Australia work hard. The home batsmen have to push this game forward now. There is also the question of how many they would want their bowlers to send down on day five, after 162 overs in the first innings, the series in the bag and with a World Cup around the corner. Australia have taken the heavy roller
161.6;W;Harris to Yadav, OUT the new ball brings the end of the innings, Yadav has a heave at a length ball, the top edge swirls over the cordon, Haddin waves away the other fielders as he settled under it, has to rush forward as it comes down finally, and holds on as he falls on to the ground;Umesh Yadav c ?Haddin b Harris 4 (12m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 44.44;

159.6;?;Lyon to Shami, no run that is handled quite well for a tailender, Shami wanted to keep strike with a dabbed single but saw it kicking in and turning, and decided to leave, there is an appeal as Australia think he has gloved it on its way to the keeper, but umpire Kettleborough is not interested, does not seem to be anything on the replays, and there is nothing on HotSpot;

153.2;?;Lyon to Shami, no run stretches forward to defend to off;
153.1;W;Lyon to Bhuvneshwar, OUT there is a gentle appeal for a catch to slip here, it was very full outside off, and he tried to squeeze it away, pitching almost on the crease this, bat has taken a chunk out of the ground here, the ball has carried to slip, is there some bat on ball there, bat hitting ground and ball pitching has happened almost at the same time, he has been given by the third umpire, it did change direction after passing the bat, and that could have been if there was an outside edge on the way up, but can't be absolutely sure;Bhuvneshwar Kumar c Watson b Lyon 30 (89m 75b 5x4 0x6) SR: 40;

 Innings Start
b>5.50 pm With one over left, the umpires have decided to go back. It has been dark throughout the evening, and looks like there is some rain around. The lead has rocketed to nearly 350, thanks to Burns' late charge. There have been several unplayable deliveries in the innings on a wearing pitch, but you won't come to know that if you look at the scorecard. India have been smashed all around by Smith, Burns and Rogers, and their most economical bowler is the part-timer Raina, which tells you a lot about how the others went. Australia have the night to ponder their strategy for the final day. We will be back at 10.15 am tomorrow.

 Innings Start
The Australia captain accepts the series trophy from Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar, and that is all we have from this series for the moment. Good bye
Steven Smith: "Very good series win, that is the most important thing for us. Tough day in the office for us. We did not get the variable bounce we were expecting on a day five pitch. There were a couple of chances that did not come off the glove and things like that. Credit to India for the way they played today. Really enjoyed this series, some pretty flat wickets and I have enjoyed batting, to make four hundreds in a series is very satisfying. I have really enjoyed captaining these guys, they played their hearts out today."
Virat Kohli: "It has been a hard fought series. We wanted to play hard cricket, give a fight, and that is what the boys have done. In Adelaide, and even today we thought we had a chance, but Australia kept coming back. The way they have composed themselves after the (Phillip Hughes) incident and come out is commendable. At tea time, I was not 100% sure if we wanted to go for the target. After Vijay got out, I thought why not take a chance, we are not coming back here for a while, If it does not happen it does not. The intent and character the side is showing is important. These guys have stepped up and shown they have the character and game at the international level, Rahul especially after the kind of debut he had. It is tough in Australia, I have experienced that before."
Steven Smith is the Man of the Match and the Man of the Series
And that will be it for this game and the series with just an inconsequential delivery left. Ajinkya Rahane has led India to a draw, and Australia have taken the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2-0. Rahane grabs a couple of stumps, Bhuvneshwar takes another, Australia have given it everything, they have sent down 251 mostly disciplined overs in the game with the break of a lone session in between. That is a staggering effort.
Rahane - who has a profile this month in The Cricket Monthly - and Bhuvneshwar played out 69 deliveries after India went from 178 for 2 and 201 for 3 to 217 for 7 against the reversing ball. Australia went for the new one immediately, though, and that did not have the same effect
CricGal: "Bhuvi and Rahane- you beauty! "
jagan: "The difference between the 30 odd that Rohit makes and the 30 odd that Rahane made. Case in point why statistics are not everything."
