5.41pm: Would you believe it, South Africa have finished their overs four minutes early! Australia ended up with 271 for 8, they benefited from a few missed run-out chances and dropped catches. The South Africans were uncharacteristically lax in the field.
"I've got an answer to the question asked back in over # 2 about two sets of brothers on opposing teams. There was a response that the last time was the Waugh and Flower brothers in 2001 - I have found (don't ask how) that on October 19 2008, that brothers Lamech Onyango and Nehemiah Odhiambo turned out for Kenya against Nial and Kevin O'Brien for Ireland. Hardly earth shattering teams, but it's an international ODI," says Dave.
I'll be back in 40 minutes for the chase. You could spend the break trying our quiz, or by checking out Cricinfo 3D.

 Innings Start
10.07 pm: Phew, what entertainment! South Africa were cruising when Duminy and McKenzie were batting. Then their middle order collapsed and Australia were on top with four overs remaining. However, Albie Morkel played a fiery cameo and made superb use of the final Powerplay. He finished with 40 off 18 balls and gave South Africa a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. He's the Player of the Match.
