Data
Mills finishes with 4 for 35 and Australia have failed to bat out their alloted overs. Their struggles continue from the South Africa series, and New Zealand need 181 to take a lead in the series.
Ponting won the toss and elected to bat first, but that decision quickly backfired as the top order crumbled and Australia limped to 5 for 55 from 20 overs. A 61-run rescue partnership between Michael Hussey and Haddin boosted Australia, but a late flurry of wickets allowed New Zealand to maintain their grip.
