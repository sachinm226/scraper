5.38 pm: So Australia bowled out on the stroke of tea. A little earlier in fact, but they'll take tea now. They've got a very good total on board and have made New Zealand toil a fair bit. Australia will get to bowl under lights in the final session, exactly as they would have wanted it. New Zealand's bowling was very disciplined, even if they would have liked to hold on to a few more catches - though the fielding in general was very good. But they have at least ensured Australia haven't got an out of sight total. If they can survive relatively damage free in the final session, they will come out under bright sunshine tomorrow and can do to Australia what Australia did to them. Alex Malcolm will be back to take you through the final session.
Neil Wagner: Tough conditions and pretty proud of the boys the way they kept fighting. Full credit to the Australia. (On his workload) just don't think about it too much. (on the push ups after lunch) Yeah just to get the body going. you get a little bit stiff.
146.2;W;Southee to Paine, OUT and he's caught down the legside. Southee and Wagner have four each. He bowled this short and down legside, Paine went to pull but got a glove only. Watling tumbles to his left and gathers the ball.;Tim Paine c ?Watling b Southee 39 (181m 105b 2x4 0x6) SR: 37.14;
146.1;?;Southee to Paine, no run beauty. Length ball, lifts off a length and moves away, whistles past the outside edge. Nothing Paine could have done about taht;
145.6;W;Wagner to Lyon, OUT third time lucky for Wagner. It's been an eventful over and it's ended with a wicket. The best short ball of the over perhaps, because it climbed into him and denied room to free his arms for the pull. Lyon had decided he's going to go for it, and does so again. Not so well controlled and picked out fine leg this time.;Nathan Lyon c de Grandhomme b Wagner 8 (5m 6b 2x4 0x6) SR: 133.33;
145.5;?;Wagner to Lyon, no run quicker one that's full and angling across him, outside off. He goes for the drive, but misses;
145.4;4;Wagner to Lyon, FOUR runs Lyon's taking on Wagner's short ball!. Another one banged in towards his ribcage, he moves inside the line and pulls it fine;
145.3;4;Wagner to Lyon, FOUR runs there it is, banged in short but Lyon was looking for it too, swivels back and pulls through square for a boundary. Not timed perfectly, but got the placement spot on;
145.2;?;Wagner to Lyon, no run swinging into him again, slower ball yorker. Lyon defends comfortably.;
145.1;?;Wagner to Lyon, no run full on off stump, almost a yorker, defended back to the bowler;
144.6;W;Southee to Starc, OUT superbly caught by Williamson running back at mid-off. Starc's adventurousness finally results in his downfall, not before a valuable contribution though. Length ball outside off, he swiped at it without moving his feet, it goes up high off the toe end, and Williamson keeps eyes on the ball while running back and holds on.;Mitchell Starc c Williamson b Southee 30 (48m 41b 3x4 1x6) SR: 73.17;
144.5;?;Southee to Starc, no run that one is angled too far across and Starc isn't going to reach that far, lets it go;
144.4;?;Southee to Starc, no run angled across, ends up on the fifth stump, Starc wants to feel bat on ball so he goes for the drive but gets it off the inside half, back to the bowler;
144.3;2;Southee to Starc, 2 runs fuller outside off, he goes for the big drive, but splices it off the outside edge. Swirls into no-man's land beyond wide mid-off;
144.3;1w;Southee to Starc, 1 wide puts his back into it and bowls a bouncer that flies over him. So far that it's a wide. Starc is a tall man but he didn't even have to bend;
144.2;?;Southee to Starc, no run fuller length on leg stump, misses the flick and is struck on the pads. Wagner appeals but that probably pitched outside leg;
144.1;?;Southee to Starc, no run length ball angling across him, ends up well outside off and he's not letting his bat come anywhere near that;
143.6;1;Wagner to Starc, 1 run yorker singing into him, gets an edge onto pad as he flicks it to fine leg.;
143.5;?;Wagner to Starc, no run another full toss, lower this time. Slapped it back with a horizontal bat, but Wagner got a hand up and blocked the ball;
143.4;?;Wagner to Starc, no run short outside off again, Starc plays it beside his body and steers it down, but second slip fields;
143.3;?;Wagner to Starc, no run high full toss, almost waist height, and Starc is perhaps caught off guard. Drives it back to the bowler. Has a brief look at the square leg umpire too;
143.2;?;Wagner to Starc, no run short ball outside off, lets it go;
143.1;1;Wagner to Paine, 1 run full outside off, bowled it slower I think, and Paine had to adjust and stroke his off-drive. Paine has been taking some risky singles to that area and sets off again. Williamson moves to his right and lets loose a throw that just misses the stumps. Paine would have been gone if he had hit. run out chance missed;
142.6;?;Southee to Starc, no run length ball outside off, watchfully lets it go;
142.5;?;Southee to Starc, no run beaten. Length ball outside off in the channel and he tries to cut, but misses.;
142.4;?;Southee to Starc, no run dropped by Raval at mid-on. Not a dolly of a chance, but a catchable one. Full outside off, and Starc goes for the drive again. Doesn't get underneath the ball enough and hits it to mid-on. Raval has to move forward and to his right, but gets low enough to gather the ball with two hands. Can't hold on.;
142.3;?;Southee to Starc, no run short of a length and into him, Starc goes well back and defends solidly to point;
142.2;?;Southee to Starc, no run length ball, wide outside off, he goes for the drive, but doesn't connect well, and the ball rolls to mid-off;
142.1;?;Southee to Starc, no run bangs it in short and forces Starc to evade it at the last moment as it whistles past his helmet;
141.6;1;Santner to Starc, 1 run punched on the front foot into the offside;
141.5;6;Santner to Starc, SIX runs smoked. This was on the cards. Starc gets one in his slot and launches into a lofted on-drive that goes all the way over long-on;
141.4;1;Santner to Paine, 1 run fuller angling into him, driven gently to mid-off and this time the quick single is on, and they take it;
141.3;?;Santner to Paine, no run tossed up on the stumps, driven off the inside half of the bat to mid-on. Paine wants a run, but Starc sends him back.;

140.6;?;Southee to Paine, no run length ball angling into him, defended towards cover;
140.5;?;Southee to Paine, no run a bit fuller and closer to off, coming in with the angle. Paine lets it go, covering the angle, knowing that it will bounce well over the stumps;
140.4;4;Southee to Paine, FOUR runs lovely shot. Not too short and not too wide outside off, but Paine is in position early and cuts it backward of point;
140.3;1;Southee to Starc, 1 run tempts him with a fullish one wide outside off, but Starc makes good connection, stroking a drive through cover;
140.2;?;Southee to Starc, no run length ball angling into him, pushed back to the bowler's left;
140.1;1;Southee to Paine, 1 run length ball down leg, easily tucked to fine leg;
139.6;4;Santner to Starc, FOUR runs another one. This was almost a lazy shot. Went forward and reached for the ball, his long reach means he gets to it and lifts it over mid-on's left and into the boundary;
139.5;?;Santner to Starc, no run flat on a length outside off, worked to midwicket;
139.4;1;Santner to Paine, 1 run short and wide outside off, chopped to deep cover;

139.1;?;Santner to Starc, no run flatter on a length outside off, punched back to the bowler, not timed;
138.6;?;Raval to Paine, no run some sharp turn and bounce from a length on the stumps, Paine has to adjust late and tap it down with soft hands from chest high almost;
138.5;1;Raval to Starc, 1 run tossed up a bit wider of off, he drives to cover;

137.5;?;Santner to Paine, no run fuller on the stumps, defended with a lunge forward;
137.4;?;Santner to Paine, no run drifts down leg, Paine went down to paddle but misses it. Watling thinks there was glove on it, and Santner's also appealing. Nothing from the umpire.;
137.3;?;Santner to Paine, no run quicker one, skidded on into him, but Paine got his bat down in time to jam it towards point;
137.2;?;Santner to Paine, no run tossed up on off, went to drive, but doesn't time it. The bowler fields;

136.2;?;Raval to Starc, no run fuller on off, flicked backward of square;
136.1;?;Raval to Starc, no run good flight, on a length outside off, doesn't turn in much. Starc goes well back and reads it off the pitch, defends tentatively;

135.3;?;Santner to Paine, no run length on off, blocked into the offside;
135.2;2;Santner to Paine, 2 runs does that count as a drop?. Too close to cut even though Paine was going back and across, and he gets an edge that goes past the keeper and to first slip's left. But Taylor there, was going to his right. In fact, it brushed Watling's glove on the way too, but that was too quick for the keeper to catch;
135.1;?;Santner to Paine, no run drags it down a little short, and Paine goes back to punch this but can't beat cover;
134.6;1;Raval to Paine, 1 run nicely tossed up outside off, but he comes on the front foot and slaps it past cover;

134.4;W;Raval to Cummins, OUT Bowled him around his legs! Raval has a wicket in Tests! Brilliant piece of bowling. Great reward. This was drifting down leg, Cummins went down to sweep fine but didn't cover the line, it got under the bat, pitched outside leg, turned and hit leg stump! Shane Warne would have been happy with that;Pat Cummins b Raval 20 (76m 85b 2x4 0x6) SR: 23.52;

116.3;?;Raval to Cummins, no run beauty!. Tossed up, dips on him, has him coming forward to defend, grips and spins past the bat;
116.2;1;Raval to Paine, 1 run tossed up on middle, Paine clips to mid-on on the front foot, and sets off for a run. Cummins is very late to respond but he ends up diving in to just about make it in safely;

115.3;?;Santner to Paine, no run gets this straighter, but the batsman is equal to it, defending down the pitch;
115.2;?;Santner to Paine, no run given some air outside off, defended on the front foot into the offside;
115.1;?;Santner to Paine, no run good line and length, makes the batsman lunge forward to defend.;
114.6;?;Southee to Cummins, no run big appeal for caught behind but the umpire is unmoved. There was a definite noise there, but perhaps it was ball flicking pad. Southee bowled the off-cutter that time and it snuck through between bat and pad. great decision by the umpire because that missed the bat and clipped his thigh pad on the way to Watling.;
114.5;?;Southee to Cummins, no run digs it in short, good surprise ball. Cummins spots it and ducks safely under;

113.2;?;Santner to Paine, no run tossed up outside off, fuller one, steered to point;
113.1;?;Santner to Paine, no run big appeal and New Zealand have opted to review. Went with the arm but might have just struck him outside the line? He was pushing forward in defence but playing for the turn when there wasn't any. No inside edge. And impact is in fact outside, so New Zealand have lost a review. That skidded onto him and Paine played down the wrong line.;
112.6;?;Southee to Cummins, no run length ball outside off, left alone;
112.5;?;Southee to Cummins, no run full on off, shaping into him this time, driven back to the bowler but not timed well.;
112.4;?;Southee to Cummins, no run length ball on off, was a bit late in going on the back foot, ends up jabbing it to gully;
112.3;?;Southee to Cummins, no run full, shaping away from him, he gets on the front foot to defend outside off. Gets a thickish edge that rolls to gully;
112.2;?;Southee to Cummins, no run full ball on off, driven to mid-off confidently;
112.1;W;Southee to Head, OUT driven straight to cover! Head is going to be disappointed with that shot. Southee had been testing his patience with the wide line outside off. This one was similar and Head couldn't rein his shot in, went for the drive, but it wasn't quite a half-volley and he didn't keep it along the ground, ends up getting it on the bottom half of the bat and driving straight to the man stationed there, possibly just for that shot.;Travis Head c Santner b Southee 56 (135m 97b 10x4 0x6) SR: 57.73;
111.6;?;Santner to Paine, no run length ball drawing him forward, but he doesn't quite get to the pitch and a thick edge rolls towards gully;
111.5;1;Santner to Head, 1 run floated up on a length, gently clipped to mid-on. He's alive to the possibility of a single and they take a quick run;
111.4;?;Santner to Head, no run length outside off, pushed back to the bowler;
111.3;?;Santner to Head, no run tossed up outside off, he takes a few steps forward and drives, but cover dives to his right to field;
111.2;1;Santner to Paine, 1 run tossed up outside off again, inviting the drive. Too full though and Paine gets some nice meat on the cover drive, but can't beat the in-field;
111.1;4;Santner to Paine, FOUR runs and Paine's had enough of leaving balls, this one is wide outside off and in the slot, he goes on the front foot to smear a cover drive that bisects the field and finds the boundary;
110.6;?;Southee to Head, no run back of a length and closer to off, he defends on the back foot towards mid-off;
110.5;4;Southee to Head, FOUR runs full and wide outside off and Head reaches for it and makes good connection with the cut. Valiant effort by deep point to dive and try to save the boundary is unsuccessful;
110.4;?;Southee to Head, no run sharp movement into him! He's been bowling on a fifth and sixth stump line and Head is comfortable leaving those, but this is slightly closer and comes in very sharply. He's left it alone but it bounced over the stumps;
110.3;?;Southee to Head, no run fuller outside off, driven firmly but straight to cover;
110.2;?;Southee to Head, no run length ball on a sixth stump line, he's not going anywhere near it;

109.2;1;Santner to Head, 1 run slightly short and he rocks back to slash this through point;
109.1;4;Santner to Head, FOUR runs floated up, but drifts on the pads and Head spots it early to sweep it fine and raise his fifty. Good knock, despite a few moments of lapses in concentration. But he had to see off some penetrative bowling;
108.6;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run shape away from the batsman, but well outside off and left alone again;
108.5;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run length ball outside off, Paine's not interested in getting bat near it;
108.4;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run full and well outside off, left well alone;
108.3;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run bit of wobble again, into the right-hander this time. it's very full though and he clips it gently to mid-on;
108.2;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run fuller outside off, stroked to extra cover;
108.1;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run big appeal but New Zealand won't review. Southee indicates from slip that height might have been in issue. Length ball, pitched on off and nipped in a touch to defeat his attempted nurdle to strike him on the knee roll. Replays show it would have gone over the stumps;
107.6;?;Wagner to Head, no run back to the short ball outside leg line, and Head has a swing at it, but doesn't connect with the pull;
107.5;?;Wagner to Head, no run fuller and swinging across him, bowled it slower. Head deals with it reasonably well, digs out a drive towards mid-on;
107.4;?;Wagner to Head, no run length on the stumps this time, moves back and across to defend it towards extra cover;
107.3;?;Wagner to Head, no run back of a length just outside leg again. Tries to move inside the line to flick again, but misses again;
107.2;?;Wagner to Head, no run short again but cramping him for room this time on leg stump, and Head tries to move inside the line to pull but can't connect;
107.1;4;Wagner to Head, FOUR runs dismissed. Short outside off, and Head gets into position early, going on the back foot and smoking a pull that forces Aleem Dar at square leg to jump out of the way;
106.6;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run fuller and closer to off stump, defended to cover;
106.5;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run back to a full length outside off, left alone;
106.4;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run ooh, that was much closer to off stump and Paine left it again. Hits it on the seam and gets good carry as Watling collects in front of his face;
106.3;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run sticks to a full length on a fifth stump line, swinging away. Left alone;
106.2;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run nice line outside off, and moving away, left alone;
106.1;2;de Grandhomme to Paine, 2 runs gets some swing into the right-hander but strays on the pads and is picked off through midwicket;

105.5;?;Wagner to Head, no run back of a length, on target, he hops on the back foot and defends it to the bowler's right with a straight bat;
105.4;?;Wagner to Head, no run short ball but down leg again and this time Head just stays still and watches it go to the keeper;

105.2;?;Wagner to Head, no run fuller, swinging across him, clipped off his toes to midwicket;
105.1;?;Wagner to Head, no run back of a length but well outside leg. Head tries to pull it off his hips, but it's too far down leg and he misses. Not the most advisable shot to play perhaps;
104.6;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run length outside off, left alone;
104.5;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run length on the stumps, defended on the front foot;
104.4;1;de Grandhomme to Head, 1 run run out chance missed at the striker's end. Grandhomme has been getting some movement, and this one came back in more sharply. Head patted it towards point and set off for a non-existent run. Was almost halfway down when Nicholls swooped in from gully. Had time to aim at the stumps but missed. They take the overthrow;
104.3;?;de Grandhomme to Head, no run some movement for CdG, who's keeping his line well outside off and coming in;
104.2;?;de Grandhomme to Head, no run swing and a miss! wobbling on a full length on a fifth stump line, tempted him into driving. But he doesn't connect;

103.2;?;Wagner to Head, no run banged in short but down leg, can be easily left alone;
103.1;?;Wagner to Head, no run ooh almost chopped on. Back of a length going across him, tempted him to cut, but gets a bottom edge that clangs into thigh pad;

102.5;?;de Grandhomme to Paine, no run 117kph, good length, wide of off, he leaves;

101.3;W;Wagner to Labuschagne, OUT Bowled him! Brilliant from Wagner! Around the legs from around the wicket! That's hard to do. 130kph, fuller length and some significant swing into the right hander, Labuschagne shuffled across the crease to trying to glance it fine, he exposed leg stump and Wagner hit it flush!;Marnus Labuschagne b Wagner 143 (369m 240b 18x4 1x6) SR: 59.58;

AJ: "I wonder what a NZ cricketer did in a past life to result in the nation being this cursed? The bowler injuries here, Llong last time we visited, CWC19 final etc What's next, some sort of teeth-brushing incident to take out Wagner?"
 Innings Start
Innings break Australia will bat again. The openers tore off and will face one over before lunch. Mitchell Starc: "Most consistent I've bowled I think. (Re - de Grandhomme's dismissal) We were confident early. From the side on it looked like it went up off the thumb."
Australia will bat as long as they can now to give their undermanned attack a chance to rest before a fourth innings assault. The heavy roller is on the pitch.
Daniel : "Would not surprise me if Aus go for a session and a half try and get another 150-200 runs and have the kiwis back in under lights tonight!" That would be interesting to see. There is eight sessions left in the game.
55.2;W;Lyon to Southee, OUT sliced to backward point and an easy catch for Neser! Lyon tossed it up, Southee's eyes lit up, he skipped down and tried to launch, he didn't quite get there, sliced across it as it didn't turn as much, it sliced high to backward point and Neser cruised around to take the catch easily;Tim Southee c sub (MG Neser) b Lyon 8 (31m 29b 1x4 0x6) SR: 27.58;

54.5;?;Labuschagne to Ferguson, no run another ripping leg break, shorter, pitches middle and beats the edge on the back foot;
54.4;W;Labuschagne to Santner, OUT bowled him through the gate with a classic leg break! Beautifully bowled. Tossed up into the footmarks outside Santner's off stump, he drives against the turn, it spins sharply through the gate and crashes into off stump! Shades of the King in that one;Mitchell Santner b Labuschagne 2 (37m 19b 0x4 0x6) SR: 10.52;

52.5;?;Labuschagne to Santner, no run full toss, he hammers a drive back at the non striker's stumps! Did Labuschagne get a touch? They are appealing for run out. Doesn't matter. Southee got his bat down;
52.4;?;Labuschagne to Santner, no run quicker leg break down leg, Paine doesn't glove cleanly;

49.4;?;Lyon to Southee, no run good length, on off, he defends;
49.3;4;Lyon to Southee, FOUR runs bottom edge runs fine of Smith slip! No chance to catch this. It was shorter, he cut hard and it went off the toe straight down past Smith and away;
49.2;?;Lyon to Southee, no run tossed up outside off, he pushes to mid off;
49.1;?;Lyon to Southee, no run back of a length, outside off, he's back and pushing back to the bowler;

48.5;?;Starc to Santner, no run beaten by a 145kph delivery that just nipped away off the seam outside off. That was a beauty;

47.1;1;Lyon to Santner, 1 run drifting in, he gets an inside edge and it runs between his legs to fine leg for one;
46.6;W;Starc to de Grandhomme, OUT caught at second slip! Everyone waited for Aleem Dar. He took an age to give it. Then did. Then de Grandhomme reviewed after discussing with Santner. Was this off the helmet rather than glove? It was a brute of a bouncer straight at his face, he thrust the gloves up in hope. Did it touch the glove onto helmet and then to Smith at second? Nothing on hot spot. RTS seems inconclusive. It definitely came flush off the helmet. But there's no conclusive evidence for Marias Erasmus to overturn Aleem Dar's onfield decision. So it stays out!;Colin de Grandhomme c Smith b Starc 23 (48m 21b 3x4 0x6) SR: 109.52;
46.5;?;Starc to de Grandhomme, no run 142kph, bouncer over leg, he just gets inside the line to let it go;
46.4;4;Starc to de Grandhomme, FOUR runs 141kph, back of a length but some width, he punches off the back foot behind point! Back to back from CdG. Had a lot of time there too;
46.3;4;Starc to de Grandhomme, FOUR runs magnificent pull shot! Chest high short ball and made it look pedestrian. He stood tall and thumped it with ease over midwicket. It made a pure sound off the bat;
46.2;?;Starc to de Grandhomme, no run 137kph, shorter length rising outside off, he defends off the gloves into the off side;
46.1;?;Starc to de Grandhomme, no run 139kph, back of a length on off, he stands up and defends from the crease;
45.6;W;Lyon to Taylor, OUT everybody saw it coming. And it's all because of that one ball in his first over. That one giant monster of an offbreak that sneaked through bat and pad and nearly bowled Taylor has created demons. He doesn't know how much Lyon is turning the ball and as a result he's often been playing inside the line of the ball. Here too, a tossed up delivery, all tempting like, draws Taylor towards it. He tries to block it out but the ball dips, turns only just, juuuust enough to take the outside edge and land safely in Smith's hands. Masterful stuff from Lyon.;Ross Taylor c Smith b Lyon 80 (205m 134b 9x4 0x6) SR: 59.7;
45.5;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run full and outside off, defends;
45.4;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run full on off stump, Taylor keeps it out.;
45.3;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run shimmies out to slap a tossed up delivery to cover - or through it and he thinks he almost has until the fielder dives to his right and prevents a single. Head even hits the stumps direct;
45.2;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run beats the outside edge as he presses forward, lured in by the slower pace and the better flight.;
45.1;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run loads up the sweep again, but the ball is a bit too far in front of him for that shot and he can't quite reach there in time.;
44.6;1;Labuschagne to Taylor, 1 run slices a full and wide delivery out to the sweeper;
44.5;?;Labuschagne to Taylor, no run full on off stump, he hits to short cover;
44.4;?;Labuschagne to Taylor, no run short and outside off, chops it to backward point;

44.2;1;Labuschagne to Taylor, 1 run loops it up on off stump, Taylor drives to deep point;
44.1;?;Labuschagne to Taylor, no run good length, outside off, no interest;
43.6;?;Lyon to de Grandhomme, no run;
43.5;?;Lyon to de Grandhomme, no run slower through the air this time and as a result it dips before de Grandhomme can reach it on middle stump, grips the pitch and then kicks up almost to the batsman's face;
43.4;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run there's another one off the outside edge. All of this is the result of his changes of pace. The quick ones go straight on. He still gives them a good rip though and thanks to that big turning offbreak earlier in his spell both Taylor and de Grandhomme are playing for spin. Single to third man after the batsman hurries into a block while being stuck in the crease;
43.3;1;Lyon to de Grandhomme, 1 run nudges it through midwicket;
43.2;?;Lyon to de Grandhomme, no run tosses it up on off stump, de Grandhomme tries to whip it down the ground with the turn, no luck;
43.1;2;Lyon to de Grandhomme, 2 runs goes back to block, but he ends up with an outside edge that slides past first slip. Lyon isn't getting as much spin as the batsmen fear and he's preying on that;
42.6;?;Labuschagne to Taylor, no run shortish and outside off, he mis-hits the cut to point;
42.5;?;Labuschagne to Taylor, no run full and outside off, drives to cover;
42.4;?;Labuschagne to Taylor, no run short, quick and straight and Taylor, as much as he wants to attack it, has to stick to defence;
42.3;?;Labuschagne to Taylor, no run too short and too wide, Taylor has the right idea with the cut shot, but he can't reach it;
42.2;?;Labuschagne to Taylor, no run good length, outside off, leaves it alone;
42.1;1;Labuschagne to de Grandhomme, 1 run full toss outside off, spears it through cover;
41.6;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run shifts back to a good length ball outside off - and this one doesn't turn either. Blocked safely enough;
41.5;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run delves into the sweep shot, but it deflects off Wade at short leg and goes over to midwicket;
41.4;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run again teases him to play away from his body, Taylor gets sucked in again, and this time the ball doesn't turn, just kicks up past the top edge and beats him going straight on;
41.3;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run flighted delivery on off stump, defends;
41.2;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run through the gate! Taylor's lucky not to be bowled here! Massive turn on the offbreak and its just about the perfect one, tossed up, drifting away from the right-hander, daring him to cover drive against the turn. Taylor goes for it and then heaves a sigh of relief;
41.1;1;Lyon to de Grandhomme, 1 run weeeeelll, it wasn't full. De Grandhomme has time to rock back and punch down towards a deepish mid-on;
40.6;?;Labuschagne to Taylor, no run another cut shot and as good as he is with it - here he makes room for it - he can't beat the field;
40.5;?;Labuschagne to Taylor, no run waits for the legbreak to turn and then swats it on top of the bounce. Taylor does all this looking for a boundary but his late cut is stopped by backward point;
40.4;1;Labuschagne to de Grandhomme, 1 run tosses it up but de Grandhomme is happy to play it along the ground, refusing to pick up the bait and instead taking a single behind point;
40.3;?;Labuschagne to de Grandhomme, no run good length, outside off, no shot;
40.2;1;Labuschagne to Taylor, 1 run loops it up outside off and Taylor lashes it to deep point;
40.1;2;Labuschagne to Taylor, 2 runs even the legspinner starts short! And Taylor rocks back to pull it hard to the right of deep midwicket;
39.6;4;Cummins to de Grandhomme, FOUR runs it's pinched up! A ball has been PITCHED UP! And de Grandhomme has hammered it down the ground. Of course, he is on the back foot, and it's his hands and his instincts that drive him into the shot, but boy has he timed it well. Screams away to the right of mid-off;
39.5;1;Cummins to Taylor, 1 run takes on the short ball and smacks it to deep square leg. Firmly hit pull shot but there's protection;
39.4;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run bangs in it. Ducks under. Rise, rinse...;
39.3;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run another bouncer but this is off target, down leg, and Taylor can easily get away;
39.2;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run gets up off his toes to knock down the back of a length ball on off stump to short leg;
39.1;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run gets out of the way of another sharp short ball angled into the body;
38.6;1;Starc to Taylor, 1 run another pull shot and the 145 kph short ball lobs over to deep square leg;
38.5;?;Starc to Taylor, no run looks to pull against the angle and the banged in ball zips past his right shoulder, across him, beating him;
38.4;4;Starc to Taylor, FOUR runs nails the pull shot. It helps when they come up to just around the waist. Taylor climbs all over it, rolling his wrist and placing it between long leg and deep square leg;
38.3;?;Starc to Taylor, no run makes it rise up to Taylor's chest again, but this time Taylor is able to get up along with it and blunt it safely past silly point's left;
38.2;?;Starc to Taylor, no run another bouncer and Taylor is terribly late on the hook shot;
38.1;1;Starc to de Grandhomme, 1 run falls short of second slip and it's Smith lurking there! Australia keep coming hard at the batsmen. The short ball angled across de Grandhomme surprises him. He looks to guide it behind point, but it bounces way more than he expects. Eventually adjusts to the problem and is still lucky the nick doesn't carry to the fielder;
37.6;3;Cummins to de Grandhomme, 3 runs carves it through cover. He loves it full and he shows just why. Crisp drive through the gap;
37.5;?;Cummins to de Grandhomme, no run good length, outside off, taps it in front of point;
37.4;?;Cummins to de Grandhomme, no run bouncer first up at 142 kph and he gets under it.;
37.3;W;Cummins to Watling, OUT softened him up! Or that's what everyone says anyway when a batsman is bowled after facing a short ball. Watling is slow in getting forward here. He has the right idea, the ball did need to be played. But Cummins has cranked it up. A 142 kph length ball kicks just a bit higher than he thinks it will, comes at him just a bit faster than he is ready for and it thuds into the bat even as he is still getting into the shot and ricochets onto the stumps. Spectacular bowling from Cummins. Just pure effort. Pure pain-barrier breaking effort;BJ Watling b Cummins 8 (42m 29b 1x4 0x6) SR: 27.58;
37.2;?;Cummins to Watling, no run ooooh, that's a snorter! Cummins, who has so far almost exclusively bowled full and looked for bowled and lbw against Watling, rips one in and it rears up at the nose. Watling sees the danger and sways out of the way;
37.1;1lb;Cummins to Taylor, 1 leg bye full, straight, clips the pad and it runs away down towards the fine leg boundary;
36.6;?;Starc to Watling, no run huge noise as he goes chasing after a wide one, but it's bat hitting the ground. Starc always has this thing, his left-arm angle and his sheer pace makes even the very good batsman suffer blips in concentration and play waaaaay away from the body;
36.5;?;Starc to Watling, no run back of a length on off stump, blocks it;
36.4;?;Starc to Watling, no run full and straight again, Watling keeps it out, no trouble;
36.3;2;Starc to Watling, 2 runs sweet timing on the off drive. And all he does is present a straight face after judging the length and line right. Simple stuff;
36.2;1;Starc to Taylor, 1 run lovely batting. Australia have committed to this bang it in plan, and they do have the bowlers for it. But has the ball itself gone too soft for it to succeed? Taylor hasn't so far been rushed facing the short ball and here he just waits for it, taps it into the vacant area to the right of the bowler and skips along for a single;
36.1;?;Starc to Taylor, no run sees an escape past the leg-side strangler as Taylor whips a ball off his knees towards the fine leg boundary, but leg gully dives to his right just in time;
35.6;?;Cummins to Watling, no run prevents a middle-stump seeking missile from its target;
35.5;?;Cummins to Watling, no run good length on off stump, pushes it safely to cover;
35.4;?;Cummins to Watling, no run cuts in off the pitch and nearly takes out off stump! Watling sees the ball well outside off stump and thinks he's perfectly happy to leave it. But there's a puff of dust as Cummins puts everything behind it;
35.3;?;Cummins to Watling, no run bouncer, typical quickie's reply. Watling knows it. He gets under it;
35.2;4;Cummins to Watling, FOUR runs beautiful straight drive. He had a life early when he went on to make a double-century. And here he is again allowing a very full ball to come onto him nicely and drills it down the ground past mid-on's left;
35.1;?;Cummins to Watling, no run back of a length and outside off, Watling lets it come on nicely and bunts it by his feet;
34.6;?;Starc to Taylor, no run bangs it in and it goes down leg. Taylor has zero interest in it;
34.5;1;Starc to Watling, 1 run full and outside off, drives sweetly through cover point;
34.4;1;Starc to Taylor, 1 run oooh, that's not the ball to his field, but there could still have been a run-out and the Lyon-Paine partnership bungles it! All of it starts with a simple back of a length ball outside off when Starc has his field for the pull and the fend away. Taylor exploits it with a punch through cover and Lyon goes chasing after it. Watling completes the first, then looks up, wondering if there's a second, Taylor commits from the other end, then stops, which leaves Watling way out of his crease. He really was a gonner but the throw comes on the bounce, too close to Paine who is running up to the stumps, and he can't gather it on the half-volley;
34.3;?;Starc to Taylor, no run another bouncer, but Starc slings it way down leg.;
34.2;?;Starc to Taylor, no run it was only a matter of time before he was gonna take it on and here he goes for the pull. The short ball, rising up towards his chest, zips past his gloves through to the keeper;
34.1;?;Starc to Taylor, no run digs it in and it soars over the ducking Taylor;
33.6;?;Cummins to Watling, no run in the off-stump corridor, perhaps just a tad shortish though. Watling has time to see it and block behind point;
33.5;?;Cummins to Watling, no run back of a length and outside off - a bit of variation, to see if Watling might go chasing, no such luck, not that kinda player.;
33.4;?;Cummins to Watling, no run nice and tight on the stumps again. Watling knows he needs to play and he does that well too - straight bat.;
33.3;?;Cummins to Watling, no run 134 kph, presses forward and defends the fuller delivery on middle;
33.2;?;Cummins to Watling, no run half an appeal for lbw and it's a lovely ball for it too. Might have been a nick though. Yep, HotSpot confirms it. Terrific stuff from Cummins though, hitting a fullish length on off stump and getting the pink ball to nip in off the seam. Watling brings down a straight bat but it's slightly outside the line of the ball because of its movement.;
33.1;?;Cummins to Watling, no run very straight and very full again to Watling, who nudges it to midwicket;
32.6;?;Starc to Taylor, no run 145kph, short and sliding down again, far enough that Taylor doesn't even have to dream about a shot;
32.5;?;Starc to Taylor, no run tries a flick, off the thigh pad and down to the keeper. Starc's revving it up to the 140 kph range and he's definitely looking to trap Taylor down the leg side;
32.4;?;Starc to Taylor, no run attacks the body again and Taylor works it off his hips to short leg;
32.3;?;Starc to Taylor, no run up at the splice of the bat! Taylor has to get off his feet to get on top of a very sharp short ball a shade outside off stump. Manages to block it in the end, but short leg and leg gully are waiting.;
32.2;1;Starc to Watling, 1 run leans forward - guess the feet move quite nicely soon after a double-hundred - and eases a full and wide delivery through point;
32.1;?;Starc to Watling, no run that low backlift comes in handy as Starc fires it up to the base of middle stump. Neat little flick from Watling, but the substitute Neser stops it diving to his right at mid-on;
31.6;4;Cummins to Taylor, FOUR runs too full and Taylor meets it with a firm push that beats mid-on and finds the boundary, giving New Zealand a bit of cheer at the end.;
31.5;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run swinging in late into the batsman, who gets a thick inside edge onto pad while going forward to push at the ball;
31.4;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run slips in the bouncer but he saw it coming and ducked safely under;
31.3;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run on the fifth stump and on a length, similar to the last ball, but he leaves it alone this time;
31.2;4;Cummins to Taylor, FOUR runs edged wide of second slip. good length in the channel, he was trying to steer it more square, but it takes the edge and goes in the gap between second slip and gully;
31.1;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run fuller on off, pushed to mid-on;
30.6;?;Starc to Watling, no run too far outside off and easily left alone;
30.5;?;Starc to Watling, no run quick and straight and full, but Watling gets solidly behind it and defends it back;
30.4;?;Starc to Watling, no run full length outside off, carries after pitching and Paine collects at chest height;
30.3;1;Starc to Taylor, 1 run short ball, but he takes him on, pulls him front of his helmet. Keeps it down though, and to fine leg;
30.2;2;Starc to Taylor, 2 runs back of a length and rises up outside off, but Taylor stays beside it, rises with it, and punches crisply through cover;
30.1;?;Starc to Taylor, no run length ball going across him on the fourth stump, Taylor slashes it into the ground and towards cover-point;
29.6;?;Cummins to Watling, no run full length on the sixth stump, and he lets it go;
29.5;?;Cummins to Watling, no run length ball on off, calmly defended on the front foot;
29.4;?;Cummins to Watling, no run yorker on off stump, digs it out to mid-on;
29.3;?;Cummins to Watling, no run zips through on a length, jagging in, but that is a good, confident leave;
29.2;?;Cummins to Watling, no run length ball in the channel, shoulders arms;
29.1;1;Cummins to Taylor, 1 run swinging into him, almost yorker length again but slightly down leg. Taylor is well set and he flicks it off his toes;
28.6;W;Starc to Wagner, OUT castled him first ball! Full swinging delivery that is too good for a nightwatchman. Might have been too good for a main batsman too. Swung in late, landed at his feet and snuck through to break the stumps. He was a bit late in bringing down his bat I suppose but that was just a great ball to a lower order batsman.;Neil Wagner b Starc 0 (2m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
28.5;W;Starc to Nicholls, OUT caught down the legside!. Starc was looking for that line, gave up a few runs off the last two balls, but this one was a bit straighter and Nicholls thought he was getting some more free runs, but he didn't make proper connection with the flick. Gets a thin touch that a gleeful Paine holds on to. Third wicket for Starc;Henry Nicholls c ?Paine b Starc 7 (30m 18b 0x4 0x6) SR: 38.88;
28.4;2;Starc to Nicholls, 2 runs strays down leg again and this time Nicholls times it even better while flicking it off his pads, but good work by Cummins running to his right at fine leg, sliding and stopping the ball cleanly;
28.3;2;Starc to Nicholls, 2 runs length ball straying down leg, flicked off the pads to fine leg's right;
28.2;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run full, hint of shaping away, he stays in his crease and defends solidly;
28.1;3;Starc to Taylor, 3 runs too short and doesn't really rise up, allows the batsman to stay beside the ball and cut it through cover-point;
27.6;?;Cummins to Nicholls, no run good length angling across him, but he's confident enough to shoulder arms to it;
27.5;1;Cummins to Taylor, 1 run good length, nipping into him, he moves inside the tucks it through square leg;
27.4;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run short, and he saw it early, went to pull but didn't get it off the meat of the bat, goes to short fine leg off the bottom half of the bat;
27.3;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run length on off, defended into the offside;
27.2;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run good length on off, gets behind it and defends to the bowler's right;
27.1;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run length ball, jags back in off the seam and hits him on the kneeroll and rolls into the offside;
26.6;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run zips past the outside edge. Good length and moving away from Nicholls, who's bat is drawn towards the ball. Labuschagne at short leg is appealing vociferously for it, he thinks he's heard something. But replays show there was no edge;
26.5;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run short ball, but on the fifth stump line this time so it's easier for Nicholls to sway out of the way;
26.4;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run tailing into him late, strikes pad and goes to short leg. He was trying to flick it, but missed;
26.3;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run fuller on the stumps, nudged to midwicket with a half-prod forward;
26.2;1;Starc to Taylor, 1 run that hung in the air! through backward short leg. Back of a length tucking him up, and he tried to keep it down but it was in a vacant area. Also raises fifty for Taylor. He's gutsed it out against some quality bowling;
26.1;?;Starc to Taylor, no run back of a length, outside leg stump, he tries to flick it, but misses, it's a little too far down leg;
25.6;1;Cummins to Taylor, 1 run fuller on the stumps, pushes it to point's right by opening the bat face;
25.5;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run through him. He was probably expecting a short one due to the leg gully having come in, but instead Cummins bluffed him with a length ball seaming in that went between bat and body;
25.4;?;Cummins to Taylor, no run back of a length and that one bounced a fair bit. Taylor was on the back foot and had to get his bat up a bit higher than anticipated to jab it down;
25.3;2;Cummins to Taylor, 2 runs fuller outside off, comes on the front foot and opens the bat face to run it through backward point;
25.2;1;Cummins to Nicholls, 1 run direct hit at the striker's end but Taylor might have made it in time. He had put in the dive, so was well in when the ball hit. This was a length ball, tucked to square leg and they hared across for a quick single;
25.1;1;Cummins to Taylor, 1 run back of a length, nipping into him but ends up on the legs. Taylor thought it would rise higher but it stayed near the thigh pad, and he adjusted well, slapping a pull to keep it down;
24.6;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run good length outside off, and it just takes off after landing. Paine collects it well over his head.;
24.5;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run length ball on the pads, turned to square leg;
24.4;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run superb bouncer, well on target, equally well played by arching well out of the way to let it pass through, and dropping wrists at the same time too;
24.3;1;Starc to Taylor, 1 run length ball on the stumps, tucked through midwicket;
24.2;2;Starc to Taylor, 2 runs almost a yorker on off stump, but not quite, which means he can off-drive this fluently past mid-off;
24.1;?;Starc to Taylor, no run back of a length on the stumps, goes up on his toes to pat it down;
23.6;?;Lyon to Nicholls, no run fuller on off, lunges out and blocks the ball;
23.5;2;Lyon to Nicholls, 2 runs tossed up, and he spots it early goes down and paddle-sweeps it fine.;
23.4;?;Lyon to Nicholls, no run length ball on the stumps, patted it down to backward short leg;
23.3;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run slightly shorter and outside off, he stays beside the ball and cuts past the lone slip;
23.2;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run fuller outside off, solidly defended on the front foot;
23.1;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run length ball, stays in his crease and goes back and across to punch towards mid-on;
22.6;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run back of a length ball tucking him up, patted down and short leg fields;
22.5;?;Starc to Nicholls, no run length ball on off, defended towards mid-on from the crease;
22.4;W;Starc to Williamson, OUT Smith takes a blinder at second slip. Quick ball by Starc, on a length and moving away and it draws a poke and an edge from Williamson. It was flying at pace but Smith went airborne and was horizontal to his right at full stretch while plucking the ball out of the air.;Kane Williamson c Smith b Starc 34 (102m 70b 7x4 0x6) SR: 48.57;
22.3;?;Starc to Williamson, no run beauty Pitches on a length and nips across, just enough to snake past the outside edge. Williamson keeps bat close to body and plays late, which means it didn't take the edge.;
22.2;1;Starc to Taylor, 1 run length ball, pushes at it in front of his body a bit but with soft hands in the direction of cover and they take a quick single;
22.1;?;Starc to Taylor, no run oooh, he just wore that ball on the thigh pad. Back of a length and Taylor seemed like he read it late, or lost it, and ended up staying still in his crease. Tried to play a flick very late, by then the ball thudded into thigh pad and rolled off;
21.6;4;Lyon to Williamson, FOUR runs quicker one darted across him, pitches and holds its line, Williamson gets a healthy edge while trying to steer it, and finds four to third man.;
21.5;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run length on off, defended;
21.4;?;Lyon to Williamson, no run length on middle, turning to leg, he transfers weight back and clips it to short fine leg;
21.3;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run fuller on off, drives to mid-off on the front foot;
21.2;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run length ball on off, turning into him, goes well back and turns it around the corner. But short fine leg is in place;
21.1;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run fuller on the stumps, patted back down the pitch on the front foot;
20.6;?;Starc to Williamson, no run back of a length on off, stays still and defends to point;
20.5;?;Starc to Williamson, no run good bouncer again, but Kane saw it early and arched his back out of the way;
20.4;?;Starc to Williamson, no run fuller on the stumps, defended towards gully;
20.3;?;Starc to Williamson, no run oooh nice one. Short ball and very close to the batsman, forced him to attempt to play at it, but Williamson dropped his wrists in time after first rising to meet the ball and allowed it to go past him;
20.2;?;Starc to Williamson, no run fuller and slightly closer to off stump, but he knows where his off stump is and can leave comfortably;
20.1;?;Starc to Williamson, no run length ball angling across, lets it go through in the channel;
19.6;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run good length again, dipping down, he comes on the front foot and clips to mid-on, without quite getting to the pitch of the ball;
19.5;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run fuller, dipping on him outside off, defended with a straight bat on the front foot;
19.4;1;Lyon to Williamson, 1 run good length spinning into him, he waits for it and uses his wrists and timing to expertly flick it through square leg;
19.3;1;Lyon to Taylor, 1 run length again, but straighter this time so Taylor can go back and tuck it past the man close in;
19.2;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run length ball, turning sharply into him, pats it down to backward short leg;
19.1;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run length on off, turning in, gets behind it and punches to the bowler's right;
18.6;2;Starc to Williamson, 2 runs another lovely drive. Low full toss outside off and he punch-drives through extra cover. Wade's haring after it and pulls it back in before the boundary;
18.5;?;Starc to Williamson, no run length on the stumps, stays in his crease and tucks it to square leg;
18.4;?;Starc to Williamson, no run length outside off, left alone;
18.3;?;Starc to Williamson, no run ripper. Even Williamson can't do anything about that. Swung in, pitched on a length and straightened. Misses the outside edge by millimetres;
18.2;4;Starc to Williamson, FOUR runs sumptuous. Full outside off and he leans into the cover drive oh so easily;
18.1;?;Starc to Williamson, no run back of a length in the channel, he lets it go. Paine cops it on the tip of the gloves and that's hurt him.;
17.6;1;Lyon to Williamson, 1 run tossed up, but he meets it with a confident stride and picks it off through midwicket;
17.5;1b;Lyon to Taylor, 1 bye too far down leg and beats Paine too, so they get a bye;
17.4;2;Lyon to Taylor, 2 runs gets this to drift across and Taylor gets a thick outside edge to third man while prodding forward.;
17.3;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run length ball, goes well back and punches to midwicket;
17.2;2;Lyon to Taylor, 2 runs fuller, there for the drive and he executes it well. A diving cover gets a hand to it to slow it down bu they get a single;
17.1;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run angling across him from around the wicket. Length ball, chopped towards cover;
16.6;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run fuller coming into him again, clipped to square leg;
16.5;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run bouncer, but misdirected down leg, too short, and easy to duck under;
16.4;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run back of a length around off, Williamson hops across and keeps it down;
16.3;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run length on off, defended with an angled bat towards point;
16.2;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run fuller and closer to off, tailing into him, defended to point;
16.1;4;Cummins to Williamson, FOUR runs length ball in the channel, but Williamson is just masterful at this. Waits on it, plays it later than anyone else, just opens the face of the bat and finds the backward point boundary. So few people who could have hit that ball for four;
15.6;4;Lyon to Taylor, FOUR runs he's back and late cutting just past slip! He kept it down, he got a little close to it as it turned back but controlled it past slip and it ran away;
15.5;4;Lyon to Taylor, FOUR runs down the track again and slicing this inside out over mid off! It was well over him this time. Didn't nail it but got enough of it;
15.4;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run flatter on off, he defends;
15.3;4;Lyon to Taylor, FOUR runs advances and thumps it flat and just wide of a diving mid off! What a shot. Skipped out and thumped it flat against the turn. But the substitute Neser wasn't far away with the dive! It rocketed to the fence;
15.2;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run pushed through wide of off, he leaves;
15.1;?;Lyon to Taylor, no run almost pops to bat pad! This spun sharply from outside off, comes off inside edge onto pad and pops up straight of a diving Labuschagne;
14.6;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run 138kph, good length, top of off, he defends neatly from the crease;
14.5;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run 140kph, good length, fifth stump line, he leaves on line and length;
14.4;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run 134kph, back of a length outside off, he stands tall and pushes off the back foot to point;
14.3;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run back of a length outside off, he's back and chopping this down off the splice;
14.2;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run 137kph, it rises off a length and hits him in the groin! That did not tickle. He toughs it out though;
14.1;?;Cummins to Williamson, no run 138kph, back of a length, fourth stump, he's rising on his toes to defend to cover;
