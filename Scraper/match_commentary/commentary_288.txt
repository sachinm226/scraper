4.20pm Play for today has been called off. We are expecting to start at 10am tomorrow. So see you then
4pm It is still raining. I have no hopes of further play
Jarrod: "Its starting to rain here in Brisbane as well, I'd say that's a bad sign if anything."
3.35pm "Well it's midnight here in S.Aus, and that means that if my name was that weird Cindy person, rather than that crazy John man, my car would be turning into a lemon, rather than a Le Mans... Goodnight all"
Goodnight, Earl John. It is still raining. Prospects for play getting bleaker and bleaker
3.20pm Still raining. Those asking me for a Steyn update: he is ruled out of bowling in this innings, and will take a fitness test before the start of the second. For those in Australia, it might not be a bad idea to not keep waiting
3pm The early tea break has come and gone. It is still raining in Cape Town
2.40pm They have taken an early tea. The rain is slowing down. Don't expect an update in the next 20 minutes
2.30pm The Table is not visible. This is horizontal sideways rain
2.23pm Now the rain has got heavier. People are heading for cover. I can imagine trains back to town are filling up
2.21pm Raining away. A huge struggle out there to keep the covers on. A very fine drizzle but a very heavy wind
"At what point do teams get a third DRS review? SA already missed with Warner LBW and Watson LBW in this innings. Why were they allowed to review Johnson" Quinn, reviews are reset at the end of 80 overs
2.18pm Looks like the rain has stopped. The umpires are back on the ground
2.15pm The rain has got stronger. And players are coming off. Duminy will have to wait for his hat-trick ball
The wind is making it a nightmare for the ground staff. It is carrying away the covers, and the people holding those covers
127.4;4;Philander to Harris, FOUR runs top edge. Harris wants to pull this, the bouncer gets big on him, and flies over AB's head;
127.3;?;Philander to Harris, no run on a length, shaping away, defended off the front foot;
127.2;?;Philander to Harris, no run Harris defends a length ball outside off;
127.1;1;Philander to Clarke, 1 run short of a length, seaming in, hits the inside half of the bat, concedes a single;
126.6;W;Duminy to Johnson, OUT wide down leg, they ask for a stumping. He is actually asking for a catch down leg, and they have reviewed it. This is down leg, Johnson looks to flick it, seems he has missed it, but Duminy is adamant they review this. Smith is not on the field, but AB listens to Duminy and goes for it. There is a smidgeon on the inside edge as the ball passes the bat. There is a register on the snicko too. And he is gone. Duminy on a hat-trick;Mitchell Johnson c ?de Villiers b Duminy 0 (4m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
126.5;W;Duminy to Haddin, OUT he is caught by Amla's arm pit. Haddin wants to clear mid-off, but has got too close to the ball, hitting it flat towards mid-off. Amla fumbles it, but the ball is stuck in his armpit. First stand of less than 50;Brad Haddin c Amla b Duminy 13 (33m 21b 2x4 0x6) SR: 61.9;
126.4;1;Duminy to Clarke, 1 run looks to go over cover, gets only the outside half of the bat to it. Fielded at deep point;

126.2;1;Duminy to Haddin, 1 run short of a length, punched away to deep cover;
126.1;1;Duminy to Clarke, 1 run short of a length, taken from outside off, nudged into the leg side, gets a single;
125.6;1;Philander to Clarke, 1 run short of a length, middle and leg, worked away for a single;
125.5;?;Philander to Clarke, no run another bouncer, this is straighter, and has been left alone. Two bouncers for the over done;

125.3;1;Philander to Haddin, 1 run pulled away in the air, but it doesn't carry to deep midwicket;
125.2;?;Philander to Haddin, no run bouncer, down the leg side, no need to play at it;
125.1;4;Philander to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin welcomes him with a swipe first ball. It is not the best of hits, but is wide enough of mid-on for four;
124.6;1;Duminy to Haddin, 1 run short and wide, punched away to sweeper-cover;
124.5;?;Duminy to Haddin, no run pushed across wide again, and left alone;

123.6;1;Abbott to Clarke, 1 run clipped away off the pads for a single;
123.5;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run misses out on this leg-side length ball, and is hit on the pad;
123.4;2;Abbott to Clarke, 2 runs beautiful shot. Punched on the up, to the left of cover. This is not a half-volley by any means;
123.3;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run short of a length, angling in, defended off the front foot;
123.2;4;Abbott to Clarke, FOUR runs short, outside off, Clarke drags that pull over midwicket to cross 150. Raises the bat to his galler, and then shakes Haddin's hand, and acknowledges the crowd;
123.1;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run short of a length, outside off, pushed to cover;
122.6;?;Duminy to Haddin, no run flighted on middle and leg, driven back at him;
122.5;?;Duminy to Haddin, no run short of a length, stays back to defend;
122.4;?;Duminy to Haddin, no run flatter, looks to run it past backward point. Can't beat the man;
122.3;?;Duminy to Haddin, no run this is the drifter, moves towards off after pitching middle and leg. Defended back;
122.2;?;Duminy to Haddin, no run flighted, middle and leg, gets a leading edge towards mid-off;
122.1;4;Duminy to Haddin, FOUR runs Haddin taking up from where Watson left. Moves across, reaches the pitch of the length ball, and slogs him over midwicket. Somehow Haddin's slogs are also stylish;
121.6;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run defends this length ball off the front foot;
121.5;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run short of a length, just outside off, punched to mid-off;
121.4;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run on a length, outside off, defended with an open face;
121.3;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run short of a length, angling in, defended from the crease;

120.3;?;Duminy to Clarke, no run defended to leg;
120.2;?;Duminy to Clarke, no run short of a length, flat, dabbed to short third man;
120.1;2;Duminy to Clarke, 2 runs on a length, on the pads, worked away to deep square. A suicidal second ensues. Haddin has given up as Philander goes to his end. The throw misses, but I don't see an attempt from Duminy to stand behind the stumps and try to collect it;
119.6;?;Abbott to Haddin, no run on a length, angling in, defended off the back foot;
119.5;?;Abbott to Haddin, no run full, just outside off, Haddin stays back to defend;

119.3;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run short of a length, angling in, punched to midwicket;
119.2;4;Abbott to Clarke, FOUR runs just play and admire. This is a wide full ball, and Clarke - who has absorbed a lot of dots from Abbott this morning - leans into the drive, and crashes it past cover. Not a soul moves;
119.1;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run on a length, just outside off, holds its line. Defended with an open face;
118.6;1;Duminy to Clarke, 1 run down the wicket to drive this to long-on;
118.5;?;Duminy to Clarke, no run defends this to cover;
118.4;W;Duminy to Watson, OUT Watson's whacking is over. No it is not. This is a no-ball, I think. Or maybe not. They are still checking it. He is given. Watson tries to go over long-off, mis-hits it, is caught at long-off. Replays show Duminy might have just that smidgeon behind the line;Shane Watson c Amla b Duminy 40 (50m 32b 2x4 3x6) SR: 125;
118.3;6;Duminy to Watson, SIX runs that's a biggie. Into the brewery, almost. Plays the sweep, makes no attempt to keep it down. And it has gone into the breeze, but clears square leg with ease. Another fifty stand. Five of them now;
118.2;1;Duminy to Clarke, 1 run down the wicket to push this to midwicket;
118.1;1;Duminy to Watson, 1 run shortish, wide, cut away;
117.6;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run on a length, angling in, defended to leg;
117.5;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run looks to drive a length ball on the up, Abbott sticks out his left hand to field;

115.6;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run another maiden for Abbott as this one seams in from short of a length;
115.5;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run forward he comes to defend this;
115.4;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run short of gully. Abbott has drawn edges there in the morning too. This one holds its line outside off, Clarke goes with hard hands, gets a regulation edge, but it doesn't carry;
115.3;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run on a length, angling in, defended back to him;
115.2;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run short of a length, outside off, runs off the outside half to gully;
115.1;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run short of a length, just outside off, Clarke defends;
114.6;?;Duminy to Watson, no run pushes this length ball towards short cover;
114.5;4;Duminy to Watson, FOUR runs four this time. Watson wants to go long-on this time, but ends up slicing this towards long-off. Amla has to run to his right, but has time only to get a finger-tip to it;
114.4;6;Duminy to Watson, SIX runs Watson in deadly mood. Plants the front foot down, and slogs this length ball from wide outside off to take six over midwicket;
114.3;?;Duminy to Watson, no run shimmies down the defend this;
114.2;?;Duminy to Watson, no run on middle and leg, defended back to him;
114.1;?;Duminy to Watson, no run flighted on off, defended back to him;
113.6;1;Elgar to Watson, 1 run driven to Philander at long-off for a single;
113.5;6;Elgar to Watson, SIX runs Philander is late to pick it. Watson tries to loft this, ends up slicing it towards long-off, but Philander has not moved to his right right early enough. This has gone for six but he would have caught it had he moved soon enough;
113.4;1;Elgar to Clarke, 1 run flat, into the pads, worked away for one;
113.3;?;Elgar to Clarke, no run nice solid forward-defensive;

112.1;?;Duminy to Clarke, no run length ball outside off, left alone;
111.6;1;Elgar to Clarke, 1 run down the wicket to drive this to long-off;
111.5;4;Elgar to Clarke, FOUR runs shouts of catch it as Clarke smashes this uppishly into the cover region, and sends it past cover;

110.4;3;Morkel to Watson, 3 runs uppish as he pushes hard at a length ball, but gets it straight of midwicket for runs;
110.3;?;Morkel to Watson, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
110.2;4;Morkel to Watson, FOUR runs plays the late upper-cut. Similar delivery to the one that he pulled out of last over, but goes ahead this time, and sends it over gully;
110.1;1;Morkel to Clarke, 1 run on a length, into the pads, pushed wide of mid-on for one;
109.6;?;Elgar to Watson, no run flatter, punched towards cover;

109.4;1;Elgar to Clarke, 1 run short of a length, on off, worked behind square for one;
109.3;1;Elgar to Watson, 1 run driven to deep cover for one;
109.2;1;Elgar to Clarke, 1 run driven to deep midwicket for one this time;
109.1;?;Elgar to Clarke, no run down the wicket, the ball straightens a touch, he defends. Actually he has got this pad-first. They would have got him had they reviewed this one;
108.6;?;Morkel to Watson, no run looks to cut this shortish delivery, is beaten by the extra bounce;
108.5;?;Morkel to Watson, no run on a length, angling in, defended back to him;

108.2;?;Morkel to Watson, no run short of a length, defended;
108.1;2;Morkel to Watson, 2 runs full, on the pads, clipped away, Watson nearly runs himself out looking for a non-existent third. The throw from deep square is quite high, and AB decides to throw it onto the stumps. Misses. That throw would have beaten Watson's dive;
107.6;1;Elgar to Watson, 1 run and he slips in an arm ball first up. They are reviewing a not-out on the lbw. Pitches short of a length, outside off, but comes back in sharply even as Watson tries to cut. This hits the back pad first, goes on to hit the bat, and would have taken the off ball, but Watson is outside the line. The on-field call stays, but surprisingly Dharmasena is pointing to the glove. Now does this become a run? Yes it does. And closer replays suggest there is no pad involved. Hits the glove on the way to the bat;
107.5;W;Elgar to Smith, OUT oh played on. Smith misses out on a ton, and this is one of the filthiest balls that will get you a Test wicket. A long hop, a wide one at that, but it stays low, doesn't quite come on, and takes the bottom edge onto the stumps;Steven Smith b Elgar 84 (214m 155b 9x4 3x6) SR: 54.19;
107.4;?;Elgar to Smith, no run flighted on off, dug out to cover;

105.3;2;Elgar to Clarke, 2 runs on a length, into the pads, nurdled behind square on the leg side. With no one fielding there, AB has to do the collecting;
105.2;?;Elgar to Clarke, no run flat again, outside off, Clarke tries the late cut, but can't beat point;
105.1;?;Elgar to Clarke, no run flat into the pads, Clarke misses out on it;
104.6;?;Morkel to Smith, no run and back to leaving it alone outside off as Morkel pitches short;
104.6;5nb;Morkel to Smith, (no ball) FOUR runs lovely shot. Sensational batting from Smith. He has been lofting Morkel over the infield today. Not easy to do. This time he gets under a length ball, and clears mid-on. Holds that high-elbow pose for the photographers. No-ball too;
104.5;1;Morkel to Clarke, 1 run goes back to short of a length, is tucked away behind square;
104.4;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run tries that yorker on leg to see if Clarke it moving across too early. Bowled at 144ks, but Clarke is covering the stumps. This one misses leg;
104.3;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run oh that awkward delivery. Short, now getting higher than the chest, and there is no room either, because this is going over middle. Clarke has to hurry into getting inside its line and evading it;
104.2;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run short of a length now, angling towards off, defended from the crease. Keeps it down;
104.1;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run bowls the bouncer, Clarke gets under it;

103.2;?;Elgar to Clarke, no run shortish again, cut away square this time, and Morkel saves runs at point with a dive;
103.1;1;Elgar to Smith, 1 run short from Elgar, punched away to deep midwicket;
102.6;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run and he he bowls a bouncer that is easy to leave;
102.6;2nb;Morkel to Smith, (no ball) 1 run short of a length, nudged away into the leg side for one. That no-ball means Morkel gets Clarke for one delivery;
102.5;?;Morkel to Smith, no run bouncer this time, 143ks, Smith gets under it. Morkel has now gone two overs without getting to bowl to Clarke;
102.4;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length, accurate, Smith defends in front of off;
102.3;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length again, and Smith lets it go again;
102.2;?;Morkel to Smith, no run another shortish delivery outside off, another leave. AB collects overhead;
102.1;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length, quite quick, 144ks, left alone just outside off;
101.6;2;Elgar to Clarke, 2 runs down the wicket to work this flattish delivery behind square on the leg side. Gets a couple;

101.2;1;Elgar to Clarke, 1 run short of a length, and Clarke rocks back to cut it to deep cover;
101.1;?;Elgar to Clarke, no run flat delivery, gets some turn from middle and leg. Defended;
100.6;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
100.5;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length, pretty straight, defended back to him;
100.4;6;Morkel to Smith, SIX runs Smith is in some mood here. Morkel has been hitting people all over the body since PE, but here Smith gets under a length ball, and lofts it over mid-off. All the way for a six. Into the wind, mind you;
100.3;?;Morkel to Smith, no run short of a length, outside off, gets good bounce, and he has left alone;
100.2;?;Morkel to Smith, no run down the leg again, and Smith lets out a cry of anguish as he misses out on it again;
100.1;?;Morkel to Smith, no run begins with one down leg, Smith misses out on it, Morkel is excited about a catch at the wicket, but he has not hit it. The ball kisses the pad on the way;
99.6;4;Philander to Clarke, FOUR runs whipped away. Another half-volley from Philander. On the pads too. And he has hammered this between mid-on and short midwicket;
99.5;4;Philander to Clarke, FOUR runs nearly out for a baby hundred. This is just short of a driving length, on off, holds its line, takes the edge, but it dies well in short of Smith at second slip;
99.4;?;Philander to Clarke, no run left alone outside off. Time to concentrate again;
99.3;4;Philander to Clarke, FOUR runs there it is. Twenty-five balls after reaching 99. Clarke has his No. 27. He has been hit, felled, tortured with this wait on 99, but he is still standing. This is a long half-volley, a gift he has been waiting for, and he drives it past cover. Removes the helmet, raises his hurt arms, accepts the applause, and kisses the badge on the helmet. Morkel is applauding too;
99.2;1;Philander to Smith, 1 run bangs this in, puled to deep midwicket;
99.1;6;Philander to Smith, SIX runs meanwhile Smith keeps getting the runs to keep the pressure off his captain. Lovely straight drive. Just that it is in the air. Takes from around off, and lofts it back over the Big Vern's head;
98.6;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run half-volley, driven nicely, straight to mid-off. Another "wait on". Twenty-four balls on 99;
98.5;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run this one seams in from just outside off, he defends solidly. He has nearly got a quarter-Cowan on 99;
98.4;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run pitches this up, a touch wide, the sucker ball, Clarke drives, but still cannot beat point. This is great tension;
98.3;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run on a length, angling in towards off, pushed to off. Another NO. Make that 21 balls on 99;
98.2;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run wide length ball, Clarke doesn't go after it. Twenty balls on 99;
98.1;1;Abbott to Smith, 1 run short of a length, into the pads, Abbot has finally conceded a run this morning;
97.6;?;Philander to Clarke, no run make that 19. Short of a length, outside off, shaping away, left alone;

97.3;?;Philander to Smith, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
97.2;2;Philander to Smith, 2 runs too straight, clipped off the pads for a couple;
97.1;4;Philander to Smith, FOUR runs this should take some pressure off Clarke at the other end. Wide half-volley, he pushes into the drive without any foot movement, and places this between mid-off and cover;
96.6;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run leaves this one alone to make it 18 balls on 99. Abbott's spell this morning: 5-5-0-0;
96.5;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run on a length, angling in, pushed towards mid-on, and another loud shout of "NO";
96.4;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run Faf du Plessis keeps him on 99. Clarke throws his hands at a shortish delivery, and du Plessis makes a diving save at gully to his left;
96.3;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run wide length ball, left alone;
96.2;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run short of a length, on off, defended from the crease;
96.1;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run on a length, just outside off, holds its line, defended with an open face;
95.6;?;Philander to Smith, no run another leave outside off, but this one seams back in. Not enough to threaten the stumps, though;
95.5;?;Philander to Smith, no run another good leave. Smith has read this one is not going to move in, and leaves it alone outside off;
95.4;?;Philander to Smith, no run on a length, outside off, another good solid leave;
95.3;?;Philander to Smith, no run length ball outside off, left alone. Good carry there. AB collects it chest high;
95.2;?;Philander to Smith, no run on a length, on off, holds its line, defended from the crease;
95.1;4;Philander to Smith, FOUR runs full and straight, too full in fact, and Smith whips it away, between short midwicket and square leg;
94.6;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run solid front-foot defensive. A loud and clear call of "NO". Clarke has faced 12 balls on 99;
94.5;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run oh what a leave. Nearly bowled on 99. South Africa can't believe how this missed. There are hands around mouths. Just short of a length, just outside off, and left lone. This one seams back appreciably, and goes over the middle stumps. Perhaps misses it by six inches;
94.4;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run good carry from just short of a length and outside off. Left alone;
94.3;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run accurate, on a length, middle and off. Defended to the right of mid-on, and more nervy calling. Clarke starts running but shouts out, "Wait." Smith is nearly half way up before going back;

94.1;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run on a length, outside off, left alone as it holds its line;
93.6;2;Philander to Smith, 2 runs Smith adds to his overnight score after 20 dots. This one holds its line just outside off, takes a thick outside edge, goes past point;

93.4;?;Philander to Smith, no run on a length, on off, defended to cover;
93.3;?;Philander to Smith, no run loose shot. These last 10 minutes have been nervy. Smith is yet to score today. Smith doesn't move feet, and tries to drive. Beaten;
93.2;?;Philander to Smith, no run slight shape away from just outside off. Smith defends off the back foot;
93.1;?;Philander to Smith, no run short of a length, on off, defended from the crease;
92.6;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run and nearly a catch. This is a loose push outside off, gets the edge, it doesn't carry to gully where Elgar makes a diving save to keep him on 99;
92.5;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run Smith is nearly run out. Clarke's calling is nervous. He punches to point. "Wait, wait, yeah, wait." Nearly sells Smith down the river. Would have been run out despite the dive had the throw hit;
92.4;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
92.3;?;Abbott to Clarke, no run on a length, down leg, Clarke would have dearly loved to get a touch, but he doesn't;

91.2;4;Philander to Clarke, FOUR runs half-volley on the pads, Clarke loves it, clips it off the toes, beats mid-on to his right. Two short of a hundred now;

90.3;?;Abbott to Smith, no run short of a length, gets good bounce, towards the high part of the bat as Smith defends;
90.2;?;Abbott to Smith, no run nearly played on as Smith looks to punch this shortish delivery away. The ball comes on slowly, takes the inside edge, and rolls towards square leg;
90.1;?;Abbott to Smith, no run wide on the crease, middle and off, angling down, beats the inside edge, appeals loudly, but it is clearly headed down leg;

88.3;?;Abbott to Smith, no run fuller, closer to off, defended off the front foot;
88.2;?;Abbott to Smith, no run slight shape away from outside off, but it starts too short and too wide to make him commit to it;
88.1;?;Abbott to Smith, no run starts short of a length, 133ks, wide, and there is no need to play it;
87.6;?;Philander to Clarke, no run full and straight, defended to mid-on to take Australia safely through to the end of a day they have dominated;

87.1;4;Philander to Clarke, FOUR runs full, outside off, he drives with an open face, beats point, but he also grimaces with that painful thumb;
86.6;?;Morkel to Smith, no run on a length, outside off, left alone;
86.5;4;Morkel to Smith, FOUR runs and is ramped away first ball with that new angle. This is short, angling in, at 145ks, and Smith arches back to make room, and sends it over the slips cordon. What a way to get to fifty;
86.4;5;Morkel to Clarke, 5 runs Clarke takes a risky single to get off the strike as he fends this towards cover and charges off. Amla tries to run him out but ends up conceding four overthrows;
86.3;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run dug in short, Clarke fends this in front of his face, and is hit on the thumb. The right thumb. He has called for attention immediately;

84.5;2;Morkel to Clarke, 2 runs and he draws a top edge immediately. Short, on off, Clarke wants to pull, but this is head high, and has no control on the pull. Except that it doesn't carry to the man running towards deep square leg;

84.3;?;Morkel to Clarke, no run stays back to punch this length ball, but can't beat point. Australia in a mood to dominate against the new ball that travels better;

84.1;4;Morkel to Clarke, FOUR runs short, outside off, sits up, and Clarke gets a measure of retribution as he dismissively pulls Morkel through midwicket for four;

Twenty minutes to go to stumps
 Innings Start
5.28pm A superb bowling performance from Australia. Johnson and Harris were excellent. Pattinson and Watson were not bad as support. They have taken a 207-run lead, but the follow-on won't be enforced. David Warner and Chris Rogers seen rushing back. When we come back, they will have about 22 minutes to bat before stumps
82.5;W;Pattinson to Morkel, OUT and Watson takes another good first-slip catch. Australia have taken a 207-run lead. Warner and Rogers run off. So no follow-on. A touch too ambitious from Morkel as he tries to punch this shortish delivery, gets a healthy edge that Watson takes to his left at first slip;Morne Morkel c Watson b Pattinson 7 (8m 9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 77.77;
82.4;?;Pattinson to Morkel, no run pitched up on off, driven hard back at him, Pattinson fields in the follow-through;
82.3;4;Pattinson to Morkel, FOUR runs pulled away. This is a soft short ball, sits up, on middle and leg, and he has smacked it over short midwicket. Follow-on target under in single digits;
82.3;3nb;Pattinson to Morkel, (no ball) 2 runs whipped away off the hip. Gets a couple through midwicket. What's more? It is a no-ball too;
82.2;?;Pattinson to Morkel, no run that's punched straight into Philander. Morkel denied runs by his partner. This is short and wide, he flat-bats it down the ground, but Philander can't get out of the way;
82.1;?;Pattinson to Morkel, no run short of a length, middle and off, Morkel is off his feet as he fends this back;
81.6;1;Johnson to Morkel, 1 run and that's the over negotiated. Tucked away off the hip. He keeps strike too;
81.5;?;Johnson to Morkel, no run short again, but misdirects it, and Morkel will be relieved it's down the leg side;
81.4;?;Johnson to Morkel, no run short of a length, towards the rib, he defends with an open face;
81.3;W;Johnson to Steyn, OUT it takes Johnson three deliveries with the new ball. Steyn's courageous effort comes to an end. Dug in short again, this time there is no width available, so Steyn fends at it while backing away. Gets a thick edge to first slip. Steyn walks off to a big ovation;Dale Steyn c Watson b Johnson 28 (38m 27b 5x4 0x6) SR: 103.7;
81.2;4;Johnson to Steyn, FOUR runs Steyn is lashing them here. This is a really brave effort. This is short, almost chest-high, not too wide, but the upper-cuts it for four over point;
81.1;?;Johnson to Steyn, no run short of a length, just outside off, defends well;
80.6;?;Harris to Philander, no run on a length, on off, gets extra bounce, hits the higher part of the bat;

79.4;?;Johnson to Steyn, no run short of a length, into the ribs, he manages to keep it down;
79.3;?;Johnson to Steyn, no run no fast bowlers' union here. Johnson bowls a bouncer here, Steyn cannot avoid it and is hit on the lid as this doesn't get up. Steyn is a tough son of a gun. He is smiling as he removes the helmet, and asks for a new one. Right at the badge it hits;
79.2;4;Johnson to Steyn, FOUR runs that's a fiery delivery. At 146ks. Rising towards the chest. Steyn can't get out of its way. Just too quick. Takes the shoulder of the bat, and flies over the cordon. Clarke applauds;
79.1;?;Johnson to Steyn, no run short, just outside off, Steyn stays away from its line. Bowled at 143ks, Oh hello, Johnson is feeling his hamstring as he walks back;
78.6;?;Harris to Philander, no run left alone outside off as this holds its line. New ball one over away;
78.5;?;Harris to Philander, no run that's a Cowan for Philander as he defends a full ball outside off;
78.4;1;Harris to Steyn, 1 run more runs as he hangs his bat to this shortish delivery, guides it past gully;
78.3;2;Harris to Steyn, 2 runs tries to go aerial this time, manages to clear mid-off with the mis-hit, has to run 44 yards;
78.2;4;Harris to Steyn, FOUR runs take that. Steyn is fighting hard here. Taking out all his pent-up bowling anger on this ball here. On a length, just outside off, and he has driven this straight of mid-off for four. Follow-on target under 30;
78.1;1;Harris to Philander, 1 run short of a length, angling in, worked away for one;
77.6;?;Watson to Steyn, no run this one swings away from just outside off, Steyn defends from the crease, gets a soft outside edge;
77.5;?;Watson to Steyn, no run Watson pitches this up, Steyn half-backs away, but defends it successfully in front of off;
77.4;4;Watson to Steyn, FOUR runs cracking shot. Not bad for one with a bad hammie. Stands tall, drives this length ball on the up, sends it between cover and short cover;
77.3;?;Watson to Steyn, no run full, really full, nearly a yorker, dug out to cover-point;
77.2;?;Watson to Steyn, no run short of a length, wide, left alone;

75.5;?;Watson to Steyn, no run fuller now, swinging into the pads, defended towards mid-on;
75.4;4;Watson to Steyn, FOUR runs smack that. Short, wide, and Steyn stands tall to cut this over point. Slightly in front, actually. Follow-on under 40 away;
75.3;?;Watson to Steyn, no run short of a length, slightly wide, Steyn looks to force it through the off side, but the tail-back hits the inside half of the bat;
75.2;?;Watson to Steyn, no run on a length, swinging in towards off, but Steyn is alert to it, and pushes this to mid-off;
75.1;?;Watson to Steyn, no run another bouncer to Steyn. A clear plan. Too short, though, and he ducks under it;
74.6;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run short of a length, outside off, stays low, beats the inside edge;
74.5;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run short of a length, he tries to cut, but it is not wide enough, and he ends up sending this back to him;
74.4;3;Pattinson to Steyn, 3 runs and now the full ball, Steyn is forward to it, and drives it down the ground. Mid-on makes a diving save, but they get three runs. Steyn has run three. They will hope he is not damaging the hammie with this running. This was a proper scramble;

74.2;?;Pattinson to Steyn, no run bouncer, angling down leg, Steyn ducks under it;
74.1;1;Pattinson to Philander, 1 run the ball is still reversing, goes off the inside edge, Steyn jogs through for a single;
73.6;W;Watson to Abbott, OUT Watson strikes even as Australia await the new ball. This is a perfect delivery. This is short of a length, lands just outside off, but doesn't go with the angle, which Abbott has covered perfectly. Top of off has been hit. Timbaaaah;Kyle Abbott b Watson 3 (29m 25b 0x4 0x6) SR: 12;
73.5;?;Watson to Abbott, no run that's a mean bouncer. This one trails him as he sways away. Then he has to arch even more to avoid it;
73.4;?;Watson to Abbott, no run short of a length, seams in, he is right behind it in defence;
73.3;?;Watson to Abbott, no run full, swinging in, driven nicely, but can't beat mid-on;

73.1;?;Watson to Abbott, no run on a length, on off, defended from the crease;
72.6;?;Smith to Philander, no run tossed up high, dug out towards mid-on, a Smith scramble to his right means they don't take the single;
72.5;?;Smith to Philander, no run slightly short, he goes back to cut it, but can't beat point;
72.4;1;Smith to Abbott, 1 run half-volley this time, Abbott plays a confident drive, wide of mid-off, gets a single;

72.2;?;Smith to Abbott, no run tossed up on off, defended back to him;
72.1;1;Smith to Philander, 1 run nice legbreak, pitches middle, turning away, pushed wide of cover. Abbott has negotiated a hostile over from Johnson. Now he has Smith;

71.3;?;Johnson to Abbott, no run pushes in the fuller one, outside off, beats his edge by a long way;
71.2;?;Johnson to Abbott, no run beauty from Johnson. Short of a length, rising towards the chest, Abbott fends, and is lucky to not edge it;
71.1;1;Johnson to Philander, 1 run slower ball, middle and leg, on a length, at 127ks, dropped into the covers for a single. No shielding of Abbott here;
70.6;?;Harris to Abbott, no run defended outside off as Harris pitches this up;
70.5;?;Harris to Abbott, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
70.4;2;Harris to Abbott, 2 runs swinging in, but it turns out to be a low full toss on the pads, which he nudges past leg gully for a couple. Follow-on target under 50 now;
70.3;?;Harris to Abbott, no run slightly short of a length, nips back in, hits his thigh pad;
70.2;?;Harris to Abbott, no run half a shout as this one swings in from middle and off, but it is headed down leg;
70.1;?;Harris to Abbott, no run that's a dangerous leave. Not too far outside off, he lets it go, the ball comes back in, goes where the fifth stump would have been;
69.6;?;Johnson to Philander, no run another teasing delivery outside off but Philander lets this one go;
69.5;?;Johnson to Philander, no run wide length ball, a rare loose slash at it. A break in concentration. He is lucky he hasn't edged this;

68.3;?;Harris to Philander, no run full, right forward to defend this back;
68.2;?;Harris to Philander, no run digs one in short, but too far outside off to make him do anything with it;
68.1;?;Harris to Philander, no run Philander right behind this as a shortish delivery is pitched just outside off;
67.6;?;Johnson to Abbott, no run and there he pitches one up looking for the edge. Difference between Mitch and Morne right there. This one swings away to miss the edge. What a superb over. Creates a wicket out of nowhere;

67.4;?;Johnson to Abbott, no run short of a length, around off, leaves him a touch, he stays inside the line of it;
67.3;?;Johnson to Abbott, no run Johnson is sharp and at him. Rising towards the chest, at 150ks. Manages to keep it down, but this is not the welcome you want;
67.2;W;Johnson to du Plessis, OUT Faf's vigil ends. Johnson has produced the magic. They check a no-ball, but Australia need not be nervous. He is fine with his front foot. On a length, outside off, goes away with the shine, du Plessis plays the rare loose shot, driving away from the body, gets a thick edge, which Warner grabs low at gully. Huge huge wicket with 54 still to avoid the follow-on, and Steyn not sure to bat;Faf du Plessis c Warner b Johnson 67 (171m 135b 6x4 0x6) SR: 49.62;

66.2;4;Harris to du Plessis, FOUR runs full, shaping into the pads, and he clips it superbly past the diving short midwicket. In the air for a moment, but it was never going to get caught;

65.6;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run dug in short, outside off, sways away from it;

64.3;?;Lyon to du Plessis, no run defends this one back to him;
64.2;4;Lyon to du Plessis, FOUR runs this is an even better shot. This is tossed up on middle and leg, he shimmies down again, meets it on the half0volley, and flicks this between mid-on and midwicket. That's a crowded area on the field, mind you;
64.1;4;Lyon to du Plessis, FOUR runs lovely way to get the fifty. Faf is the man you call when Tests need saving. Shimmies down the wicket, takes this on the full, and drives it wide of mid-on. Drags it from outside off;
63.6;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run defends a length ball off the front foot;
63.5;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run fuller, closer, quicker, but defended really solidly;

59.2;1;Pattinson to Philander, 1 run short of a length, angling in, worked around the corner for one;
59.1;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run and what a beaut Pattinson begins with. Almost a right-hand replay of Elgar dismissal. Jags back in from outside off, beats the inside edge, and Haddin has to put in a dive to his left to save four byes;

51.4;1;Lyon to du Plessis, 1 run looks to paddle this, but ends up cueing it. Nearly taken by Doolan at short leg. This is a soft edge, but some times they don't stick at short leg;
51.3;?;Lyon to du Plessis, no run;
51.2;?;Lyon to du Plessis, no run Haddin has missed a stumping. You don't miss the Faf. He can make you pay. Jumps out of the crease, is beaten by the non-turner, and Haddin fails to collect it;

50.6;?;Smith to Philander, no run this one doesn't turn, pitches on a length, in front of leg. Beats the inside edge;

42.6;?;Pattinson to du Plessis, no run oh hello. This one jumps away from just short of a length. Extra bounce, away movement. Except that it starts too wide to make him play;

37.6;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run ouch. Into the rib at 151.4ks. That is going to leave an ugly bruise. This shortie doesn't rise even as Duminy ducks. You could almost hear a thud in the stands as it hit him;

35.4;W;Johnson to de Villiers, OUT definitely too early then, Mel Bourne. AB makes a mistake. Happens when it is reversing at such high pace. AB plays away from the body as Johnson pitches this full and outside off. Just the hands go as the feet are stuck. The edge is taken. Clarke snares it at second slip;AB de Villiers c Clarke b Johnson 14 (69m 37b 2x4 0x6) SR: 37.83;
35.3;1;Johnson to du Plessis, 1 run on a length, pitched outside leg, clipped away to long leg;

33.5;?;Johnson to du Plessis, no run defended off the front foot;
33.4;?;Johnson to du Plessis, no run verbals fly as Faf wants to pick this up. Short, stays slow, hits the pad, the ball has rolled next to the stumps. Faf is picking it up, and there are three Aussies in his ear. Not his job to return the ball. And they are maintaining the ball for reverse. They don't want foreign hands on it. No appeal for handling the ball, though;
33.3;?;Johnson to du Plessis, no run swing away again, defended just outside off;
33.2;?;Johnson to du Plessis, no run slight shape away from middle and off, defended to cover;

32.6;?;Harris to du Plessis, no run another half a shout as this one squeezes back in and beats the inside edge. The eight saves him. Not sure I can be saying that because the height also means it has caught him flush on the box. That is going to hurt;
32.5;?;Harris to du Plessis, no run short of a length, on off, defended;
32.4;?;Harris to du Plessis, no run the inswinging full bunger. Appeals for lbw but they won't listen to Harris after that horrible review earlier in the day. This one hoops back in, but Faf has got the toe of the bat on it;

32.2;?;Harris to du Plessis, no run this one swings in, defended to him;
32.1;?;Harris to du Plessis, no run Harris begins with an edge. This one holds its line outside off, Faf plays for the swing, but the edge doesn't carry to the second slip;

Silly mid-on comes in
 Innings Start
2.28pm Declaration now. Graeme Smith has called for a heavy roller. The last time he will do on a Test field. Unless he is unbeaten at stumps tonight. In 10 minutes he will walk out for his final Test innings. Unfortunately, to a poor attendance at Newlands. The target is 511 in a possible 142 overs. Of course 142 won't be bowled. The over rate has been poor. They have half an hour and four sessions to survive. Three of those sessions are expected to be 150-minute long
Bob: ""Smith is doing what his team needs. A little girl is hit by the ball, just behind the fence". Glad you didn't put those two sentences around the other way"

56.4;1;Abbott to Haddin, 1 run short of a length, outside off, finally they were getting a dot, but there has been an overthrow from point;
56.3;W;Abbott to Warner, OUT Abbott gets another. His grind has at least got him wickets. Warner looks to smash this over midwicket, gets a healthy edge, ABD takes it.

Surely the security guard could have either moved away or planted his chair closer to the boundary boards and not the rope? I think Duminy even apologised. Ha;
52.2;W;Abbott to Clarke, OUT golden duck for Clarke. Does he now wish he had declared earlier? Looks to drive a length ball over mid-off, gets only the outside half of the bat, is caught at mid-off;Michael Clarke c sub (Q de Kock) b Abbott 0 (7m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

51.1;?;Morkel to Warner, no run wide fullie, beats his bat;
50.6;W;Abbott to Watson, OUT lovely catch by Duminy at point, and I see Clarke wear a helmet. No declaration yet. Wide ball, Watson goes after it, thinks he has hit it over point, but Duminy times his leap to perfection, and takes the catch. Good on Watto. Two selfless innings that will hit his average, but he has tried to do what the team has needed;Shane Watson c Duminy b Abbott 25 (31m 17b 1x4 2x6) SR: 147.05;

48.5;?;Elgar to Warner, no run short of a length, outside off, dabbed away;
48.4;6;Elgar to Warner, SIX runs he has hit a six without getting anywhere close to the pitch of the ball. Elgar has done well to push this wide having seen Warner jump out, but Warner still manages to get a half-decent hit. Decent enough to send it over long-on;

48.2;1;Elgar to Warner, 1 run driven to deep cover this time;

46.5;?;Morkel to Warner, no run wide length ball, slashes at it. Beaten;
46.4;2;Morkel to Warner, 2 runs there it is. Two hundreds in the same Test. The first man since Kallis to do so in South Africa. Punches this past point for a couple, raises his helmet on the way back for the second. A standing ovation is accompanied by applause from G Smith too;
46.3;?;Morkel to Warner, no run short of a length, on middle and off, defended to cover;
46.2;?;Morkel to Warner, no run beauty from Morkel. Short of a length, middle and leg, seams away. Misses the edge. Nearly gone on 99. Twice;
46.1;1;Morkel to Watson, 1 run Warner nearly run out on 99. Oh Watto. Why odes it happen with him around? Hit to midwicket, du Plessis is sensational with the dive, Warner goes through for one, is hit on his sliding back with the throw. Never changed direction. No appeal for obstructing the field;

44.6;W;Morkel to Doolan, OUT Doolan finally ends his painstaking stay. Morkel bowls a bouncer, Doolan pulls, gets a top edge, and it flies to long leg. The bigger news is, Shane Watson has been promoted;Alex Doolan c Abbott b Morkel 37 (91m 87b 5x4 0x6) SR: 42.52;

38.5;?;Abbott to Warner, no run short of a length, outside leg, angles towards off, stays low, hits his pad, rolls to AB, and Warner is nearly run out because he sets off without knowing where the ball is. He would have made it even if this had hit direct;
38.4;1;Abbott to Doolan, 1 run short of a length, on off, worked away to long leg;
38.3;?;Abbott to Doolan, no run looks to play that stylish pull of his, but this ball isn't short enough, and he has edged this onto his pad;

20.2;W;Morkel to Rogers, 1 run, OUT digs this short, Rogers looks to pull, gloves it to fine leg. Steyn might just have given South Africa a wicket with that throw. Actually this is AB's wicket too. Rogers is taking it easy because AB has to move away from the stumps, towards the throw, to collect it. AB, though, with his back to the stumps, has judged this is going to be a direct hit, and lets it go. Rogers caught ambling;Chris Rogers run out (Steyn) 39 (92m 67b 6x4 0x6) SR: 58.2;

18.6;1;Steyn to Warner, 1 run pushes this to cover with soft hands, and comes through for a single;
18.5;4lb;Steyn to Warner, 4 leg byes four more but leg-byes this time. This is pitched outside leg again, and Warner misses this one. The pads do the job, though;
18.4;4;Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs that will be four more. This is short of a length, outside leg, and he goes airborne and glances this fine for four. Off the inside edge actually;

18.2;6;Steyn to Warner, SIX runs Warner is rubbing their noses in it. On a length, outside off, and he goes down a knee, and lofts him back over his head. Shades of Gilchrist in this innings;

16.4;?;Steyn to Warner, no run on a length, angling in, defended to midwicket;

11.1;1;Duminy to Warner, 1 run bowls full, on off, pushed to deep cover for one;
10.6;4;Philander to Rogers, FOUR runs uppishly played. Nothing going to hand here. Rogers wants to punch this from just outside off, gets a thick outside edge, and it flies between the second slip and gully. They seriously need to consider a third man here;
10.5;?;Philander to Rogers, no run on a length, seams away from middle and leg, defended towards cover;
10.4;1;Philander to Warner, 1 run punched away towards deep midwicket this time. Gets a single;
10.3;2;Philander to Warner, 2 runs plays the short-arm pull, to the right of long leg, scampers back for the second;

8.6;?;Philander to Rogers, no run short of a length, middle and off, left alone;
8.6;1nb;Philander to Rogers, (no ball) fuller, just outside off, defended off the front foot. It has been called a no-ball, but this is so clearly not a no-ball. There was some part of the foot behind the line as he landed. Another poor no-ball call to go with many no-balls missed during this Test;
8.5;?;Philander to Rogers, no run appeal for lbw as this one seams back in from around leg. Turned down. SA review it. This has straightened after pitching, hit him on the back leg, but it has pitched outside leg. Only about 30% of the ball pitches within the stumps. The on-field decision stays;

8.3;?;Philander to Warner, no run short of a length, middle and leg, defended;
8.2;4;Philander to Warner, FOUR runs edge produced but there is only one slip there, and no third man to keep these runs down. Smith is having a tough time captaining the side in his last Test.

6.3;1;Philander to Warner, 1 run full, on the pads, pushed wide of mid-on. Steyn is the man who fields this. He will soon try to bowl. They will need the best of Steyn to delay Australia's declaration;

4.1;4;Morkel to Warner, FOUR runs half-volley, jut outside off, driven handsomely through cover for four;

Four minutes to go. If there is no more after this over, we will have lost eight overs today
 Innings Start
"So, to win that game, a man with a busted knee comes in to bowl his 25th over, and hits the off stump twice in 3 balls with 140kph yorkers. You really can't argue with that." No, James, you can't. It is great to see Australia back where we have all been used to seeing them. Bloody-minded, tough cricketers who leave it all out on the field. A lot of skill involved too. This pitch didn't have anything for the bowlers on the last day, and they manufactured six wickets with six terrific deliveries. This was just great Test-match cricket. And South Africa have finally been conquered. For the first time in five years. It needed a man on knees that need surgery to bowl two sensational deliveries in the end. That's how difficult it has been to beat South Africa. And we all knew there was only one team that could do it. It had gone missing for a while. We were just waiting for that team to come back and do it. Welcome back, Australia. Thank you, Graeme Smith. Nobody questions the absence of the cover-drive now. Test cricket, you beauty
Time for presentation now
"The courage the guys showed was immense," says Graeme Smith, who is cheered off generously. "We have been outplayed in this Test throughout so it was important to show the fight today. I am really proud of that, but it is important to congratulate Michael Clarke and his team. We have had great battles over the past years, and this one will go down too. Obviously it has been pretty emotional few days. Pretty much on my mind at the start of the series, but for some reason kept putting it off. With my daughter in and out of the hospital? Ever since I moved here as an 18-year-old, Newlands has been my home so this was the perfect place to do it. Since the time I started everybody commented on my style of batting saying I won't make it so to end with these runs is a proud achievement. From a leadership perspective, having been part of so many wonderful results is amazing. When you get the job at 22, a lot of growth needs to happen. It took me a few years to figure out what was needed. This is the first series we have lost in almost eight years. We can be hugely proud of it. We have found ways to win. At home, away from home. Lastly I want to thank the fan. To all the people who have approached me on the streets, to all that have bought tickets, to all that have stayed up late to support us, I am really thankful."
"A massive achievement," says David Warner, the Man of the Match and the Series. "Bit nervous towards the end. Still remembered Adelaide. Phenomenal. Probably got my head screwed on for once. The time that di Venuto has put in has been great. Not everyday you get two guys bowling at 150ks at you. Always a challenge. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Massive. Proud of the guys."
"What a series," says Michael Clarke. "Frstly, I want to think Graeme Smith and his team. The world will be a sad place for him retiring. It has been tough away from home for us for a long time. The way the boys have played is tremendous. The series in India and England were not good. To turn it around is great. All the support staff has been great too. I don't like Morne one nit. Him and Dale keep aiming for my head, and they don't miss too often. Playing South Africa, and in South Africa, has been the greatest challenge. Great to have won here. Mitch and Ryan Harris have been exceptional. Patto comes in and takes wicket. Nathan Lyon. Watto. We will enjoy the series now. I didn't enjoy today a lot. A long day. It was getting really close. There is still a lot of work to do to get where South Africa is."
6pm What a great finish this has been. I love how Ryan Harris put it. He was out there in the middle. These words should stay with everyone who underestimates a Test win. "That out there was proper Test-match cricket. That was bloody hard." Just how Test cricket should have been. Australia didn;t want to come back with regrets. They left everything on that pitch
Alan Gaskon: "I'm as gutted as can be, but it's so nice to see the players respect and forgive one another. Especially steyn/clarke! "
5.50pm "That's unbelievable," says Ryan Harris. "Philander batted very very well, but we bowled really really well. I knew the ball was reversing. Got one through Dale, which had been very very difficult. The first two Tests were disappointing for me personally, I should have been bowling like this. My body is done. Mine is ready for a cleanout. That out there was proper Test-match cricket. That was bloody hard."
"We didn't have thoughts of the draw in our head," says Mitchell Johnson. "It was terrific how Rayno bowled today. All of us did our part out there. They did a great job batting. They were in for the long haul. Not much time left. So great. They stuck it out. We stuck it out."
It's 10 to six. What an end to the match. Don't go by the margin in runs. Australia have won this by 27 balls. They have had to grind for every wicket today. South Africa didn't gift them a single stick today. It was good-old fashioned struggle for a win. South Africa did their best to give their captain a farewell gift, but Australia were just too good. There were some really heated-up scenes in the last session, but now both the sides are congratulating each other. Forget childish sledges and howling dogs, there is also great respect for each other in these two sides. Clarke has the longest chat with Graeme Smith and with Dale Steyn
134.3;W;Harris to Morkel, OUT Bad knees. No matter. Harris does it one last time. Australia celebrate. This is sensational bowling. Now he can get the surgery in peace. What an absolute beaut Harris is. Bowls this full and fast, beats the inside edge with the angle, and bursts through the gate. The off stumps is rattled. So is Morkel. So is Philander. What a great last ball. That reverse through the gate late. Hit the middle of off;Morne Morkel b Harris 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
134.2;?;Harris to Morkel, no run pushes this down leg. One down. 28 to go;
134.1;W;Harris to Steyn, OUT Oh Ryan Harris you beauty. With knees that need surgery. He produces a yorker. The Aussie spirit lives on. Another injured man walks off. Steyn has played 44 balls. Harris gets an outswing yorker, this is just outside off, Steyn looks to dig it out, gets an inside edge. Off bail of off. That terrible sound for Steyn. How terrific for Harris. The bail almost didn't come off. Not for the first time has a bowling change produced a wicket first ball;Dale Steyn b Harris 1 (75m 44b 0x4 0x6) SR: 2.27;
133.6;?;Johnson to Philander, no run wide on the crease, gets it to hold its line against the angle, but it is not close enough to make him play;
133.5;?;Johnson to Philander, no run wide length ball, holds its line, left alone again. Another huge cheer;
133.4;?;Johnson to Philander, no run huge huge lbw shout as Johnson slings one past the inside edge. This is surely going down leg, but Clarke has reviewed this. The angle is too big for it to hit the pad within the line and then go on to hit the stumps too. Missing leg by a mile. A review wasted. Precious seconds that could get them an extra over too?;
133.3;?;Johnson to Philander, no run a bouncer that stays low, angling in, and he ducks under it. Gets really really down. Moves to square leg. Adjusts his helmet. Comes back to face;
133.2;?;Johnson to Philander, no run short of a length, outside off, another cheer in the crowd as he keeps this out;
133.1;?;Johnson to Philander, no run bouncer, a ripping bouncer. Just outside off. Philander jumps with it, and then sways out of its line. Great bowling, great batting. What a 100th ball;
132.6;?;Watson to Steyn, no run swinging in towards the pad. That is the lbw/catch at short midwicket ball. Steyn has kept this one out too;
132.5;?;Watson to Steyn, no run that's a wide length ball, and has been let enough. Haddin fails to collect it. Doesn't matter. It is another dot;
132.4;?;Watson to Steyn, no run wide length ball, Steyn steps forward and leaves again;
132.3;?;Watson to Steyn, no run solid front-foot defensive from Steyn. Another cheer. Under 40 balls now;
132.2;?;Watson to Steyn, no run left alone;
132.1;?;Watson to Steyn, no run bouncer, from just outside off, Steyn ducks under it;
131.6;?;Johnson to Philander, no run full and wide. Philander doesn't need to play at it. Another cheer from the crowd. These two have survived 77 balls. They need to play out 42 more;
131.5;?;Johnson to Philander, no run full, angling in, defended back to him;
131.4;?;Johnson to Philander, no run short of a length, well outside off, another leave. Another cheer from the crowd;
131.3;?;Johnson to Philander, no run angling in too far, clips the pad. Haddin can't collect it, but Philander turns down the leg-bye;
131.2;4;Johnson to Philander, FOUR runs angling in, too straight, Phiander gets a touch on it. Gets four runs. Crosses the cursed 40s. Raises the bat for the fifty, but he is not too pleased yet. He knows it won't count for much if South Africa lose two more wickets;
131.1;?;Johnson to Philander, no run short of a length, outside off, Philander lets it be;
130.6;?;Watson to Steyn, no run another solid front-foot defensive to end the over. Down to 48 balls now. Or 31 minutes. Whichever arrives later;
130.5;?;Watson to Steyn, no run full, swinging in. Defended back. Watson does the mock throw-back at Steyn. Is booed by the small crowd in. Steyn smiles;
130.4;?;Watson to Steyn, no run fuller, on a length, on off, hits the thick outside edge. Falls short of gully;
130.3;?;Watson to Steyn, no run dug in short this time. Steyn drops his wrists. Sways out of its line. Another defence;
130.2;?;Watson to Steyn, no run short of a length, just outside off, defended from the crease;
130.1;?;Watson to Steyn, no run gets the edge first ball. The lower pace makes tailenders feel they can play at these. He gets a soft outside and lower edge. Doesn't carry obviously;
129.6;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run another big effort from Pattinson. Rising towards his chest at 139ks. Philander is on his toes. Keeps his down. That bottom hand is coming off the bat every time. As if taunting Australia;
129.5;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run another grunt as he angles this into the pads. He defends with the bottom hand off. Turns down another single;
129.4;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run another grunt as Pattinson is giving it his all. Short of a length. Angling in. Defended to leg;
129.3;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run on a length, angling towards off, defended off the front foot;
129.2;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run down the leg side, too short, he smells his armpits as he leaves it;
129.1;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run lets out a huge grunt as he lets this go, and he ducks under it;
128.6;?;Lyon to Steyn, no run another over played out. Down to the last 10. Or forty minutes;
128.5;?;Lyon to Steyn, no run fullie, dips, to Lyon's credit. Kept out;
128.4;?;Lyon to Steyn, no run another defensive off the back foot;
128.3;?;Lyon to Steyn, no run stays back to defend a length ball. The ball topspins back after hitting the ground, but Steyn is alert to keep it away;
128.2;?;Lyon to Steyn, no run tossed up wide, driven to mid-off where Johnson misfields. They don't even run;
128.1;?;Lyon to Steyn, no run short of a length, wide, Steyn leaves it be;
127.6;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run full, outside off, defended to cover;
127.5;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run wide on the crease, angling in, he has worked it past short leg. He refuses the single even though this is the fifth ball of the over;
127.4;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run rising towards the chest, Philander fends with the bottom hand off. Keeps it down again;
127.3;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run this is misdirected, thigh, and it's only Haddin who is made to work here. Goes down leg and collects;
127.2;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run full, but wide, and another leave;
127.1;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run wide on the crease, gets extra bounce from short of a length. Hits the handle of the bat. The bottom hand is not on it again. The ball stays down;
126.6;?;Harris to Steyn, no run and he still has enough spirit to bowl a bouncer. Steyn, with then injured hamstring, shows spirit of his own. Gets under it;
126.5;?;Harris to Steyn, no run wide length ball from wide on the crease. Fails to draw Steyn into playing the angle;
126.4;?;Harris to Steyn, no run wide length ball, left alone by Steyn;
126.3;?;Harris to Steyn, no run full, on off, defended solidly;
126.2;?;Harris to Steyn, no run on a length, outside off, he pushes at it, gets a low outside edge, and it falls short of the cordon;
126.1;?;Harris to Steyn, no run length ball outside off, left alone;
125.6;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run short of a length, jagging back in, he is behind it and on top of it in defence;
125.5;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run dug in short, outside off, and is left alone well;
125.4;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run short of a length, into the body, plays with the bottom hand off, gets a single to leg;
125.3;2;Pattinson to Philander, 2 runs short of a length, angling in, he pushes at it, the ball runs off the thick inside edge;
125.2;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run full again, but a touch too wide. Philander leaves it alone. The crowd is small, but they are cheering every dot;
125.1;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run full, swinging in, this ball is going. Philander defends it well;
124.6;?;Harris to Steyn, no run short of a length, angling in, defended to leg without drama;
124.5;?;Harris to Steyn, no run short, down the leg side, ducks under it;
124.4;?;Harris to Steyn, no run on a length, angling in, defended to leg;
124.3;?;Harris to Steyn, no run short of a length, on off, defended;
124.2;?;Harris to Steyn, no run short, down leg, easily negotiated;
124.1;?;Harris to Steyn, no run defends one on a length. Right behind it;
123.6;?;Johnson to Philander, no run and a ripper from Johnson produces a wicket. Or does it? He has reviewed this. This is a ripsnorter. Dug in short, rising towards the helmet. It has hit him on the shoulder. Johnson appeals. It is given. The umpire thinks it has hit the glove on the way. I think it has kissed the thumb on the way, but the glove is off the handle. This is a sensational review from Philander. I don't think he can be given. He is not holding the bat when his thumb is hit. Many replays have been shown. Mind you, there is no Hot Spot on the glove. What a review. Minutes have passed. Even Aleem Dar is nervous. He is about to cross his hands, which means the original decision stays. But then he crosses his arms, and rules it not out. This is not out. What a moment. Well done, Big Vern for such awareness of the law and the circumstance;
123.5;?;Johnson to Philander, no run into the pads with that angle, worked away to long leg, and he decides to protect Steyn;
123.4;?;Johnson to Philander, no run hits the pad with a length ball but he has bowled from wide on the crease so there is no lbw shout;
123.3;?;Johnson to Philander, no run short of a length again, holds its line, but Philander is not pushing at these;
123.2;?;Johnson to Philander, no run short of a length, angling in, defended from the crease;
123.1;?;Johnson to Philander, no run angling in, outside off, left alone;
122.6;?;Harris to Steyn, no run full, middle and off, defended;
122.5;?;Harris to Steyn, no run into the ribs. Steyn takes this on the body. A lot of applause and lip from the close-in fielders. Steyn smiles. What a fight;
122.4;?;Harris to Steyn, no run bouncer, and a good one. At 135ks. Steyn doesn't duck it . He gets it line to fend, and then sways out of the line as this is too high to fend. Perfect delivery. Steyn wouldn't bowling that if the boot had been on the other foot;
122.3;?;Harris to Steyn, no run full, into the pads, clipped away, can't beat the diving short midwicket;
122.2;?;Harris to Steyn, no run short of a length, outside off, left alone;
122.1;?;Harris to Steyn, no run on a length, outside off, defended to cover;
121.6;4b;Johnson to Philander, 4 byes that goes through everybody. Short of a length, and Philander looks to defend. It jags in to beat the inside edge, and flies over the stumps. Beats the diving Haddin too;
121.5;?;Johnson to Philander, no run the angle makes him play. They need this luck if they are to survive. He pushes at one outside off, which holds its line, and beats him. He is pushing away from the body;
121.4;?;Johnson to Philander, no run bouncer, he stays under it. Johnson gives him a stare and a word;
121.3;?;Johnson to Philander, no run wide on the crease, angling across, defended with an open face;
121.2;?;Johnson to Philander, no run full and straight, on off, kept out by him;
121.1;4;Johnson to Philander, FOUR runs pulled away again, off chest high, and Philander keeps pulling. He trusts his attack more than his defence, and is going ahead with it. Fair enough too;
120.6;?;Smith to Steyn, no run another front-foot defensive to end the maiden;
120.5;?;Smith to Steyn, no run full toss, pushed back to Smith;
120.4;?;Smith to Steyn, no run flighted on the pads, doesn't turn as much as he expects it to. The inside edge dies, and goes past short leg. They don't take the single;
120.3;?;Smith to Steyn, no run tossed up on off again, this time Steyn defends;
120.2;?;Smith to Steyn, no run flighted around off, he knows it is a legbreak, and lets it go;
120.1;?;Smith to Steyn, no run short, a long hop, he pulls this into the ground, and can't beat midwicket;
119.6;?;Johnson to Philander, no run full outside off, defended to mid-off;
119.5;4;Johnson to Philander, FOUR runs stylishly pulled away away from wide outside off. That's worth only one ball, though;
119.4;?;Johnson to Philander, no run full, middle and leg, kept out;
119.3;?;Johnson to Philander, no run short of a length, just outside off, cuts away to beat him;
119.2;1;Johnson to Steyn, 1 run on a length, on off, Steyn is squared up, gets a single past the cordon as this runs past the cordon;
119.1;W;Johnson to Duminy, OUT soft dismissal. How gutted will Duminy be. This is a length ball, on the pads, and he plays a shot that comes naturally to him, the clip behind square, and he has found leg slip. That man Johnson again. Australia pull back South Africa again. Just when their hopes begin to turn to expectations. Well played, Duminy, though. Lasted 99 balls;Jean-Paul Duminy c Lyon b Johnson 43 (159m 99b 8x4 0x6) SR: 43.43;
118.6;?;Lyon to Philander, no run short of a length, outside off, another over ticked off. Under 20 overs now;
118.5;?;Lyon to Philander, no run tossed up outside off, smothered to mid-off;
118.4;?;Lyon to Philander, no run this one stays low, but he is back again, and keeps it out;
118.3;?;Lyon to Philander, no run puts some effort into this ball, it turns and jumps, but from quite a short length. Philander is allowed to stays back and defend;
118.2;?;Lyon to Philander, no run allowed to stay back and defend again;
118.1;?;Lyon to Philander, no run stays back to defend a length ball;
117.6;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run full, on off, stays in the crease, blocks it back to him. More applause from the crowd;
117.5;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run full, swinging in, defended to leg. Duminy defends;
117.4;1;Johnson to Philander, 1 run on a length, on off, cuts away, he pushes with an open face, gets a single past cover;
117.3;?;Johnson to Philander, no run full outside off, left alone. Haddin collects it and runs to Johnson to have a word about something;
117.2;?;Johnson to Philander, no run short again, and down leg. Another one ticked off. He has a lot to say to Philander;
117.1;4;Johnson to Philander, FOUR runs dismissed from his presence by Philander. This is only waist high, and he has pulled this mercilessly through midwicket;
116.6;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run straighter this time, but he defends solidly;
116.5;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run short of a length, pitches outside off, he goes back and defends;

115.5;?;Johnson to Philander, no run full, quick, beats the bat, hits the pad, but is pitched outside leg;
115.4;?;Johnson to Philander, no run rapid short ball, he gets inside the line of it. Also fends away with his arms. Doesn't get a touch;

114.1;?;Clarke to Duminy, no run full, outside off, defended;
113.6;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run short of a length, outside off, pushed to cover. There has been a bit of crowd in now. A loud cheer goes around the ground as Philander defends this;
113.6;1nb;Pattinson to Philander, (no ball) beamer. A nasty one. The bat flies out of Philander's hand. This is high and full. Philander keeps it out but seems line he has been hit on the right glove. He sways the body out of the way, but is hurt. The helmet goes off, the drinks come on. Hit on the fingers. Apology from Pattinson is immediate;
113.6;1nb;Pattinson to Philander, (no ball) this tails back in from wide on the crease. Defended from the crease. No-ball called. Philander won't appreciate it much. Another delivery to be negotiated. Especially when Pattinson has not overstepped. Unless the replay we have been shown is wrong;
113.5;4;Pattinson to Philander, FOUR runs crunched away. This is short of a length, wide outside off, and he punches it through cover. Four runs don't matter. The one ball negotiated does;
113.4;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run short of a length, holds its line outside off, he defends it well;
113.3;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run pushes one wide outside off, but Philander refuses to get suckered into it;
113.2;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run wide on the crease again, on a length, Philander defends in front of the body, is hit on the high part of the bat. The bottom hand comes off. Beats short leg somehow. Pattinson is kept interested;

112.6;4;Smith to Duminy, FOUR runs another long hop pulled away for four. Duminy has played all six balls this over off the back foot;

112.4;4;Smith to Duminy, FOUR runs wide full toss, pushed with an open face, trickles to the point boundary for four. Partnership reaches 50, but what is important is that they have negotiated 63 legal deliveries;

112.2;4;Smith to Duminy, FOUR runs drops this short, and Duminy goes back to pull this through midwicket;

111.6;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run dug in short, it stays low, but Philander manages to get under this one;
111.5;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run more swing, but into the pads, defended to leg;
111.4;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run Pattinson has hands on head. This could be reverse swing. Another twist to the tale. Goes wide on the crease, gets some dip on this, swings it past the inside edge of the drive. Misses the stumps;
111.3;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run on a length, angling in, defended to mid-on;
111.2;?;Pattinson to Philander, no run hit in the rib but it draws an lbw appeal. It is that kind of a day. This dug in short, Philander wants to duck it, but the ball stays low and hits him in the rib. Would have bounced over, but not by much. Philander rubs his rib - Kiwis would say he rubs his rub;
111.1;1;Pattinson to Duminy, 1 run short of a length, on the pads, another single taken;
110.6;?;Harris to Philander, no run slower ball, on a length, just outside off, Philander defends solidly;
110.5;1;Harris to Duminy, 1 run worked away off the pads. The strike is turned over again;
110.4;1;Harris to Philander, 1 run short of a length, outside off, punched wide of cover. Philander is middling them all;
110.3;?;Harris to Philander, no run swinging in this time, beats the inside edge, but it is swinging too far and will have missed leg;

109.2;1;Pattinson to Duminy, 1 run full, on the pads, clipped away to midwicket;

108.6;?;Harris to Philander, no run slightly short of a length, solidly punched to cover;
108.5;2;Harris to Philander, 2 runs half-volley outside off, driven past mid-off. Makes Johnson run. That should also help at some time;
108.4;2;Harris to Philander, 2 runs tailing in, but ends up too straight, and is clipped past the ring of catching men on the leg side;
108.3;1;Harris to Duminy, 1 run on a length, seams away, takes the outside half of the bat, goes past gully;
108.2;?;Harris to Duminy, no run full, on off, defended to mid-off;

106.2;?;Harris to Philander, no run short of a length, Philander is forward in defence. Is hit on the high part of the bat;
106.1;?;Harris to Philander, no run what a leave outside off. This stays low and jags back. Would have hit had there been another set of stumps;
105.6;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run short of a length, angling in, he defends it to reach 64 balls faced and take South Africa to tea;
105.5;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run swinging in again, Duminy gets a thick inside edge to it. Johnson appeals, but that is mostly in excitement and optimism;
105.4;4b;Johnson to Duminy, 4 byes he has moved across the line, a touch too far, it excites everybody as the ball swings into the pads. It goes too far down leg, though, and goes for four byes;
105.3;3;Johnson to Philander, 3 runs short of a length, outside off, punched through the vacant mid-off region, and he gets three to get off the strike. Had I been Rogers, though, I wouldn't have chased this and would have given Philander so he stays at Johnson's end;
105.2;?;Johnson to Philander, no run fuller delivery, Philander gets the bat down in time. This hits the outside half of the bat;
105.1;6;Johnson to Philander, SIX runs Philander hits a six. Oh hello. Don't ruffle me up. But it is a top edge. And it flies over the keeper's head. Australia will like the look of this;
104.6;?;Smith to Duminy, no run flighted into the rough outside off, he stretches forward to kick it way;
104.5;1;Smith to Philander, 1 run nicely bowled. this dips on him, middle and leg, he stays back to work this around the corner for one;

103.3;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run left alone outside off as this is pitched up;
103.2;4;Johnson to Duminy, FOUR runs into the ribs this time, Duminy swats it down, and beats leg gully. Clarke applauds too. He wants him playing the shots. More chances of wickets that way;
103.1;4;Johnson to Duminy, FOUR runs short, chest-high, Duminy keeps the pull down. I guess it is better to play the shot if you are struggling to get out of its line;
102.6;4;Smith to Philander, FOUR runs short and wide, he goes back and cuts it away for four. Runs don't matter;
102.5;2;Smith to Philander, 2 runs short of a length, outside off, punched away past cover;

102.2;?;Smith to Philander, no run flighted on middle and leg, defended well;
102.1;W;Smith to du Plessis, OUT Smith gets it first ball. The likeliest of spinners to get a wicket. Faf has reviewed it. Lovely legspin bowling. This is drifting and dipping. For a change Faf has pushed down the wrong line. This one pitches on leg, doesn't turn as much as Faf expects it to, and hits him dead in front. Huge huge wicket. Australia huge favourites. Faf has played a big hand too. Second time today that the first ball of a new spell has got a wicket;Faf du Plessis lbw b Smith 47 (157m 109b 5x4 0x6) SR: 43.11;
101.6;4;Johnson to Duminy, FOUR runs short of a length, into the hip, tucked away between short leg and leg gully. This is what Johnson wants him to do. When it begins to rise towards the chest, it becomes difficult to keep it down;
101.5;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run slips this one wide. The arm just slings more than he wants it to. Easy leave;
101.4;?;Johnson to Duminy, no run bouncer, a touch too short, and easy to duck under;

98.4;?;Lyon to Duminy, no run flighted outside off, defended off the front foot this time;

95.2;4;Pattinson to Duminy, FOUR runs another delivery stays low, Duminy watches it well, and plays the short-arm pull in front of midwicket for four. This kind of run-getting is not good for my blood pressure;

84.2;W;Harris to de Villiers, OUT Too good from Harris. That channel is superb, no matter how good you are. If you keep bowling on a length just outside off, you will make the batsmen play the angle. And when you get it to seam, you will take the edge at some time. He has taken it now. Finally AB's fifty streak ends. The first time in 13 Tests that he has not scored a fifty. But he has faced 228 balls. More valuable than 50 runs easily. And it has ended to some top bowling from a top bowler;AB de Villiers c ?Haddin b Harris 43 (326m 228b 6x4 0x6) SR: 18.85;
84.1;?;Harris to de Villiers, no run Beaten. Harris is too good with the new ball. In that channel. Just outside off. Gets this to seam away;

"How do the fielders know which side of the ball will be affected by bouncing it to the keeper? Very biased commentary - thought ESPN was better than that." paul, I will leave the second part outside off. Re the first, the idea of bouncing the ball into the pitch is to not rough up one side. The idea is to get some rough on it, doesn't matter which side. And once one side has been scuffed up more, you start working on the other. Reverse is not an exact science, but when the pitch is doing nothing and there is no swing in the air, every team tries it
