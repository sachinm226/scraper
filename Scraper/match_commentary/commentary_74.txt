2.09pm Innings Break Australia gets 7 for 334 on the back of a stunning 153 from the skipper Aaron Finch. Steve Smith played beautifully and Glenn Maxwell delivered a gem at the end.
Aaron Finch: "I feel like I'm playing well. When you get a few on drives away for boundaries early it sets you up. I thought they used the big side of the ground well. It was quite windy as well. It was hard to target one side of the ground because they bowled quite defensive at times. All in all, pretty happy. We didn't have a target. We knew at the death, they're quality executors. I thought Maxy did a great job at the end."
Karthikeyan Kad: "Aus didn't really get away except that one over from Pradeep... Brilliant death over from SL.. Lasith is as usual and special kudos to Udana... What a performance..."
Udana was sensational.
Dhaval Shah: "If SL chases this - this will reignite their campaign and SL will take lot of confidence and energy from this chase and can look a completely different side. Might add more spice to the number 4 battle for semi-final. England, India and Australia are locked "
As we wait for the chase, a good time to fill your ears with the latest edition of our Talking World Cup podcast, where our crew make a good fist of making sense of the rivalry, as complex as it is (also on Apple Podcasts here)

 Innings Start
Thanks for joining us. Great fun today. The first 15 overs of Sri Lanka's innings was as entertaining as any passage so far this World Cup. Pretty sure there's plenty more coming on Sunday. It's India v Pakistan. Hope you've planned out your day in front of the TV and of course with us here on ESPNcricinfo. Trust me, your second-screen experience will be as good, if not better. For now, head over to our homepage to catch up with all the build-up. Some terrific pieces from Osman Samiuddin is already in. And there's promise for much more. I'll be back again early in the day to bring you up to speed with everything India v Pakistan. For the moment, I'm going to head off quickly to catch some sleep. Goodnight folks, pleasure having your company. Cheers!
Aaron Finch is the Player of the Match for his 153. "I was hitting some nice drives early, which is a good sign for my batting. It was a nice wicket. I'm working on trying to ensure my head doesn't fall over. We thought we could get 350 plus, but Sri Lanka executed superbly under pressure at the end. We thought we were a touch short with the new ball, Kusal and Dimuth were superb. You want to bowl top-of-off and when they kept hitting there, we had to change plans. It was nice for Maxwell to have a long boundary to bowl with, hard to get 10 overs out of him on flat wickets, but with a bit of real estate out here and the breeze against him, it helped to get overs out of him."
Dimuth Karunaratne: "Finch and Smith batted well, but we came back strongly. Lost key moments in the chase. Started well, but the middle order couldn't capitalise. They had to handle pressure and keep the momentum going. Starc, Cummins are world class, we knew what they could do, had to keep a plan but we didn't. We lost couple of games to the rain, now need to win a couple of games. We came here to play well, we want to play it one game at a time."
Malcolm: "Sri Lanka had the right approach, but as soon as Maxwell was brought on the game was over as a contest. People always praise his batting but I think he has been even more instrumental with his bowling, tightening the screws and reinstating psychological advantage for the Aussies." -- This was just the sort of pitch where he could do his thing. As Monga said earlier, this was no pitch to play four pacers, really.
6.00pm Sri Lanka were cruising. 87 without loss in 10 overs. Australia slipped into their Plan B and brought Maxwell on to try and preserve their trumpcards for later. Sri Lanka fell into the trap of the asking rate once Australia got the first breakthrough. Sri Lanka really needed Mathews and Thisara to bail them out, but once they fell, the chase was as good as over.
Karunaratne's 97 was in the end Sri Lanka's only consolation. If you're a Sri Lankan fan, you probably feel crushed right now. You have every right to feel that way. There was a ray of hope that turned into spurts of excitement. And then it all came crashing down.

15.3;W;Starc to Perera, OUT the middle stump is flattened! full, straight and the wicket comes as Kusal misses an attempted mow to the leg side. Australia get a breakthrough they desperately needed. Finch's decision to bring back his trump card works.;Kusal Perera b Starc 52 (64m 36b 5x4 1x6) SR: 144.44;
15.2;1;Starc to Dimuth, 1 run imperious flick down to deep square. Balance and timing all in sync;

14.4;3;Maxwell to Dimuth, 3 runs whips this into the huge gap between mid-on and deep midwicket. Excellent fielding, excellent running. Shaun Marsh covered good ground and then was off balance and going over the ropes -airborne - as he flicked it back;

12.3;?;Maxwell to Dimuth, no run gets well forward and bunts it back to the bowler;
12.2;?;Maxwell to Dimuth, no run massive appeal for lbw, not given but Australia can't review. Deceived in flight as he looks to skip out, plays all around it and is beaten by the drift. Looked out to me.. Poor decision from Illingworth.;
12.1;1;Maxwell to Perera, 1 run width and he slaps this to deep point;
11.6;?;Kane Richardson to Dimuth, no run hops back and defends this short of length delivery.;
11.5;4;Kane Richardson to Dimuth, FOUR runs he's clubbed this pull over midwicket, Khawaja may have got an inch on that one but it's not enough. Dimuth has a half-century and his mates are on their feet, as are the fans. What a superb knock so far.;
11.4;?;Kane Richardson to Dimuth, no run gets besides the line as he punches this short of length delivery to cover;
11.3;?;Kane Richardson to Dimuth, no run sways out of the way of this short ball, excellent delivery;

10.2;?;Maxwell to Perera, no run squirts this back to the bowler off a thick inside edge.;

9.6;?;Kane Richardson to Dimuth, no run gets half-forward and bunts this into the off side;
9.5;1;Kane Richardson to Perera, 1 run slapped to the man at sweeper cover, Khawaja it is;
9.4;?;Kane Richardson to Perera, no run beaten, extra bounce that time. Looked to run it down. Richardson and Carey think there may be something here, right on the edge and Finch reviews with two seconds on the clock. Let's see if there is a spike there. Replays come back with a straight line, which means there is no spike and Kusal can continue batting. Not out and Australia lose a review.;
9.3;4;Kane Richardson to Perera, FOUR runs dismissed from his presence! Banged in short, Perera wallops this pull in front of square. Raced away to the fence. Tired delivery from Richardson, not going to help bowling such lengths in the mid-130s. Cracking stroke that has forced a new bat on its way. The Sri Lankan fans in the stands are loving it, absolutely loving it.;
9.2;2;Kane Richardson to Perera, 2 runs pulled across the line, not timed all that well but he'll come back for the second;
9.1;1;Kane Richardson to Dimuth, 1 run on middle and leg, worked behind square on the leg side;
8.6;4;Behrendorff to Perera, FOUR runs slipping down leg and he tickles this past short fine leg. Pacy, angling in and all he had to do was get some bat along the way.;
8.5;?;Behrendorff to Perera, no run right behind the line of this incoming length ball as he defends;
8.4;1;Behrendorff to Dimuth, 1 run superbly flicked down to deep square leg;
8.3;5;Behrendorff to Perera, 5 runs they chance a single of the type Sehwag did after tucking one to mid-on and taking on Lehmann's throw in that 2003 final. This time, there's an overthrow from Finch and they get five (four overthrows). It's all going Sri Lanka's way so far. Kusal threw himself in desperation to complete the run, but not sure even that dive would've saved him if it was a direct hit.;
8.2;2;Behrendorff to Perera, 2 runs clipped into the gap and they take two more;
8.1;6;Behrendorff to Perera, SIX runs shades of Jayasuriya! Width and he clobbers this length ball over the extra cover boundary. Stand and deliver;
7.6;1;Kane Richardson to Perera, 1 run hoicked across the line to deep square leg;
7.5;2;Kane Richardson to Perera, 2 runs hammered, absolutely hammered. Some effort that from Pat Cummins to run around from deep square to where a deep midwicket would be. Saved two runs for the side;
7.4;?;Kane Richardson to Perera, no run right behind the line as he blocks;
7.3;1;Kane Richardson to Dimuth, 1 run beaten as he looks to slap this away;
7.2;4;Kane Richardson to Dimuth, FOUR runs on the pads and he's clipped this wide of short fine leg. Easy, very easy. Nothing more than a warm-up delivery. Help-me-on-its-way welcome drink;
7.1;?;Kane Richardson to Dimuth, no run Richardson bowled, Dimuth defends, but one of them attempted this delivery in half-heated fashion. Replays confirm Dimuth wasn't entirely read. Dead ball. So he'll rebowl that? Okay, umpire says it's a legal ball as the batsman ended up facing it;
6.6;1;Behrendorff to Dimuth, 1 run hops back and tucks this into the gap at square leg;
6.5;4;Behrendorff to Dimuth, FOUR runs not for the first time tonight have we seen a thick inside edge flying past the stumps. Dollops of luck here for the skipper as he is late on the frontfoot drive, races to the fine leg boundary.;
6.4;4;Behrendorff to Dimuth, FOUR runs one-handed pull, beats short fine leg. Swivelled nicely and helped it along. Using the bowler's pace very nicely.;
6.3;1;Behrendorff to Perera, 1 run mistimes this pull into the gap at midwicket;
6.2;1;Behrendorff to Dimuth, 1 run squared up a hint as he bunts this into the covers;
6.1;2;Behrendorff to Dimuth, 2 runs back of length on middle and leg, tucked off his hips to deep square;
5.6;1;Cummins to Dimuth, 1 run steered wide of point, down to third man;
5.5;?;Cummins to Dimuth, no run takes a step across and drives this into the off side;
5.4;?;Cummins to Dimuth, no run gets a thick inside edge onto the pad as he looks to turn this to the leg side.;
5.3;4;Cummins to Dimuth, FOUR runs off a thick inside-edge, Cummins can't believe how that's not cannoned into the stumps! Feeble push at a delivery angling away, no feet. Lucky to survive.;
5.2;4;Cummins to Dimuth, FOUR runs no timing but gets enough on this pull as it races down the hill to the midwicket boundary. This was short, angling away and Dimuth picked the length early and went through with the pull. Lovely.;
5.1;?;Cummins to Dimuth, no run away-going length ball which he bunts to the off side;
4.6;1;Behrendorff to Dimuth, 1 run works this incoming length ball to midwicket where there's a misfield, and they get through for a single.;
4.5;?;Behrendorff to Dimuth, no run beaten as he pokes at this delivery with an angled bat face. The change of angle seems to be working already for Australia.;
4.4;?;Behrendorff to Dimuth, no run defends this full delivery back to the bowler;
4.3;?;Behrendorff to Dimuth, no run beaten for pace as this skids back in to hit him high on the pad. Stifled appeal, not out.;
4.2;?;Behrendorff to Dimuth, no run punches this length ball to mid-on;
4.1;?;Behrendorff to Dimuth, no run beaten as he gets this to nip away off the seam from the fourth-stump.;
3.6;3;Cummins to Dimuth, 3 runs gorgeous! How good does he look when he looks to play proper cricketing shots? Not a half-volley by any means but he plans half-forward and laces this into the gap between cover and point. Ball slows down towards the square boundary;
3.5;?;Cummins to Dimuth, no run beaten as he looks to slash this with a closed bat face. Lucky to not get an edge.;
3.4;?;Cummins to Dimuth, no run mistimes this straight drive back to the bowler. Once again late on the shot, toe-ended it.;
3.3;1;Cummins to Perera, 1 run looks to drive, gets a thick inside edge past midwicket;
3.2;?;Cummins to Perera, no run hits him low on the bat as he tries to drive, rolls to mid-off. The ball is thudding into the bat than it being the other way. Cummins working up serious pace.;
3.1;?;Cummins to Perera, no run punches this length delivery straight to point;
2.6;?;Starc to Dimuth, no run beaten for pace, looks to tuck it square but this brushes his thigh pad on the way through to the keeper.;
2.5;?;Starc to Dimuth, no run ducks under this ripper of a bouncer angling in from wide of the crease;
2.4;?;Starc to Dimuth, no run on the floor! Yorker honing into the leg at 150kph, Dimuth falls over as he tries to negotiate that.;
2.3;2;Starc to Dimuth, 2 runs squared up, gets a thick edge and Richardson comes around at third man to stop;
2.2;?;Starc to Dimuth, no run hops back into the crease and defends back this length delivery. Speedgun clocks that at 149kph;
2.1;?;Starc to Dimuth, no run driven back but Starc stops it with his boot on his followthrough. Was timed beautifully though;
1.6;4;Cummins to Perera, FOUR runs pulled! This is even better. Right off the middle. Into the gap between midwicket and square leg. Short square boundary that side and at the moment, there's just one winner in this battle. Magnificent approach to the chase. Can Sri Lanka sustain this?;
1.5;?;Cummins to Perera, no run much fuller and straighter, squirts this into the off side;
1.4;4;Cummins to Perera, FOUR runs he's blasted this pull in front of square, tracer bullet stuff! Picked the length early and flat-batted this disdainfully. This is an excellent start for Sri Lanka, stand-and-deliver stuff;
1.3;3;Cummins to Dimuth, 3 runs full on the pads and Dimuth nearly flicks this into the gap past the diving square leg fielder. The ball slows up near the boundary. Excellent wrist work;
1.2;?;Cummins to Dimuth, no run slants a short of length delivery across, left alone;
1.1;1;Cummins to Perera, 1 run helped along to fine leg. Did he get some bat on it? Yes, a very faint one onto the thigh pad. He was hurried for pace first up.;
0.6;4;Starc to Dimuth, FOUR runs stands tall and spanks this wide of point. Got on top of the bounce, used the width and let his timing do the rest. Superb from the skipper. Sri Lanka couldn't have asked for a better start. Gets their fans going, the flags are out;
0.5;2;Starc to Dimuth, 2 runs steered over the diving Maxwell at point, down to square third man. Richardson had to move to his left this time, comfortably back for the second run;
0.4;1lb;Starc to Perera, 1 leg bye rip roaring yorker, Kusal is thrown off balance as he squeezes this between his legs and past the keeper. Came off the pad. Finch and Australia don't review. Good call.;
0.3;4;Starc to Perera, FOUR runs uppish but into the gap! Scorching drive between cover and point.;
0.2;?;Starc to Perera, no run length ball veering in from wide of the crease, Kusal is hit high on the pad as he plays outside the line. Beat him on the inside edge. Good bowling;
0.1;1;Starc to Dimuth, 1 run edged and it races down to square third man where Kane Richardson mops it up;

2.40pm Thank you, Alex. Welcome back. We are minutes away from Sri Lanka's chase. If you need to know, "Karunaratne is a massive Starc bunny in Tests," Fidel informs me from Cardiff (He's away at Afghanistan v South Africa). He got him five out of the six times (all cheaply) in the 2016 Test series. Two out of three times in the series this year. Let's see how Sri Lanka's captain will respond against his nemesis. Kusal Perera walks out to open with him. This should be fun. It's pretty dark and the flood lights are taking effect at The Oval.
