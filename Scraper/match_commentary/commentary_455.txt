Our man Dan Brettig has dug up some interesting numbers: "Day one lunch scores in last two Aust v SL Tests in Kandy: Aust 61-7 in 1999, Aust 61-4 2004."
 Innings Start
3.30pm Play has been called off. Bad news folks, that's it for today.
Eusha: "There's no doubt Khwaja is unlucky! He's stuck on 13!" Shaun Marsh finished the day 13 short of a hundred yesterday.
Thanks all for tuning in and sending us the esoteric info about weather, archery and what not. Should be an early start tomorrow, we'll be back at 9.30am. See you then.
And last mail before logging out. Sid Boyce: "Cyprus for no rain, against that the pitches and the grounds. Other than for the cricket it's a great feeling to know that between the end of April and the end of September you don't have to think of an umbrella or raincoat. The rest of the year the rain gods turn the taps on. Still I love the place."
3.15pm Chances of play today getting bleaker.
Chandana: "Forget the cricket for a moment folks. England are trailing Argentina 3:9 in NZ. Yes the Rugby Union World Cup 2011 is in full swing :) cheers." And you can follow that on our sister site Scrum.
Geoff Marsh on watching Shaun making a hundred: "That's got to be the highlight of my life." Dan Brettig has that and more in his latest tour diary.
2.55pm Tom Moody says "Rain is getting more consistent here in Kandy looks very unlikely we will see the players out again today."
Around the world with Cricinfo continues. Here's Umesh from Cyprus: "It hasn't rained here in 6 months. why these teams don't come to visit Cyprus and play rest of the match. Cypriots are keen to play cricket due to the dry weather these days."
Getting further and further away from cricket.Robert Brown: "Have Raced horses in Darwin, the wet season really takes hold from November and yes they still race in the wet season, the track is oil based and the water runs off, and they still run quick times, very humid and the wet season in Darwin is called the silly season, drives people mad and sometimes people do very silly things, it has a high rate of suicide during the period. True."
2.45pm Geoff Marsh isn't in town just to watch his son bat. He is in talks to be Sri Lanka's coach. Read all about it here.
In praise of archers. Shax: "It's raining here in Thimphu, Bhutan at the moment, too. Hasn't stopped the archery matches, though. Hardier than cricketers, these Bhutanese!" And hardier than tennis players too.
When was the last time Darwin got this much attention from Cricinfo readers. Andrew Symonds' fishing trip? Brett Steinhert: "I have lived in Darwin for 10 years. Darwin's climate is tropical savannah because of the length of the dry season from may to september where on average 50mm occurs in this period. A tropical rainforest climate occurs where rainfall is greater than 60mm in every month (Kandy). Darwin receives 1800mm from Oct-Apr on average, so it is a tropical wet and dry climate."
2.35pm Update (of sorts): Still the same in Pallekele, full ground covers on as it continues to rain. Dan Brettig says: "Can't see much play on horizon." Tea has been taken
In case any of you are wondering what the weather is like in Austria, here's Gazza: "Thx Laks, as George said, Darwin is tropical, having lived and played cricket there for over 25 years, I'd definitly say Darwin is tropical. If they could packup right now and move to Vienna, the next 3 days are for sunny and warm with upto 30 degrees."
Tmx has some changes in mind: "Speaking of Sri Lankan batting order, I think Samaraweera should be dropped and that place should go to Thirimanne. Dilshan should move back to Angelo's place and Angelo should occupy Samaraweera's place."
2.25pm George kicks off a meteorological debate: "@Laks, Darwin is only 12 degrees south of the equator and is most definitely tropical, not subtropical. Technically it's a tropical savannah climate, whereas SL is a tropical rainforest climate. Ian Healy's daughter is pretty handy with the gloves, why not try her out?" If you are referring to Alyssa, she's his niece.
Luke: "If that's the forecast then Clarke's hand is forced. If Aus want to win then declare NOW!"
A viral video in the making. Rach: "If this ends up a draw because of weather, I'm going to eat my trousers. I don't think there are any socks left from the last test."
Sumith wants big changes (not in personnel though): "Harsh but Sri Lanka's biggest liability is dilshan at the top. His flashy careless game is a total downer for the team. They could do with him batting lower down the order. Plus he's a self-proclaimed all rounder so can be flexible. and mahela should open in all forms. A good start is essential in all forms 1. Mahela 2. parvit 3. sanga 4. Thilan 5. Angelo 6. Dilshan 7. PJ"
2.10pm Still raining in Pallekele.
And for those of you asking about the weather over the next two days. It's not good news. BBC had predicted "light rain shower" today, it's "heavy rain shower" tomorrow and, hold your breath, "thunder storm" on Monday.
Jordan: "I'm most concerned about Sri Lanka's pace stocks. Looking through the top 25 wicket takers in their first class competition last year, only three of them were pace bowlers." Much is expected of the pacy youngster Nuwan Pradeep, who was injured just before the England Tests earlier this year.
2.00pm Rahul: "remember that last ball run out all too well...if only Raju had concentrated on his running and not on his celebratory mid pitch dance.......alas....couldn't eat for days after that." And Kiran More getting bowled earlier in the over was the first time I saw a stump cam being shattered.
Ulu: "Can't we start talking about the Sri Lankan batting changes?" Ok, but can anyone from the top seven be dropped? Paranavitana had a reasonably good tour of England. Then the four seniors, Mathews and the keeper.
Robert Brown sticks to the Aus keepers topic, sort of: "well just watching classic 83 84 Rod Marsh just dropped David Gower was a sitter too."
Laks gives us a lesson on Sri Lanka weather: "@gazza it's not that simple. There are 2 rainy season in Sri Lanka, and one which affects the south west, and one which affects the north east. To further complicate matters, some areas (zones) can be drier than others in the same region. However, as Sri Lanka experiences a tropical climate, as opposed to the sub-tropical of Darwin, torrential rain may strike in any season or zone. "
1.50pm Smudgeon: "This who-should-replace-Haddin talk is getting a bit old. Maybe they should bring back Boonie? A better bat than the current contenders, plus he did a decent job with the gloves in the 92 World Cup!" Anyone remember that run-out of Venkatapathy Raju on the final ball, after Steve Waugh dropped a catch at the boundary?
And Michael Vaughan has just weighed in on the Australian wicketkeeper debate. "No question.. Paine" is his verdict.
Two Ryans on the call for changes in Aussie line-up. Ryan1: "We were humiliated during the Ashes for reasons/limitations which have yet to be definitively improved, hence our demands! :P"
Ryan2: "Australia may be on top here, but that is not the point. Australians are not satisfied with even being number 2 in the world, Until we're number 1, winning everything, with 11 players consistently performing at an exceptional level, we aren't happy. It just so happens that is also the attidude required to be the best in the world!"
And a mail on another Ryan. Sumith: "I'm sure Ryan Campbell wishes he was 25 now. Poor thing never got to play because Gilly was so fit and consistent. Getting a game as a keeper for Australia was a 100 times harder then than what it is now !"
1.45pm Shih-Lon is the voice of reason: "I don't see why there's so much discussion about chopping and changing a batting lineup in a team that seems to be doing reasonably well for the first time in a while. Erratic selections and giving no time to players to settle down was one of the reasons Australia were suffering, and i think they should just stick with what is working - at least for the near future. Though comments about Haddin seem pretty valid. He's had his time. "
Paul makes a robust case for Wade: "Hartley before Matt Wade? Wade averaged 47 with the bat last season including 96 in the Shield Final, when the Vics were really struggling. If you follow Allan Border's selection criteria, Shield final runs are looked at very favourably and Wade can play all 3 forms of the game. Wade before both Paine or Hartley."
And Nickolai asks: "What happened to Graham Manou?" Well, he retired, I'm reliably informed by Brydon Coverdale, who also provides this link.
A concise and plaintive plea from Bernie Bourke: "declare now please pup."
1.35pm The rain is getting heavier, more covers coming on.
Jules: "Khawaja looks class. Pity that with Haddin so terribly out of form, he keeps on having to bat with the tail. Both Clarke and Hussey have had bad runs of scores (if not form) batting at 4 the last few years. I say test Khawaja there with Clarke and Hussey at 5 and 6. Would break up the two right-handers currently at 3 and 4 too."
Billy: "Two Words.. Chris Hartley." Hartley certainly seems a popular choice among Cricinfo readers.
Gazza: "I'm origanaly from Darwin, Oz, and we played cricket between April and September, (Dry season). Why would they organise a test series in the wet season in S/L?" Well, the West Indies series was around the end of the year and that was almost completely wiped out. Any Sri Lankan readers to enlighten us on when the dry season in Sri Lanka is?
Ryan: "Johnson left SA last time as a cricketer who seemed to be on the cusp of being a genuine allrounder, 2 years later he will go back having not developed at all, and if anything, digressed. If anyone misses out test 3 it should be him, Let''s blood Pattinson!" Austrailian fans expect a lot, judging from the mails you'd think they are being thrashed in this series.
Albert votes for Hartley as well: "I'm not here to criticise Haddin, because we must remember his heroics in the Ashes, but I do agree that in light of the recent Argus review, Chris Hartley, a 'veteran' at 29 should be next in line given Paine's injury. As a reliable batsman that has been successful for the last couple of seasons for Queensland, he is one of, if not the most reliable glovemen in Australia."
"I am a club wicket keeper batsman here in Darwin. Gimme a go mate!" The world has been alerted to your talents, Dr Tam.
1.25pm Still raining in Pallekele. The umpires have just walked off the field.
Matt (not Wade): "I'm not completely defending Haddin who executed the shot poorly but it looks like Clarke might have told the batsman to hurry up because he wants a couple of overs at Sri Lanka tonight."
SchonJovi: "@William: If the new Argus review rewards performance, then shouldn't Chris HARTLEY from QLD be the next keeper. Easily the best gloveman and solid batsman."
Daniel: "If they dropped Katich after his efforts, I can only imagine the knives are out for Haddin."
1.20pm Groundstaff in position to bring on the covers. Umpires have a discussion and once again rain has stopped play. Large covers coming on. Expected to be a short, sharp shower. Lets hope it is.

James: "Benno, like it or not, Punter is coming to the end of his (distinguished) career. Marsh currently looks like a tailor made replacement at no 3."
 Innings Start
Thanks for your company over the five days people. That's all from us. This is Abhishek Purohit signing off, on behalf of Sid Monga and Sid Ravindran. Cheers and beware of the rain
3.45 pm And that's the end of the match as play has been called off, Dan Brettig informs us. Brydon Coverdale has summed it up in his report.
Jack: "Forget about all the rain, you can't help that... but its the laughable implementation of the bad light rule, when the ball is still visible and floodlights are available that has sealed this game." They should have carried on, should not matter that Galle and SSC don't have floodlights.
3.25 pm "It's time to move on," tweets Tony Greig. "You can close the book on this match," tweets Tom Moody
simon: "Hughes has had plenty of chances and Australia can not afford to stick with Johnson because he has a 1 in 5 chance of a successful match. Open with Marsh and break in a new pace bowler like Pattinson."
riley: "Do you think the Sri Lankan team are inside celebrating with Sangas while it's Pa-rain-avitaning?"
Robert Brown: "well thanks Tony, now i have to just wait for Sports Bet to make it official, and then see the Dollars roll into my betting account. Whiskey time."
Liam: "@CSB What must be remembered is they are playing Test cricket not first class cricket and Marsh has performed the best out of the 3 men."
Shasindu: "Note on the Sri Lankan attack, why isnt Nuwan Kulasekara having a go? Sure he doesnt have the speed of Mitchell Johnson but he has the accuracy of Watson which might prove to be critical for this Lankan bowling. True its good to have young talent but the bowling attack is lacking experience."
Shishank: "To end the fight i think Australia should drop both Hughes and Marsh/Khawaja for Ponting and take one more bowler to strengthen the bowling attack. Because at SSC in any case you dont need that many batsmen. You need at least 5 frontline bowlers to bowl a team out twice." Don't think they would want to do that considering Haddin's recent troubles with the bat
3.05 pm More showers, more covers now, says Dan Brettig. They were taking the covers off when the rain came back. Michael Clarke clearly has had enough of it, have a look.
CSB for real: "What must be remembered re: Marsh/Hughes/Khawaja debate is that Hughes and Khawaja are both much younger than Marsh, AND have more consistent First Class records to back it up. One swallow doesn't make a summer and all that."
bernie: "Why can't they build a retractable roof over Sri Lanka?"
Robert Brown: "Shield side with an attack weaker than Sri Lanka Easy, South Australian Red Backs, For sure, i live in South Australia and have watched them, they are poor, and Lyon could not get a shield game with them , that tells you a lot."
Jeremy: "hyclass - the Sri Lankan attack was good enough to get Hughes for not many, for the third time, and Watson, Clarke and Haddin. Yet its Marsh that has to go?"
Jarrod: "Ponting is showing signs of getting back into form so I don't think he should be dropped now. The batsman who should be under pressure is Clarke, but he's an excellent and brand new captain so that won't happen (yet). If I were to choose from the 3 young'uns, I would have to drop Hughes."
hyclass: "Name a Shield side with a weaker attack than than Sri Lanka. There isnt one. Marsh is ordinary. All this talk about him replacing people is rubbish, just like his record in 1st class cricket over 11 years." Didn't look remotely rubbish the way he ground out a debut hundred. He deserves a decent run, at the least
Jeremy: "They have to drop either Hughes or Khawaja. Little puzzled by the claim Khawaja hasn't done anything wrong - if a top score of 37 in 3 tests isn't doing anything wrong then I don't know what's going on. Meanwhile Hughes' terrible technique problems have always been excused by his heavy scoring, so what's the defence now he isn't scoring?"
Praveen: "Talking about SL i think we need to have Herath and Mendis for SSC and Eranga for 1 of the fast bowlers. Need some x factor in the bowling at SSC."
2.55 pm Covers are coming off slowly, tweets Tom Moody
CSB: "At least Steve Smith isn't in the team anymore, shows what a waste of a spot he was." That was coming
Damo: "Nick - tough call on Hughes - Im not convinced about him, but he has not had an extended run to prove either up to it or not. He should be given a decent chance and then a decision is made - I would say at the end of the South African series which would have been a run of 8 test matches since he was brought back in for Perth."
Jason: "I think it has to be Marsh or Hughes for the next match. Khawaja needs to stay at number 6, he has done nothing wrong, and with Haddin unable to bat longer than ten minutes recently he is going to be invaluable if we need someone to stay in and save a game, and also seems like he has no trouble batting with the tail."
Ben: "Unfortunately he can & he will be Damo & personally I think that is the best decision, 3 is punters spot & he deserves it back. Marsh was given an opportunity & has taken it with open hands, the selectors now truly know where to sit with him & he will be next in line, Hughes & Khawaja still have something to prove & the 3rd test is exactly where they can do that, personally would love to see Hughes cement the opening spot but at the moment he seems to just be batting to save his wicket for a spot instead of showing his true capabilities."
2.35 pm Still raining, says Dan Brettig
Sergio: "The Australians lost 2 series against England, not one. It's true, though, that they have great resources in reserve, and that Johnson is much better than most correspondents credit him."
Nick: "Do we think that Phil Hughes could be under pressure for Shaun Marsh ? Hughes has made a few starts this series but hasn't gone on to make a big score, Marsh to open with Watson, and Ponting to slot back into 3."
Gavan: "Forced to watch A Current Affair with no cricket on! Oh the humanity......."
Damo: "What about the next test - surely Marsh cannot be dropped for Ponting after getting 140 and Usman didnt fail due to lack of opportunity. I think Ricky will miss out on the 3rd test." Drop Ricky Ponting? Not happening
DukesJ: "Next to a win, this was the best result for Australia. Having been on top for the majority of the match (weather permitting), we now head to the flattest pitch in the country with a 1-0 lead. Not bad for a team that was tipped to be whitewashed..."
Ratheesh: "the transition of aussie team is amazing. wonder how many teams can do that. they talk about aussie downfall. and all they had lost was one series againts SA and one against england..." And against India
2.05 pm Our man Dan Brettig tweets: "Rain is heavy and so are Aus hearts." He now says that the ground is fully covered.
SS: "well this sets up the 3rd test nicely....SSC usually is a flat track with lots of high scoring draws, but with SL needing a win they might hv to ask the curator for a result wkt....repeat of the Galle backfire anyone?" Anything other than a snoozefest at SSC will do good for Test cricket
Glenn: "@Bart, How can you bag someone out or let alone a team out who have been in control this whole test match. Without rain this match wouldve been over already. And to talk down Marsh's ton in the first innings, you clearly have no idea. The guy is batting to make a point. He and Hussey came in when Australia was in trouble and he helped dig them out. I cannot believe you would belittle such a great knock."
Joe: "Its high time Sri Lanka Introduce some young blood into the test side. Players like Chandimal and Thirimanne should be given the opportunity."
SS: "well i am sure the aussies will take this washout better with the score as it stands now...imagine if they needed 100 to win and play ended with them on 80/2!!!! Clarke dropping Thilan cost them the match methinks....230/4 with a new ball....angelo n prasanna J wouldn't hv survived long...maybe 280-300 all out !"
Robert Brown: "Take it on the chin and stop your whinging, remember in the Ashes praying for rain, you cant have it both ways, what happens, happens."
Ben: "Should be looking at the positives. Have been in front all test...big step up from all the pre-series talk about how the Aussies would go. Well done boys!"
Sam: "@ Bart. Yeah your right. A sub 300 score would've been so much better."
Daniel: "I dont think the Australian public can get too disappointed about this drawing out after the US Open women's final."
And here is Hally now: "Mitchell Johnson as a test bowler is no longer a force to be reckoned with. He lacks penetration and bowls too loosely to build any sort of pressure, relying on bowling the wicket ball too often. He has really let down Australia this test and come to think of it the last test as well. If he bowled anywhere close to what we have seen in the past, the Lankans would already be congratulating the Aussies on a win. Why he is so good at ODI and not tests is beyond me."
Julien: "Whilst it is unfortunate that rain will decide the result of this Test match, no one can say that the Aussies didn't have enough time to bowl the Sri Lankans out. We simply lacked the wicket-taking options. Hopefully weather won't be used as an excuse in the aftermath of the game." Never satisfied, are you, Julien, et tu Bart?
Bart: "So do we still talk up Marsh's 300 ball (don't forget that's 50 overs.. 50!) vigil? Probably cost Australia the match. If you know weather will be an issue, which we all did, make an effort to win."
Nitin: "Why can't we have a reserve day for test matches for making up for the hours lost due to bad weather?"
Lex: "You had to feel for the Lankans as their batting concentration is getting hampered by thses intermittent downpours."
Damian: "Well its the late monsoon for south-west Sri Lanka and normally that means the hill capital (Kandy) get lots of rain fall, so by the looks of it and the weather around the Central Province this will be the End of This Test Match."
1.50 pm The rain has come in now and the covers are coming on. Clarke has a disgusted look on his face. He is still on the field, the Sri Lanka batsmen have gone off. More covers coming on now, it is raining heavily in the distance
Robert: "I backed the Draw 2 days ago."
Samal: "By looking at the weather around Kandy today, this might be the end of this test match......"
