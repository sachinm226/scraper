Data
Amazing scenes here at Lord's as Australia are bowled out on the first day having faced just 40.2 overs. Stephen Harmison came to the party - 5 for 43 - and wrecked Australia
This is Harmison's 6th five-wicket haul. But he did not work alone, he was well supported by Hoggard, Jones and Flintoff
There will be a short break as England prepare to bat. Don't go anywhere though, there's sure to be more excitement soon!

8.6;?;Harmison to Langer, no run on the pads this time, tucking Langer up a bit, off the pad to the off side;

4.6;?;Harmison to Hayden, no run slightly fuller but well directed just outside the off stump, left alone to the keeper. End of a fine overfrom Harmison!;
4.5;?;Harmison to Hayden, no run and Harmison bangs another one in! This time Hayden leaves it alone. The crowd loves it and roars in apprciation of Harmison.;

4.1;?;Harmison to Langer, no run just short of a good length and outside the off, good bounce and carry. This time Langer decides to take the safe option and leaves the ball alone instead of havving a big heave;
3.6;?;Hoggard to Hayden, no run Much better ball this time around, on the off and swinging in a touch, Hayden drives back but Hoggard fields in his follow-through and flings the ball back towards the stumps;
3.5;?;Hoggard to Hayden, no run once again just slipping onto the pads, Hoggard wants to avoid that. Hayden jabs it awkwardly to the on-side;

Match State: Match start scheduled for 10.30am local time (9.30am GMT)
A big hello and a very warm welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the biggest Ashes series in a long, long time.
The day everyone has been waiting for - July 21 - has finally arrived, and it is a perfect one for cricket.
Lord's, the cathedral of cricket, is bathed in sunshine, and the stage is well and truly set. The moment of reckoning is
near.
No series has generated as much interest in recent time, and the time for talk is well and truly over.
In a short while Michael Vaughan, the captain of a resurgent England team, will walk out to toss with Ricky Ponting, leading
Australia for the first time in an Ashes series
Before every Ashes series the hype is overwhelming, but this time around the excitement is real, for England have the guns
in their armoury to stand up to Australia.
Ponting acknowledges as much in his pre-match press conference, when he said:
An Shes series is the biggest an Australia team ever plays and this one made more special by the way England team have played of late.
England would do well to remember that Australia have not lost a Test match at Lord's since 1934.
But, history is one thing, and today truly is a new day.
Steve Harmison has proven himself as one of the best fast bowlers in the world
He is well supported by Andrew Flintoff, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones and Ashley Giles.
England's batting is also at its healthy best - Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss get things under way.
The classy Vaughan comes in at one-drop, followed by the promising and solid with Ian Bell at No. 4.
The real explosiveness is in the middle order with Kevin Pietersen
Geriant Jones, whose batting has never been in doubt tops off a most capable line-up.
But let's not get too carried away just yet.
Man for man Australia has the personnel to do as well or better than the England team.
Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden have plundered English bowlers for years now.
Hayden won't be pleased at suggestions that he is past his best and will want to prove a point.
Ricky Ponting struggled for form at the start of the summer but roared back just in time
Damien Martyn was at his silken best in the warm-up match against Leicestershire, scoring 154.
Simon Katich is the strong, silent type in the middle order, all solidity
Then there's the flash and excitement of Michael Clarke, who comes in one place behind Katich.
Just when you've had enough of the Australian batting line-up, out walks Adam Gilchrist, the most destructive batsman in world cricket today
The bowlers are no chumps either - Shane Warne for spin, Glenn McGrath, the eternal nemesis of English batsman, Brett Lee in barnstorming form and Jason Gillespie keen as anything to do well and silence his critics
We're happy to tell you the captains have now made their way out to the middle for the toss, accompanied by Ranjan
Madugalle, the former Sri Lankan cricketer, and match referee for the series
News has just come in that Australia have won the toss and chosen to bat.
Not particularly surprising considering the pitch at Lord's is traditionally good for batting to start with
To recap, here are the teams for you:
Australia: Langer, Hayden, Ponting, Martyn, Clarke, Katich, Gilchrist, Warne, Lee, Gillespie, McGrath
England: Trescothick, Strauss, Vaughan, Bell, Pietersen, Flintoff, Geriant Jones, Giles, Hoggard, Harmison, Simon Jones
The players are on the field now
Michael Vaughan has his players around him in a huddle, going through a last pre-match chat
Hayden and Langer now stride onto the field
The appreciative and healthy crowd at Lord's cheers as this game is about to get under way
It will be Justin Langer taking first strike and he will face Steve Harmison
 Innings Start
End of the England innings and they still trail by 35
But Australia will not be especially pleased at the number of runs the England tail added
63 runs scored off 11.1 overs this morning
Australia will bat in their second innings shortly. That should be in about 10 minutes.
This is Anand Vasu, your commentator, signing off very briefly. See you again in about 10 minutes!

 Innings Start
And that, is the end of that! Australia have taken a 1-0 lead in this Ashes series
In fine style Australia have pulled off a win at Lord's
England were hopeful their resurgent team could take the fight to Australia. But the scorebook shows that Australia wrapped up victory by 239 runs in just a shade over three days
England have a lot of work to do if they are to pull things back in this series. Ricky Ponting and his men don't often let go of a lead when they have it ...
There's no need to look too far for the Man of the Match. When Australia were in deep trouble after being bowled out for 190 Glenn McGrath cut England to ribbons. His 9 for 82 in this match are his best figures in a Test in England.
We're just waiting for the presentation ceremony ... It should begin any time soon
In the meantime do tell us what you thought of the match, and of our coverage: http://www.cricinfo.com/commentary.html
Michael Vaughan of England, the losing captain, comes forward to have a chat:
It's been a tough game. Good effort to bowl out Australia for 190. Then McGrath bowled well and took it away from us.'
'You have to give credit to Harmison, McGrath, Lee and Warne who bowled well and put pressure on the batsmen in this wicket. Pietersen's batting on debut was outstanding.'
'Bit of pressure and perhaps a lack of concentration,' says Vaughan on the number of dropped catches
Now the winning captain, Ricky Ponting, comes forward to have a chat
'Very good Test win for us. After being bowled out for 190 to bounce back like that was a sign of the quality of the players in our team. McGrath and Warne bowled outstandingly.'
'Both teams were out their trying to put a stamp on the series early on. England bowled well. It was a tough contest and you like that.'
'They always do the job for us, particularly in big matches.' says Ponting of Warne and McGrath
And it's official. The Man of the Match is Glenn McGrath
'To have the chance to take my 500th wicket here, not much can beat that,' says McGrath
McGrath waves out to the crowd who give him some warm applause and that is the end of proceedings at Lord's
This is Anand Vasu, your commentator, saying goodbye, thanking you for being with us for this cracking match!
It was tremendous fun bringing the game to you. We hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. Do write in to us at http://www.cricinfo.com/commentary.html
