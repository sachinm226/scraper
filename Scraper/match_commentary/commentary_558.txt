Data
So Australia end on 263. Certainly an underpar total, but England's openers will need to be alert: Hilfenhaus and Co. swing it too. Anderson leads off his troops after finishing with five wickets. Righto, so join Brydon in about ten minutes for the reply - and a reminder that tea is at 4.10pm today.
70.4;W;Onions to Hilfenhaus, OUT got him! Another slapping drive finds Swann in the gully, and that's the final wicket for Onions who finishes with four wickets;Ben Hilfenhaus c Swann b Onions 20 (37m 31b 4x4 0x6) SR: 64.51;
70.3;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run oh well bowled, good comeback. Beats him with a fine outswinger;
70.2;4;Onions to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs top shot, that! Short, wide and clattered over backward point with a, well, a clatter;
70.1;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run goes back to defend on the back foot;
69.6;?;Flintoff to Hauritz, no run;
69.5;1;Flintoff to Hilfenhaus, 1 run angled down to third man;
69.4;?;Flintoff to Hilfenhaus, no run wide and he ducks away from it slightly oddly, and realises how daft he looks, nearly wafting the bat while on his knees;
69.3;1;Flintoff to Hauritz, 1 run nicely driven, that, out through extra cover;
69.2;?;Flintoff to Hauritz, no run another bouncer and he ducks once more;
69.1;?;Flintoff to Hauritz, no run a bouncer and it's ducked beneath by Haley Osment;
68.6;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run beaten once again outside off, superb delivery;
68.5;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run beaten by a lifter outside off;
68.4;1;Onions to Hauritz, 1 run short of a length and defended on the back foot;
68.3;2;Onions to Hauritz, 2 runs well, that's too straight really, and flicked off his pads;
68.2;?;Onions to Hauritz, no run big, late, massive swing wide of the off stump;
68.1;?;Onions to Hauritz, no run defended on the back foot;
67.6;?;Flintoff to Hilfenhaus, no run short, wide, left alone;
67.5;?;Flintoff to Hilfenhaus, no run a wide, un-Flintoffish leg-cutter;
67.4;?;Flintoff to Hilfenhaus, no run good line and it's defended to gully;
67.3;?;Flintoff to Hilfenhaus, no run much too wide. Flintoff's travails today continue. He looks about as enthused as an asthmatic tortoise;
67.2;1;Flintoff to Hauritz, 1 run worked to leg;
67.1;?;Flintoff to Hauritz, no run touch wide and left alone;
66.6;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run better length, swinging away and beating the house of Hilfen;
66.5;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run well defended, getting right back in line;
66.4;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;
66.3;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run driven to gully;
66.2;1;Onions to Hauritz, 1 run in the slot, driven hard to the off side;
66.1;?;Onions to Hauritz, no run left alone;
65.6;2;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, 2 runs Hilfenhaus was several minutes too late on this one, but still got it away to leg. What a legend;
65.5;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run sharp bouncer, Hilfenhaus temporarily thinks he's Viv Richards and attempts to hit him into the street but misses. Good intent, though. Just give it a whack;
65.4;4;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs bosh - take that! Good, tailend humpty-dumpty hitting. Cracked over extra cover. You can't beat tailenders swinging the bat - much entertainment;
65.3;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run booming inswinger, but well defended by Hilfenhaus;
65.2;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run left alone by Hilfenhaus, comfortably so;
65.1;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run wide of the off stump. Too wide;
64.6;?;Onions to Hauritz, no run another leg-side loosener;
64.5;4b;Onions to Hauritz, 4 byes woops! Rotten stray down the leg side and it swings away from poor old Prior;
64.4;?;Onions to Hauritz, no run smashed out to the off side;
64.3;1;Onions to Hilfenhaus, 1 run short of a length, he mis-hooks it out to extra cover and Bopara's giving chase and ought to take it comfortably. But drops it! What a clanger. Bopara's having a rubbish series, to be honest; he looks a distracted figure in the field and his fielding hasn't been blemish-free all series;
64.2;1;Onions to Hauritz, 1 run slapped uppishly past point. Good tailend flapping, this;
64.1;?;Onions to Hauritz, no run beaten outside off - good leg-cutter;
63.6;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run shorter ball wide of the off stump;
63.5;4;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs well he's timed that! A squirt outside off which flies through point for four more!;
63.4;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run dug out again - good, straight, inswinging toe-crusher;
63.3;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run;
63.2;4;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, FOUR runs full and fast and dug out, with a thick outside edge flying past gully;
63.1;1;Anderson to Hauritz, 1 run good, straight delivery that's defended on the back foot;
62.6;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run safely negotiated on the back foot;
62.5;?;Onions to Hilfenhaus, no run oh beaten by a total, rip-snorting jaffa that angled in and swung away. You just cannot play that;
62.4;1;Onions to Hauritz, 1 run clipped to leg;
62.4;1w;Onions to Hauritz, 1 wide oh dear. Miles wide of the off stump - Onions saw Hauritz move;
62.3;?;Onions to Hauritz, no run swings wildly down the leg side;
62.2;?;Onions to Hauritz, no run just outside off and punched out to cover;
62.1;?;Onions to Hauritz, no run short of a length and fends it to leg, awkwardly;
61.6;?;Anderson to Hilfenhaus, no run ignored outside off;
61.5;W;Anderson to Siddle, OUT fantastic delivery, swinging in, then straightening a touch on the right-hander who tries to work it through midwicket but gets a thick outside edge for Anderson's five;Peter Siddle c ?Prior b Anderson 13 (31m 26b 2x4 0x6) SR: 50;
61.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run defended on the front foot out to point;
61.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run crunched to mid-off;
61.2;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run a beauty. Such a good ball. As Trueman would've said, "that were wasted on thee, lad";
61.1;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run defended on the back foot;
60.6;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run wide of the mark. Broad's probably had enough I think. Or rather, Strauss has had enough of him;
60.5;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run short of a length and defended out to the off side;
60.4;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run an outswinging half-volley crunched to mid-off. Hauritz is more than useful with the bat. Solid defensive technique and looks quite orthodox when driving;
60.3;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run defended on the back foot;
60.2;1;Broad to Siddle, 1 run pushes forward to defend, the ball ending up at gully;
60.1;3;Broad to Hauritz, 3 runs that's runs, that is. Lovely extra-cover drive, if not quite timing it well enough for four. Onions gives chase and does well;
59.6;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run edged but short of the third slip;
59.5;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run again this bends back into Siddle who pushes it out quite competently out to the off side;
59.4;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run another inswinger but not quite yorker-length;
59.3;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run superb delivery - excellent cricket all round. A phat, inswinging yorker innit and he dug it out excellently;
59.2;1;Anderson to Hauritz, 1 run too straight and it swings in late on Hauritz who flicks it through midwicket;
59.1;4;Anderson to Hauritz, FOUR runs a filthy half-tracker from Anderson and slapped, tonked, boshed, flapped over extra cover for four! Take that, son. Bosh;
58.6;?;Broad to Siddle, no run defended on the back foot;
58.5;4;Broad to Siddle, FOUR runs edged past gully for four! Played with softish hands, but nevertheless was not in control of that poke on the front foot. Collingwood didn't have a hope of stopping it;
58.4;4;Broad to Siddle, FOUR runs but it's too straight here and shovelled through midwicket for four by Siddle - that's a top shot, not looking to hit it too hard and timing it superbly;
58.3;?;Broad to Siddle, no run and he's beaten him once more with a fine outswinger! This is much better from Broad, much better length;
58.2;?;Broad to Siddle, no run nice shape away from the batsman from Broad. Good outswinger;
58.1;?;Broad to Siddle, no run slightly wider of the crease, angling into the right-hander;
57.6;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run big shout to a booming, zooming, looming inswinger but it's going down leg;
57.5;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run worked to mid-on where Bell lurks, stops, fields, and does well;
57.4;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run an elegant and surprisingly powerful drive to mid-off;
57.3;1;Anderson to Siddle, 1 run dropped out to cover, this'll be close if the fielder hits - and he doesn't! Bopara did well, if you can say that considering he missed. Well backed-up by Broad;
57.2;1;Anderson to Hauritz, 1 run booming inswinger but too straight. Flicked nicely behind square;
57.1;1;Anderson to Siddle, 1 run ooh that was close. Siddle walked across his stumps to this inswinger, a dangerous tactic, but played it well enough in the end;
56.6;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run defended on the back foot;
56.5;1;Broad to Siddle, 1 run on middle stump and nudged to leg - Bell gets onto it and this'll be out if he hits! But, no, for the second time today Big Game Belly (? A Miller) misses;
56.4;?;Broad to Siddle, no run beautiful delivery! Lovely outswinger which drew him into a drive and he missed it completely. That's the length when it's swinging;
56.3;?;Broad to Siddle, no run wide of the crease again, and he delivers a wider delivery that Siddle thinks about playing but chooses not to;
56.2;?;Broad to Siddle, no run wide of the crease and angling into the right-hander who defends;
56.1;?;Broad to Siddle, no run good ball, just nibbling away and beating him on the outside edge. Better from Broad. He must keep pitching it up;
55.6;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run big, booming, wonderful inswinger!;
55.5;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run a massive, thick inside edge which threatens to castle him, but his boot saves him. Better line from Jimmy A;
55.4;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run bouncer, and a tame one, sailing way over his head;
55.3;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run late swing again troubles him, but he plays it back to the bowler;
55.2;1;Anderson to Siddle, 1 run angling in to Siddle before it swings away late, and he's nearly squared up but squeezes it out to the off side. A run is stolen;
55.1;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run Siddle is on the back foot and defending on the tips of his toes;
54.6;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run wow - that sprung from nowhere! Tennis-ball bounce off a length;
54.5;2lb;Broad to Hauritz, 2 leg byes flicked off his legs;
54.4;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run well, a touch too wide really from Broad. Left alone;
54.3;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run just outside off and left alone;
54.2;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run down the leg side;
54.1;2;Broad to Hauritz, 2 runs punched out to the off side;
53.6;?;Anderson to Siddle, no run ooh good leave! Sharp inducker which is left alone;
53.5;W;Anderson to Manou, OUT wow! What a delivery! Anderson comes a touch wider and gets the ball to straighten and it comprehensively smashes Manou's off stump, that is almost the perfect ball.;Graham Manou b Anderson 8 (20m 11b 2x4 0x6) SR: 72.72;
53.4;?;Anderson to Manou, no run and there's the big curving inswinger, the same thing that did for Clarke, but this one is heading down leg, which is lucky for Manou as he didn't get bat on it;
53.3;?;Anderson to Manou, no run defended away to cover this time;
53.2;?;Anderson to Manou, no run no shot to an outswinger;
53.1;?;Anderson to Manou, no run pushed to point and can't beat the field;
52.6;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run pushed to cover this time and there's no run;
52.5;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run leaves another one outside off;
52.4;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run and again no shot to an outswinger;
52.3;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run no shot offered once again;
52.2;?;Broad to Hauritz, no run outswinger, left alone outside off;
52.1;1lb;Broad to Manou, 1 leg bye an lbw appeal this time but that one is swinging down leg;
51.6;?;Anderson to Hauritz, no run and he survives, Anderson swings it in but just too leg-side and it bounces off Hauritz's thigh;
51.5;W;Anderson to Johnson, OUT oh he's gone too! Swings back in to Johnson, who is in two minds whether to leave it - he does leave it - and it hits him above the knee-roll;Mitchell Johnson lbw b Anderson 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
51.4;W;Anderson to North, OUT wonderful catch! Prior makes a super take diving to his left across first slip. Fullish ball swinging away from North, who got a thick edge to one that he might have left alone;Marcus North c ?Prior b Anderson 12 (63m 49b 1x4 0x6) SR: 24.48;
51.3;?;Anderson to North, no run nudged away to point;
51.2;?;Anderson to North, no run punched to cover and there's no run;
51.1;?;Anderson to North, no run not much swing there, North leaves outside off;
50.6;?;Broad to Manou, no run guided to point;
50.5;?;Broad to Manou, no run wide-ish outswinger, Manou leaves it;
50.4;4;Broad to Manou, FOUR runs no lack of confidence here from Manou, he gets a short one from Broad and pulls it hard forward of square leg for a boundary, and on its way it clips the fingers of Bell at short leg. Wow, I guess that's technically dropped, but Bell was sensibly ducking to save doing himself a mischief.;
50.3;1;Broad to North, 1 run clipped away to leg for a single;
50.2;?;Broad to North, no run left alone outside off;
50.1;?;Broad to North, no run defended safely back down the pitch;
49.6;4;Anderson to Manou, FOUR runs and Manou gets off the mark in Tests with a leg-glance off his hips for four;
49.5;?;Anderson to Manou, no run left alone outside off for his first ball;
49.4;W;Anderson to Clarke, OUT oh he's got him! A huge inswinger here, curves late and strikes Clarke on middle and leg, Rudi Koertzen lifts the finger;Michael Clarke lbw b Anderson 29 (94m 55b 4x4 0x6) SR: 52.72;
49.3;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run swinging down leg here, Clarke can't work it off his hips;
49.2;1;Anderson to North, 1 run good running, North drops it into the off side and they take off quickly, both men are safely home;
49.1;?;Anderson to North, no run outside off, North defends;
48.6;1;Broad to North, 1 run on the pads and North clips to deep square leg;
48.5;?;Broad to North, no run better line, on off stump, North defends;
48.4;1lb;Broad to Clarke, 1 leg bye clipped off his pads this time, and in fact it's a leg-bye;
48.3;?;Broad to Clarke, no run straight-bat defence this time;
48.2;4;Broad to Clarke, FOUR runs really good cover drive this, it's an outswinger right on that drivable length and Clark punches between cover and mid-off;
48.1;2;Broad to Clarke, 2 runs starts with a fullish outswinger that Clarke drives square for a couple;
47.6;?;Anderson to North, no run a similar line and again North doesn't have to play;
47.5;?;Anderson to North, no run pushed across again and North leaves;
47.4;?;Anderson to North, no run straighter, but still outside off, and North lets it go;
47.3;?;Anderson to North, no run Anderson pushes this one far too wide across North, who isn't even slightly interested in playing at that;
47.2;?;Anderson to North, no run nice bit of outswing to the left-hander there, left alone;
47.1;?;Anderson to North, no run left alone outside off;
46.6;1lb;Onions to North, 1 leg bye swinging down leg, North gets a thick bit of pad on that and it runs fine;
46.5;3;Onions to Clarke, 3 runs nice pull there from Clarke, he just turned this one from off stump through midwicket and it was well reeled in by Bell on the boundary;
46.4;?;Onions to Clarke, no run down leg side now, Clarke doesn't get anything on it;
46.3;?;Onions to Clarke, no run dropped! Oh dear, that's bad cricket from batsman and fielder. A good outswinger from Onions, Clarke shapes to leave but is too slow and the ball runs off the face of the bat straight to second slip, where Flintoff grasses a pretty straightforward chance;
46.2;?;Onions to Clarke, no run good length, seams back in to Clarke, who defends;
46.1;?;Onions to Clarke, no run strays down leg side, Clarke can't get bat on it;
45.6;?;Anderson to North, no run no shot offered to ball that drifts away from the left-hander;
45.5;?;Anderson to North, no run better ball, pulls the length back a touch and gets it to straighten on line, North defends;
45.4;4;Anderson to North, FOUR runs lovely cover drive, angled across North and it didn't swing, so the batsman punched it superbly between cover and mid-off;
45.3;?;Anderson to North, no run angled bat here from North, who defends to off;
45.2;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run on line this time, Clarke flicks it through square leg wristily;
45.1;1;Anderson to North, 1 run swinging in again, North clips it comfortably through the leg side;
44.6;3;Onions to North, 3 runs swivels a pull nicely through midwicket here to pick up three runs;
44.5;?;Onions to North, no run outside off and prodded back down the pitch - or should that be the wicket, as Steve Rouse described the 'pitch' as jelly-like the other day, and says he was referring to the outfield as opposed to the playing strip;
44.4;?;Onions to North, no run driven back down the pitch;
44.3;?;Onions to North, no run oops, well bowled but not well played, swinging back in and North seems to leave it to crash into his thigh, half thinking about playing a shot at the same time;
44.2;?;Onions to North, no run another punchy drive, this time straight to cover;
44.1;?;Onions to North, no run swinging in to North's middle stump, he drives confidently but straight to mid-on;
43.6;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run a hint of outswing, Clarke drives to cover and it's well fielded;
43.5;1lb;Anderson to North, 1 leg bye swinging down leg this time, North gets pad on it and gets a leg-bye;
43.4;?;Anderson to North, no run angled wider across North this time, he leaves it;
43.3;?;Anderson to North, no run nice line again, swinging back in but a touch outside off and North leaves;
43.2;?;Anderson to North, no run solid in defence again, another good ball on off stump;
43.1;?;Anderson to North, no run swinging in to North here, right on off stump and he defends;
42.6;?;Onions to Clarke, no run hmm, some curvy inswing there, but it still ended up outside off and Clarke could leave it;
42.5;1;Onions to North, 1 run he does indeed, works this one off his hips behind square to get off the mark after 15 balls and 23 minutes;
42.4;?;Onions to North, no run on the hips, North can't get it away for a single;
42.3;1;Onions to Clarke, 1 run angled in to the pads, Clarke clips it through midwicket;
42.2;?;Onions to Clarke, no run leans forward and pushes to cover-point;
42.1;?;Onions to Clarke, no run straight ball from Onions, Clarke defends with a straight bat;
41.6;?;Anderson to North, no run defended on the back foot;
41.5;?;Anderson to North, no run again this doesn't swing. Wide of the off stump;
41.4;?;Anderson to North, no run wide of the off stump and it holds its line;
41.3;?;Anderson to North, no run that's wide and doesn't swing and is left alone;
41.2;?;Anderson to North, no run oh well bowled! That bent back markedly, prodigiously on the left-hander! Huge swing for Anderson;
41.1;?;Anderson to North, no run well wide - too wide;
40.6;?;Onions to Clarke, no run swings back very, very late indeed on the right-hander. This is excellent control, as much as anything, from Onions;
40.5;?;Onions to Clarke, no run just outside off, Clarke doesn't know whether to leave it or play at it;
40.4;?;Onions to Clarke, no run cuts back sharply and England let out a noise that could probably be heard in London. London in Canada. Beautiful off-cutter which cut back sharp and that is so, so close! Looked to me like it was taking out middle-and-leg;
40.3;?;Onions to Clarke, no run short of a length and outside off, Clarke punches it to cover. High front elbow, and as orthodox as you could wish to see;
40.2;?;Onions to Clarke, no run swings away from the right-hander;
40.1;4;Onions to Clarke, FOUR runs shot! He's so good off his legs, and clips it powerfully and elegantly through midwicket. Superb stroke!;
39.6;?;Anderson to North, no run ignored outside off;
39.5;?;Anderson to North, no run this does shape back into North, but down the leg side;
39.4;?;Anderson to North, no run angled across the left-hander who leaves well alone;
39.3;?;Anderson to North, no run on middle-and off and swinging away from him;
39.2;?;Anderson to North, no run short of a length, North pats it off the back foot;
39.1;?;Anderson to North, no run starts with a loosener wide of North's off stump;
38.6;?;Onions to Clarke, no run fantastic delivery! Clarke's lucky to still be alive there. Outswinger, one of the few deliveries this morning that has swung prodigiously, and that beats Clarke's fishy waft;
38.5;?;Onions to Clarke, no run ooh very well bowled on the off stump. Clarke defends, well back in his crease;
38.4;1b;Onions to North, 1 bye cuts back on North a touch - significant movement after it passed North, and that beats Prior too;
38.3;W;Onions to Ponting, OUT got him! He's out! A quick bouncer, Ponting went for a hook and got a thin edge through to Prior. Onions has bowled so, so well this morning;Ricky Ponting c ?Prior b Onions 38 (88m 47b 5x4 0x6) SR: 80.85;
38.2;?;Onions to Ponting, no run bouncer down the leg side;
38.1;?;Onions to Ponting, no run straight delivery and good pace, too. Ponting turns it to leg on the back foot;
37.6;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run flashed to point;
37.6;1nb;Flintoff to Clarke, (no ball) ooh that is desperately close to both bowling him and trapping him leg-before but it's a no-ball. Off-cutter...and the no-ball saves Clarke there;
37.5;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run no, too wide;
37.4;2;Flintoff to Clarke, 2 runs short of a length and punched out to the off side for a single;
37.3;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run short of a length and blocked out to the off side;
37.2;1;Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run punched out to cover and Ponting calls for a single, and this'll be out if Bell hits. Well out. Close! But home;
37.1;4;Flintoff to Ponting, FOUR runs Flintoff altered his delivery, sending it down with a double-whirl of the arm, but Ponting's played that beautifully through midwicket for four. Too straight;
36.6;?;Onions to Clarke, no run on the off stump and defended;
36.5;?;Onions to Clarke, no run another leg-cutter but wide of the off stump;
36.4;?;Onions to Clarke, no run well bowled again, Onions just finding one to straighten on Clarke. Almost a fast legbreak, that, and very nearly squares Clarke up fatally;
36.3;?;Onions to Clarke, no run wide and left alone. Leg-cutter. Or leg-cudder, as Richie would say;
36.2;?;Onions to Clarke, no run another leg-cutter but it's too wide;
36.1;?;Onions to Clarke, no run the yorker. The first of the day. And dealt with comfortably by Clarke;
35.6;2;Flintoff to Ponting, 2 runs cuts back late on Ponting who turns his wrists elegantly, and very late, to steal two to fine leg;
35.5;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run very good line and defended to Bell at point. Very solidly defended, too;
35.4;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run left alone outside off;
35.3;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run on the back foot, this time, Ponting's giving a lesson in orthodoxy of defence. Which, in isolation, is fascinating to watch; the plays within plays is what drew me to Test cricket in the first place;
35.2;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run that's better, shaping in on Ponting's off stump and he defends solidly, though it almost took the splice of his bat...as it often does with Flintoff given his height;
35.1;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run much too wide. Flintoff's radar is on the blink;
34.6;?;Onions to Clarke, no run fast leg-cutter with nice carry to Prior. Shoulders arms;
34.5;?;Onions to Clarke, no run on middle-and-off, Clarke - slightly squared up, both feet pointing down the pitch - defends;
34.4;3;Onions to Ponting, 3 runs walks across his stumps to work this through midwicket. Ponting lively today, keen to keep the board ticking. And so it is;
34.3;?;Onions to Ponting, no run nice and full and stroked out to cover;
34.2;?;Onions to Ponting, no run ideal line and length. Ponting's forward, offering an ideal defensive too;
34.1;2;Onions to Ponting, 2 runs hurries Ponting onto a pull who plays it with one hand off the bat. A mis-pull, if you like, and fortunately it lands safely at midwicket;
33.6;2;Flintoff to Clarke, 2 runs elegant flick off his pads;
33.5;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run fuller delivery that's left alone;
33.4;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run short delivery, Clarke hops back and defends;
33.3;4;Flintoff to Clarke, FOUR runs he reached for that, Clarke, but his off-side play this summer has been quite majestic. Four to him, and though he played it a long way from his body, such was the timing that it shot to the extra-cover boundary;
33.2;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run bouncer. He ducks. The crowd roar.;
33.1;3;Flintoff to Ponting, 3 runs Ponting flicks past short-leg and only by a whisker. An absolute whisker! But Ponting becomes Australia's leading run-scorer in Test matches and he acknowledges the warm applause from a grateful and knowledgeable Birmingham crowd. A wonderful moment for him and the crowd;
32.6;?;Onions to Clarke, no run wide and left alone outside off;
32.5;1;Onions to Ponting, 1 run solid, confident, aggressive drive to Broad at mid-off;
32.4;?;Onions to Ponting, no run very straight, Ponting tries to work it to leg but is rapped high on the thigh, or possibly the midriff;
32.3;4;Onions to Ponting, FOUR runs outside edge for four! Ponting came lunging forward, as he has done all his career, though he did open the face;
32.2;1;Onions to Clarke, 1 run another very good line on off stump, just straightening a touch, but well played by Clarke and well run, a single to cover;
32.1;1;Onions to Ponting, 1 run excellent line on middle stump and Ponting walks across his stumps and flicks to mid-on. Onions throws his hands up in the air in anguish, but that's such a Ponting shot;
31.6;4;Flintoff to Clarke, FOUR runs inside edge down the leg side. Clarke, understandably nervous about getting forward to Flintoff, especially nervous given the two shock wickets that have brought him to the crease, flicked it very late and past the keeper;
31.5;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run comfortably left alone;
31.4;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run left alone outside off. No movement for Flintoff who, at the moment at least, looks a bit stiff;
31.3;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run a stray down the leg side;
31.2;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run good length but again wide enough for Clarke to leave alone;
31.1;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run a touch too wide of the off stump and left alone;
31.1;1w;Flintoff to Clarke, 1 wide a bouncer, but a very short one. The crowd all cry "ooh," and Clarke probably did too, and it's wided on length;
30.6;1;Onions to Clarke, 1 run and that's flicked to leg but he was late on it;
30.5;?;Onions to Clarke, no run nicely played out on the front foot to point, but that's a very good line and length;
30.4;?;Onions to Clarke, no run ooh, a ripper! That's a brute, cutting back and bouncing - significant bounce for Onions in this over. And it's moving around off the seam;
30.3;?;Onions to Clarke, no run that wasn't far away at all! A quick bouncer, misdirected down the leg side, and Clarke wasn't far away from gloving that;
30.2;W;Onions to Hussey, OUT he's bowled him! He's bowled him! Hussey has left a straight one and his off stump is pegged back! What a disastrous start for Australia;Michael Hussey b Onions 0 (1m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;
30.1;W;Onions to Watson, OUT got him first ball! Cut back sharply on Watson who was a little late on this good, quick and straight delivery and that's out!;Shane Watson lbw b Onions 62 (130m 106b 10x4 0x6) SR: 58.49;
29.6;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run and Ponting isn't made to play, left alone outside off, and that's stumps on the first day;
29.5;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run ooh and that could've flown into gully's hands - again Ponting lunged forward massively, as he does, but it's always dangerous against someone of Flintoff's height. Fell short of gully;
29.4;4;Flintoff to Ponting, FOUR runs edged, or steered, past gully - played all along the ground. Sheesh, runs really have flown today;
29.3;1;Flintoff to Watson, 1 run dropped out to the off side for a quick single;
29.2;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run too wide and left alone;
29.1;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run bouncer down the leg side;
28.6;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run nudged to leg;
28.5;?;Anderson to Watson, no run good carry - it's fairly flying through at the moment;
28.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run shuffles back to defend, albeit with both feet pointing down the pitch;
28.3;1;Anderson to Ponting, 1 run terrific surprise straighter ball shaping back into Ponting but he plays it well enough, nurdling to leg and getting right forward on the front foot;
28.2;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run well wide and swinging wider still;
28.1;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run just a tad wide. Ergo, left alone;
27.6;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run good bounce and carry again, Watson leaves it outside off;
27.5;?;Flintoff to Watson, no run defended straight back down the pitch;
27.4;1;Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run Ponting swivels a pull around to fine leg;
27.3;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run left alone outside off stump this time;
27.2;1;Flintoff to Watson, 1 run on the pads again, Watson clips through square leg;
27.1;1;Flintoff to Ponting, 1 run a touch straight this time, Ponting works a single to midwicket;
26.6;?;Anderson to Watson, no run driven back down to mid-off;
26.5;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs clipped off his hips nicely to fine-leg for a boundary, that ball was just a bit too straight;
26.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run Anderson continues to probe outside off, Watson bunts it to cover;
26.3;?;Anderson to Watson, no run again Watson angles the bat and guides it to gully;
26.2;?;Anderson to Watson, no run guided down into the ground this time to gully;
26.1;4;Anderson to Watson, FOUR runs shouts of 'catch' here as Watson cuts hard, it wasn't very wide of gully at all there, but would have required something magical from Swann to reach it all the same;
25.6;4;Flintoff to Ponting, FOUR runs well placed by Ponting here, Flintoff tries for the yorker but it's a fraction too full and he drives it wide of mid-on;
25.5;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run Flintoff really bending his back here, that bounces a lot and Ponting lets it go;
25.4;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run 89.5mph or 144kph there from Flintoff, Ponting lets it go;
25.3;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run no shot offered outside off again;
25.2;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run good bounce from Flintoff, Ponting lets it go outside off;
25.1;?;Flintoff to Ponting, no run a hint of inswing and Ponting defends;
24.6;?;Anderson to Watson, no run defended to off;
24.5;2;Anderson to Watson, 2 runs and there's the half-century for Watson with a clip off his pads to mid-on and a misfield lets them get through for a couple;
24.4;?;Anderson to Watson, no run pushes to off and thinks of a single for the half-century, but then roars a 'no!", sensibly;
24.3;1;Anderson to Ponting, 1 run groans from England as Ponting drives at this one and gets a thick inside edge between the stumps and his body;
24.2;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run lunges forward to defend this one;
24.1;4;Anderson to Ponting, FOUR runs crunching back-foot cut through cover-point there, Ponting was given width and was quickly onto it;
23.6;?;Broad to Watson, no run good length, Watson defends off the back foot;
23.5;?;Broad to Watson, no run good shape away once again, Watson lets it sail by;
23.4;?;Broad to Watson, no run left alone outside off again;
23.3;?;Broad to Watson, no run no shot offered to a ball that shapes away;
23.2;?;Broad to Watson, no run punched defensively to cover;
23.1;2;Broad to Watson, 2 runs straight ball, Watson simply pushes it to midwicket and they scamper through for two, how they had time to get a double there I don't know;
22.6;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run another big step forward and out to off from Ponting, who blocks it away;
22.5;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run good bounce and carry from Anderson, who moves it away from Ponting and it's left alone;
22.4;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run swings this one away, Ponting lets it go;
22.3;?;Anderson to Ponting, no run angling in to Ponting, that's how you want to bowl to him early, but Ponting lunges forward to defend;
22.2;1;Anderson to Watson, 1 run cut straight down into the turf, they get through for a single;
22.1;?;Anderson to Watson, no run pushed away defensively to cover;
21.6;?;Broad to Ponting, no run howzat? Not out, says Koertzen. There was some definite inswing there and Ponting is struck outside the line;
21.5;?;Broad to Ponting, no run left alone outside off;
21.4;?;Broad to Ponting, no run ah, there's an inside edge from Ponting, who hasn't quite got his eye in yet;
21.3;1;Broad to Watson, 1 run that is a cracking pull for a single, Watson looked to positively murder that ball, but Bopara at deep midwicket makes an outstanding diving save to keep it to one;
21.2;4;Broad to Watson, FOUR runs that's a lovely cut shot, Watson has placed that one nicely just forward of gully and it races away;
21.1;?;Broad to Watson, no run a bit of shape away from Watson, who lets it go;
20.6;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run turns in to a middle-stump line, Watson works it behind square leg again;

20.2;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run worked away behind square for a single;
20.1;?;Swann to Watson, no run oops, Ponting has to put his skates on here to get back at the non-strikers end after Watson clips to midwicket and turns a single down, a good call in the end;
19.6;?;Broad to Ponting, no run outside off and Ponting leaves it alone;
19.5;1;Broad to Watson, 1 run punched away through cover and Ponting is now on strike for the first time;
19.4;?;Broad to Watson, no run nudged back down the pitch;
19.3;?;Broad to Watson, no run oh, Watson drives at this one and it just beats the edge, that wasn't far away;
19.2;?;Broad to Watson, no run left alone outside off;
19.1;?;Broad to Watson, no run pushed away defensively;
18.6;W;Swann to Katich, OUT and Swann strikes in his first over! Around the wicket to Katich, who misses a ball that goes on with the arm, he's struck in line and Aleem Dar says that's lbw.;Simon Katich lbw b Swann 46 (83m 48b 9x4 0x6) SR: 95.83;
18.5;1;Swann to Watson, 1 run sweeps a single this time;
18.4;?;Swann to Watson, no run cuts to point, not much spin yet;
18.3;?;Swann to Watson, no run can't get this one away;
18.2;?;Swann to Watson, no run ooh, that's a close lbw shout. Watson sweeps and is struck in front, Aleem Dar says no. I wonder if there was an inside edge? Must've been a close one;
18.1;?;Swann to Watson, no run pushed away defensively;
17.6;?;Broad to Katich, no run pushed back down the pitch for no run;
17.5;?;Broad to Katich, no run pushed away to cover this time;
17.4;?;Broad to Katich, no run fullish again, Katich drives back down the pitch and Broad fields;
17.3;4;Broad to Katich, FOUR runs another boundary, but this one was a stroke of luck for Katich. He drives and a thick edge sails just wide of Flintoff at second slip, that could so easily have been catchable;
17.2;4;Broad to Katich, FOUR runs and another boundary! Katich plays this one off the back foot and crunches a drive through cover, well placed;
17.1;?;Broad to Katich, no run fullish and swinging in to the pads, Katich clips wide of mid-on but Cook moves swiftly to make the save;
16.6;4;Onions to Watson, FOUR runs and a really strong pull to follow up, Onions overcorrects and pitches too short, Watson is quickly onto a pull that flies through square leg and beats the man in the deep, this outfield is admirably quick;
16.5;4;Onions to Watson, FOUR runs crashing straight drive! Too full from Onions and Watson slammed that into the ground so hard that it sounded like a gunshot, and it was so straight that Aleem Dar had to duck to avoid a blow to the head;
16.4;?;Onions to Watson, no run super delivery! That's pitching on off, moving away a fraction and luring Watson into a prod, it sails past the outside edge;
16.3;1lb;Onions to Katich, 1 leg bye Katich shuffles across, as he likes to do, and works one behind square;
16.2;4;Onions to Katich, FOUR runs on the pads and that's a lovely clip through midwicket from Katich, who has been timing the ball nicely, and it just reaches the boundary;
16.1;?;Onions to Katich, no run nudged away defensively to cover;
15.6;?;Broad to Watson, no run this one swings down leg side, Watson can't get anything on it;
15.5;?;Broad to Watson, no run left alone outside off;
15.4;?;Broad to Watson, no run straighter now, and a driveable length, Watson gets a bit of a thickish edge on that attempted straight drive, it runs away to cover;
15.3;?;Broad to Watson, no run punched away to cover, again the timing isn't there on this shot;
15.2;?;Broad to Watson, no run cut away rather clunkily behind point;
15.1;?;Broad to Watson, no run tries to tempt Watson outside off, shaping away a touch, the batsman lets it go;
14.6;1;Onions to Watson, 1 run a bit straighter this time and Watson works a single to leg;
14.5;?;Onions to Watson, no run driven back down the pitch;
14.4;?;Onions to Watson, no run Onions gets a bit of movement away from Watson, who defends;
14.3;?;Onions to Watson, no run pushed defensively to cover;
14.2;?;Onions to Watson, no run left alone outside off stump;
14.1;?;Onions to Watson, no run went for a ambitious pull, bottom edge into his pads onto the off side;
13.6;?;Broad to Katich, no run good line and this strikes Katich on the pads but it's going way over the top;
13.5;?;Broad to Katich, no run horrible smash outside off, a smash-and-a-miss! Loose stroke;
13.4;?;Broad to Katich, no run swings back into Katich on the off stump. Better line;
13.3;4;Broad to Katich, FOUR runs another one. Identical shot! A leg-stump half-volley dealt with beautifully;
13.2;4;Broad to Katich, FOUR runs worked through the leg-side. And I say worked, because that's all it was, yet it races for four. Katich has found some sublime form here today, and it's notable just how swift the turf is - in spite of all the moisture;
13.1;?;Broad to Katich, no run cuts back into Katich. Good start;
12.6;?;Onions to Watson, no run blocked off the back foot;
12.5;?;Onions to Watson, no run defended on the back foot;
12.4;4;Onions to Watson, FOUR runs four. Only fractionally short and pulled massively for four. This is one good surface, I'm here to tell you!;
12.3;?;Onions to Watson, no run big shout as Watson's trapped on the front foot, pad first, and Onions roars a massive appeal. Outside the line, just, I think. By a whisker!;
12.2;4;Onions to Watson, FOUR runs oh shot, shot Watson! Off-driven beautifully down the ground;
12.1;?;Onions to Watson, no run good start, just outside off and defended;

Onions into the attack
 Innings Start
Incidentally, there are 10,000 tickets available for tomorrow's fifth and final day. ?25 for adults, ?10 for under-16s. An absolute steal. Edgbaston.com is where to go.
Superb knock by Broad. 55 from 64, a really impressive knock which has given England a fine lead of 113. Two hours or so left in the day's play. You can have a look at our live Hawk-Eye feed of all the important stats and graphs and so on, and we'll be back in 10 minutes for Australia's second innings.
93.3;W;Siddle to Broad, OUT got him this time! Gifts Siddle an easy catch, and that's the end of England's innings;Stuart Broad c & b Siddle 55 (92m 64b 9x4 0x6) SR: 85.93;
93.2;1;Siddle to Onions, 1 run cuts back on Onions, the ball gets stuck in the pad then falls out - Broad calls him through for a single and they get it. Sleepy cricket from Australia, really;
93.1;?;Siddle to Onions, no run defended on the back foot;
92.6;4;Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs smash. Broad's taken them apart here. A full toss, absolutely hammered back through Hilfenhaus's hands for four down the ground. He has put some hurt on that ball!;
92.5;4;Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs what a shot. A smashing pull through midwicket, bisecting two in the deep - fantastic way to bring up his fifty, and a very impressive fifty too;
92.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run edged? No. I'm hearing things;
92.3;1;Hilfenhaus to Onions, 1 run nice slice from Onions past the gully;
92.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Onions, no run got him! Five for Hilfenhaus - no! Drops just short of slip. Brilliant ball, angling in to Onions who got a thick outside edge;
92.1;1;Hilfenhaus to Broad, 1 run driven out to deep extra cover and this time he does take a single;
91.6;?;Siddle to Onions, no run sheesh that was close! Left alone and it nearly cut back into his off peg. Super leave, that;
91.5;?;Siddle to Onions, no run cuts and misses once more - great take by Manou, diving forward and snaffling it in the front of his glove;
91.4;?;Siddle to Onions, no run short, wide - Onions tries to cut and can't time it;
91.3;?;Siddle to Onions, no run down the leg side. Good take by Manou who has kept very tidily, bar one or two slips. He looks solid behind the timber, though;
91.2;?;Siddle to Onions, no run plays and misses outside off;
91.1;?;Siddle to Onions, no run defended to point;
90.6;4;Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs Broad flogs it through midwicket and they might get three. They'll get four, in fact, as the fielder palms it over the rope. Very good shot - timed it much better than anyone thought initially;
90.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run bouncer, Broad misses out;
90.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run sliced down to third man;
90.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run clubbed to long-off once more. Lovely clean-striking!;
90.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run elegant drive to long-off. Refusing the single;
90.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run cracked off the back foot square of the wicket. They don't take a single though;
89.6;?;Johnson to Onions, no run ignored outside off;
89.5;?;Johnson to Onions, no run defended on the back foot;
89.4;?;Johnson to Onions, no run beaten outside off;
89.4;1nb;Johnson to Onions, (no ball) no-ball outside off;
89.3;1;Johnson to Broad, 1 run a forcing back-foot drive to long-off;
89.2;?;Johnson to Broad, no run steps a touch to leg, tries to drive - and how on earth has that missed his stumps?! He had all three to aim at, and it went over the top of middle-and-off;
89.1;4;Johnson to Broad, FOUR runs bouncer, Broad attempts to hook it and top-edges it over the keeper for four! Johnson's not going to like that. England's lead approaching the 100 now;
88.6;W;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, OUT got him! Well bowled Hilfenhaus, deserves that. Just outside off, Anderson cuts when he should have left it, and edges it to Manou behind;James Anderson c ?Manou b Hilfenhaus 1 (7m 6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
88.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run attempted yorker but it's a full toss, bashed back to the bowler;
88.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run fuller and he drives and misses;
88.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run nice line outside off, Anderson leaves it alone;
88.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Anderson, no run left alone outside off;
88.1;1;Hilfenhaus to Broad, 1 run a squidge through midwicket;
87.6;1;Johnson to Broad, 1 run a neat flick off his hip;
87.5;4;Johnson to Broad, FOUR runs what a shot. What a stroke from Broad. Johnson's giving him an absolute earful, but this is a serious stroke - off the back-foot, straight down the ground.;
87.4;1;Johnson to Anderson, 1 run off the mark first ball! Nudged off his hip;
87.3;W;Johnson to Swann, OUT got him! Slower ball punched to mid-off. A really soft and tame dismissal but well bowled Johnson;Graeme Swann c North b Johnson 24 (23m 20b 5x4 0x6) SR: 120;
87.2;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs four! Short and chopped brilliantly behind point. That's quite a shot from a tailender. Great balance;
87.2;1nb;Johnson to Swann, (no ball) wayhay! A no-ball bouncer, Swann sways out of the way; Johnson has some heavy words with Swann, who replies with a choice selection himself. Johnson fires back. Now Broad lays in! This is monstrous. The sledging has returned;
87.1;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs four more! This is ridiculous. Swann throws the bat and it flies down to the vacant third man;
86.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run beaten with a beauty that lifted and left Broad's swishing blade. Hilfenhaus is seriously unimpressed and gives Bambi a sweaty glare;
86.5;2;Hilfenhaus to Broad, 2 runs a tuck off his hips in front of square. Hauritz receives a cheer for successfully stopping it this time. Good old drunken banter from a boozed-up Edgbaston;
86.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run left alone outside off;
86.3;4;Hilfenhaus to Broad, FOUR runs flashes and get an edge past the slips for four more! No third man. Oh deary me. Australia are haemorrhaging runs here;
86.2;1;Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 run nice and full but a lovely clip off his toes;
86.1;4;Hilfenhaus to Swann, FOUR runs sliced off the back foot past gully and no third man - that'll be four. Hauritz gives chase from deep point, slides, and takes out a massive chunk of turf which he begrudgingly has to replace. The crowd give him some banter, and he replies in kind - all good-natured fun;
85.6;4;Johnson to Broad, FOUR runs heck of a shot. He had to wait for it, slightly slower, but Broad timed it amazingly well through the leg side. Aerial, but perfectly safe;
85.5;?;Johnson to Broad, no run good line just outside off, and he defends on the back foot;
85.4;?;Johnson to Broad, no run and again. He swings. He misses.;
85.3;?;Johnson to Broad, no run another swing and a miss from Broad! He's completely taken his eye off the ball since tea;
85.2;1;Johnson to Swann, 1 run chopped down and steals a single to cover;
85.1;?;Johnson to Swann, no run goes back to defend;
84.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run nicely punched to mid-off off the back foot;
84.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run and again Broad flashes and misses;
84.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run left alone outside off;
84.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run well bowled, angled across him and Broad flashes and missed;
84.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run nicely driven to mid-off;
84.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Broad, no run defended on the back foot, with quite a diagonal bat, out to mid-off;
83.6;?;Johnson to Swann, no run short of a length and defended on the back foot;
83.5;4;Johnson to Swann, FOUR runs short of a length and punched elegantly off the back foot, just like Dominic Cork would've done;
83.4;2;Johnson to Swann, 2 runs Swann nails this pull! Lovely "crack" of the bat, but it just digs into the outfield and stops almost immediately...;
83.3;1;Johnson to Broad, 1 run gets this shorter ball on target and Broad fends it down to fine leg. Nasty delivery;
83.2;?;Johnson to Broad, no run another horrid stray down the leg side. I hope Manou didn't have anything too stodgy at tea, because he's being given a bit of a workout right now;
83.1;?;Johnson to Broad, no run fires it in wide down the leg side;
82.6;?;Hauritz to Swann, no run prodded away defensively again;
82.5;4;Hauritz to Swann, FOUR runs too short, too wide, and that's an appropriately straightforward crunch through cover for a boundary;
82.4;1;Hauritz to Broad, 1 run tip and run here, nudged to midwicket and they hare through for a quick single, the throw at the stumps ricochets off the bat and so they don't take any overthrows;
82.3;?;Hauritz to Broad, no run pushed to mid-on;
82.2;?;Hauritz to Broad, no run nudged away to gully;
82.1;?;Hauritz to Broad, no run drifts in from around the wicket, defended;

81.5;?;Johnson to Swann, no run driven to cover and can't beat the field;
81.4;?;Johnson to Swann, no run good slower one here, beats the outside edge;
81.3;?;Johnson to Swann, no run bounces him again, Swann ducks this one;
81.3;1w;Johnson to Swann, 1 wide short ball, not surprising with the short leg in place, but it's just a bit too far over the head;
81.2;?;Johnson to Swann, no run bangs it in and it's pushed to point;
81.1;1;Johnson to Broad, 1 run flicked away off the pads for a single;
80.6;?;Hauritz to Swann, no run ouch, driven hard back down the pitch and Hauritz hurls out the right hand and takes a painful blow, very similar to the knock that dislocated his finger earlier in the series;
80.5;?;Hauritz to Swann, no run defended back down the pitch;
80.4;W;Hauritz to Flintoff, OUT well, well. That's a very odd dismissal, it spins out of the rough and Flintoff plays no shot, but doesn't get his gloves out of the way, and the catch is taken at first slip;Andrew Flintoff c Clarke b Hauritz 74 (116m 79b 10x4 1x6) SR: 93.67;
80.3;3;Hauritz to Broad, 3 runs well placed, Broad works against the spin but with the drift, and chips it over wide midwicket;
80.2;1;Hauritz to Flintoff, 1 run cut away through cover for a single;
80.1;?;Hauritz to Flintoff, no run turns in from outside off, Flintoff defends;
79.6;?;Johnson to Broad, no run short outside off, prodded to cover;
79.5;?;Johnson to Broad, no run bangs it in and Broad defends;
79.4;?;Johnson to Broad, no run bouncer, Broad tries to hook and can't get anything on it;
79.3;?;Johnson to Broad, no run wide of off, Broad cuts but can't beat backward point;
79.2;?;Johnson to Broad, no run inside edge onto pad;
79.1;4;Johnson to Broad, FOUR runs that is a glorious shot! The straightest possible boundary, it's driven just a smidgen wide of the stumps at the bowler's end and timed so wonderfully;
78.6;2;Hauritz to Flintoff, 2 runs again it's tossed up outside off, Flintoff cracks it through cover;
78.5;?;Hauritz to Flintoff, no run wide of off, Flintoff doesn't offer a shot;
78.4;1;Hauritz to Broad, 1 run pokes a single to mid-on;
78.3;?;Hauritz to Broad, no run tosses it up outside off, Broad defends;

76.1;?;Hauritz to Flintoff, no run prodded away defensively;
75.6;2;Siddle to Broad, 2 runs oh is that a drop? No, it's just fallen short of Manou. Angled across Broad and a thick edge dips on the keeper, lands a few centimetres in front of his left glove and then runs away to third man;

68.2;2;Watson to Flintoff, 2 runs angled bat down behind gully and the third man sweeps;

64.6;?;Watson to Flintoff, no run wide of the off stump;

61.5;1nb;Johnson to Flintoff, (no ball) leaves this alone outside off, but it's another no-ball;
61.4;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run an ugly slap from Flintoff back past the bowler. No timing whatsoever;
61.3;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run ooh well bowled. Johnson and his blindingly white teeth (what's that all about?) fires in a fine inswinger which Flintoff only just digs out;
61.2;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run solid defensive on the back foot;
61.1;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run a tame bouncer. Flintoff ducks, and has a giggle as Johnson gives him a glare;

59.6;?;Johnson to Prior, no run that's a twit of a shot. A flash outside off;

59.4;?;Johnson to Prior, no run calmly defended to point this time;
59.3;4;Johnson to Prior, FOUR runs marvellous stroke really, but a poor ball. Too full and too straight, Prior flicks it through the leg-side with power and timing, not unlike Atherton might have done it;
59.2;2b;Johnson to Prior, 2 byes the first real stray from Johnson, and the crowd love it. Wings it wide of the leg stump. Manou doesn't have a hope. What a winner;
59.1;1;Johnson to Flintoff, 1 run swings in a touch on the off stump, but Flintoff prods it out to the off side. Johnson's giving him a flurry of verbals and he responds in kind;
58.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run comes forward to defend;

58.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run outswinger and defended solidly;
57.6;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run bouncer, short, and ignored by Flintoff. Johnson flicks his head at Flintoff, a gesture which implies "Well? Anything to say, big man?" and Flintoff smiles back at him. Good stuff, good contest, and the crowd boo Johnson at fine-leg. All fun and games;
57.5;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run on the back foot, defended by Flintoff;
57.4;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run beaten by a brute that lifts off a length! This is the sort of bowling we were promised before the series, but which has evaded him utterly until now. Right now. He's got it swinging and he's getting them to fly through;
57.3;?;Johnson to Flintoff, no run ah, top bowling! Flintoff expects it to swing back, but it holds its line and beats his wafty poke;
57.2;1;Johnson to Prior, 1 run on the off stump, Prior comes forward and drops it out for a single;
57.1;?;Johnson to Prior, no run this one holds its line - shorter, too - and Prior fends it short of gully. Hussey pulls off a fine stop to his left;
57.1;1nb;Johnson to Prior, (no ball) Johnson's booming it now! Monstrous inswing, and late too. He's really got it going now;
56.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, no run chops down late on that! Excellent, full outswinger;
56.5;3;Hilfenhaus to Prior, 3 runs chops down on this and opens the face past point. A squeezy sort of stroke, and an effective one too;
56.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run more banana curve away from Prior who leaves alone;
56.3;4;Hilfenhaus to Prior, FOUR runs ah, top shot. Prior is dangerous through the off side and scores at a serious lick. Thumping cover-drive, on the up;

56.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run wide of the off stump, swinging wider still;
55.6;W;Johnson to Bell, OUT that's out. That's so out. And even Rudi thinks so! Inswinger on middle stump, Bell plays all around it (as he did earlier in the day. And two days ago) and that's out;Ian Bell lbw b Johnson 53 (147m 114b 7x4 1x6) SR: 46.49;
55.5;2;Johnson to Bell, 2 runs short, Bell pulls it hard into the ground but without really timing it. Hauritz gives chase and restricts them to two;
55.4;?;Johnson to Bell, no run 91.4mph outside off, Bell chops down but gully pulls off a superb stop diving to his right. Fine piece of work;
55.3;?;Johnson to Bell, no run the inswinger but it started on leg stump. Good signs for Johnson, though. At least he's moving it for once;
55.2;?;Johnson to Bell, no run just outside off at 90.3mph. Bell's right behind it;
55.1;?;Johnson to Bell, no run touch too short and wide, really;

54.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run driven hard and caught! No! Just short of the diving gully. Another loose stroke by Prior;
54.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run beaten by a beauty! But that's a crud shot from Prior. Swinging away, too short to drive, and he flashes and misses outside off;
54.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run more good lines from Hilfenhaus, this time an inch or two outside off. Solid in defence once more;
54.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Prior, no run good, full delivery with the merest hint of swing away from the batsman, but he climbs into a solid and defensive drive to mid-on;
53.6;?;Johnson to Bell, no run good line on the off stump at 90.5mph and Bell's back and across and defending;

53.4;?;Johnson to Bell, no run bouncer down the leg side;
53.3;?;Johnson to Bell, no run ah - slower ball, good thinking, but poor execution. Miles too wide of Bell;

51.3;4;Johnson to Bell, FOUR runs on his legs and nicely tucked around the corner for four to bring up his 20th Test fifty on his return to the England side. He's had some luck to say the last, but has played well nevertheless. 50 from 96;

49.6;?;Johnson to Bell, no run defended safely back down the pitch;
49.5;?;Johnson to Bell, no run ooh, that's dropped, but only in a technical sense. Bell clips it hard into the shoulder of Katich at short leg, it bounces down towards his hands and clips the fingers on the way to the ground. No real chance to catch that.;

43.3;?;Siddle to Bell, no run a waste from Siddle. Too wide;
43.2;4;Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs oh, fabulous shot from Bell. No great follow-through - his main intention was firstly to get forward securely, head over the ball, then he just punched it through cover. As it happened, it went for four, but it was no more than a defensive push;

42.6;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run crashed into the covers once more;

41.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run sharp, shorter delivery flies down the leg side and possibly off his hip or his backside - absolutely brilliant take by Manou flying to his left! Outstanding snaffle, that really was. Nowhere near the bat, in spite of Australia's massive appeal. The crowd give them what for...;
41.3;4;Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs ooh beautiful shot. An outswinger on off stump and he waited and waited, flicking it through midwicket for four with perfect timing. Dangerous shot, that, but he nailed it on this occasion;
41.2;?;Siddle to Bell, no run just outside off. Good, testing line this by Siddle. Bell's up to the challenge so far, defending solidly on the back foot;
41.1;?;Siddle to Bell, no run ever so slightly wider of the crease, and a very good line to Bell just outside off, swinging away a touch;
40.6;4;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, FOUR runs short of a length and pulled magnificently for four. He didn't really climb into it, but he's in such good form at the moment that it absolutely sped between midwicket and mid-on for four. Super shot;
40.5;1;Hilfenhaus to Bell, 1 run another outswinger but a touch fuller and straighter, allowing Bell onto the front foot. After a bit of hesitation, they take a single;
40.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Bell, no run outswinger to Bell who leaves alone;

40.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run bends back sharply on Strauss who is calm in defence;
39.6;?;Siddle to Bell, no run left alone outside off;
39.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run the first one which swung really late on Bell, who is rapped on the pads, but it's turned down by Rudi. That looks really, really tight, and replays suggest that was probably taking out middle stump about halfway up...Oh. Dear.;
39.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run that's hit him. Siddle's produced a good off-cutter which beats Bell and raps him in the midriff. Very good ball. Bell nods in appreciation;
39.3;?;Siddle to Bell, no run well wide of the off stump, cutting wider still. Bell ignores;
39.2;?;Siddle to Bell, no run good line just outside off. Bell's right behind it;
39.1;4;Siddle to Bell, FOUR runs beautiful shot for four. A defensive push off the back foot behind square, and in spite of all the rain that has chucked itself all over Birmingham, the outfield's quick;

38.5;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run slanted across Strauss;
38.4;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run another inswinger greets Strauss who responds with an identical, and orthodox, off-drive back to the bowler. Though he did get an inside edge;
38.3;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run booming inswinger and nice and full. Strauss drives firmly to Johnson at mid-off;
38.2;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run cracked behind square but straight to point;
38.1;?;Hilfenhaus to Strauss, no run outside edge - drops short of first slip! Strauss only came patting forward, very soft hands. Nicely bowled by Hilfenhaus;
37.6;?;Siddle to Bell, no run better ball, defended on the front foot to gully, but Bell was only made to play twice in that over;
37.5;?;Siddle to Bell, no run Bell steps forward...and watches this sail past him wide of the off stump;
37.4;?;Siddle to Bell, no run defended on the back foot;
37.3;?;Siddle to Bell, no run again too wide, not making Bell play. Safely ignored;

34.2;?;Hauritz to Strauss, no run tosses this one up big time, spins away, and Strauss leaves it;
34.1;?;Hauritz to Strauss, no run prodded away defensively;

2.40pm And play has been abandoned for the day, and what a miserable scene this is for the poor old groundsmen. It's dark, gloomy, cold and chucking it down. And it's the end of our comms, too. So do join us tomorrow morning at 10.30am, when hopefully we'll have better news for you. Until then, t'ra.
The vegetation, in this case, is the grass of the outfield. Much of it is submerged by water. The water table is through the roof, and while there are some "transition zones" between said puddles and aforementioned outfield, those are about as solid as a biscuit that's been dunked in a cup of tea. The situation is soggy and hopeless, I'm afraid, and the sooner they call this off for today - if not the entire Test - the better.
2.35pm Right. It's a bog. A marsh. Here's the dictionary definition of marsh:
n.
An area of soft, wet, low-lying land, characterized by grassy vegetation and often forming a transition zone between water and land.



Perusing what cricket books are coming up for sale. Always interesting to see who's publishing what. Don't forget out reviews section in the Magazine.
2.00pm News! Inspection at 2.30pm. Bye.
1.30pm "It's raining again," reports the Australian Peter English from Edgbaston. "It's coming in through the press-box window." Sigh. "The rain is coming in a bit, more misty. The umpires are just coming out, hands in pockets. Aleem Dar touches the ground, and they don't look like they want to walk out any further." And indeed, the umpires have retreated back inside. It's not looking good, folks.
A history of the mullet in cricket
"This is a mullet," insists Brydon. "Business up top, party at the back."
"It's almost as soft as the first day," says Rudi of the bowlers' run-ups. Another inspection at 1.30pm. Miserable weather, no wind, no sun to help dry it out, and we're some way short of watching any cricket. Intense and massive fail.
12.00pm Right, pitch inspection is currently underway, but the two umpires don't look too enthusiastic and it's drizzling persistently. Meanwhile, doesn't Aleem Dar have a stupendous mullet atop his nugget? It looks like it's made out of wax. Outstanding effort. "I have to pull you up," spits my co-commentator, Brydon. "Aleem's isn't a mullet, because it's not long at the back." Tackling the big issues of the day, we are.
The Aussie commentators are interviewing Steve Rouse now and he says that if it doesn't rain between now and 1pm, they'd look to start play at 1.40pm. Anyway. If anything changes, you have my word: we'll keep you informed.
11.00am No chance of any play before lunch, we reckon. It's seriously moist and damp out there. There'll be another pitch inspection at midday, and we'll keep you up to speed then.
10.45am The umpires are out in the middle and having a look. It's dark and not ideal conditions, though it's not actually raining. More of a drizzle, and it doesn't really know whether to stop or whether to give it absolutely everything. Frustrating to say the least. Have a read of this review of The Duckworth Lewis Method's album.
"Maybe I'll get down there and torment the Shemanator," taunts Shane Warne after hearing England are playing a lot of poker at the moment. He just can't leave it, can he? And that's why we love him. Poor old Bell. Talking of poker, have a read of Andrew Miller's interview with Warne on such things.
10.25am Morning all. Will here for the third day and the first news is that the covers are on, under heavy leaden skies, and we're almost certainly in for a delay. Average, I know, but we'll keep you amused nevertheless. It doesn't look terminal. In the meantime, have a look at our Facebook group and leave your comments on some of the pieces.



6.25pm - stumps So, that's it for the second day's play - an enthralling day it was. Don't forget to check out the video highlights (plenty to watch tonight) along with the bulletin if you've missed any of the play. And most importantly of all, most prosaically, do not hesitate to join us both tomorrow morning at 10.30am. It would be nothing less than a crime not to. Until then, it's goodnight.
6.10pm The umpires, who were hanging around on the pitch, have now left for the dressing room which doesn't suggest we will see a resumption.
5.55pm The covers are coming on now, there are a few spots of rain. And the forecast is for rain tonight and tomorrow morning, clearing tomorrow afternoon.
5.45pm The umpires have offered the light to England, and the batsmen have decided to go off. Strauss raises the bat as he walks off, he has played a really solid innings, giving England a strong platform at 116 for 2. It's not officially stumps, by the way. Stand by for further information.
 Innings Start
That's it from Edgbaston, where the draw leaves England with their 1-0 lead heading to Leeds for the fourth Test beginning on Friday. For now from myself Brydon Coverdale, and Will Luke, it's goodbye.
Here's the presentations. Andrew Strauss: "We're pretty disappointed. We came to the ground this morning with pretty high hopes. All credit to Marcus North and Michael Clarke, they batted exceptionally well." Strauss is optimistic that Flintoff will be fit for Friday's third Test at Headingley.
Ricky Ponting: "The North and Clarke partnership today was something pretty special. It was good for us to get through the way we have."
The Man of the Match is Michael Clarke, for his unbeaten match-saving century. Well played that man. "The wicket played much better than I expected it to today. There was a bit of spin but it was consistent spin."
Clarke raises his bat and takes the applause, and the captains have agreed that is the end of the game. What a super innings from Michael Clarke, he and Marcus North came together with Australia far from safe in this match and they killed off England's hopes of victory. The rain, of course, was the deciding factor earlier in the match. Handshakes all round.

105.5;?;Broad to Clarke, no run left alone outside off;
105.4;?;Broad to Clarke, no run bowled him! Has he? No. I could've sworn I heard a wooden noise. The bails are still intact! Excellent off-cutter into Clarke who was beaten all ends up. And replays show that clattered the off stump!;

105.1;2;Broad to Clarke, 2 runs swivels onto a pull;

102.6;4;Bopara to Clarke, FOUR runs flicked to leg and timed wonderfully. Can't believe he's got four for that! Nothing more than a prod off his pads;

102.3;4;Bopara to North, FOUR runs North's racing to a hundred here! Fantastic drive through extra cover for four more;
102.2;4;Bopara to North, FOUR runs jeepers - outstanding shot. Really is a high-class shot off the back foot through long-on. Certainly my shot of the day, and a contender for shot of the Test. This bloke can bat;

101.1;?;Broad to Clarke, no run worked to mid-on;
100.6;4;Swann to North, FOUR runs a really ugly smite through midwicket. And he'll get four! Didn't think he timed it all that well - it was a cross-batted flog, as though he was holding a scythe and attempting to cut through some tall reeds.;

99.5;1;Broad to Clarke, 1 run bouncer and he paddles it around the corner;
99.4;3;Broad to North, 3 runs driven inside out and in the air, just to Flintoff's right at mid-off. And the poor bloke has 20 or so yards to run to haul it in;

98.2;?;Swann to North, no run guided out to Anderson at point who makes a good diving stop;

87.5;?;Anderson to North, no run tries to work this one through leg but it lobs away off the pad;
87.4;?;Anderson to North, no run there's a half-chance - no, more like a one-tenth chance - for Anderson as North drives hard straight back at him, but the bowler can't get down and it crashes into his ankle on the full;
87.3;?;Anderson to North, no run pushed across North again, he leaves it;
87.2;?;Anderson to North, no run no shot offered again;
87.1;?;Anderson to North, no run left alone;
86.6;4;Onions to Clarke, FOUR runs nice drive there from Clarke, but he's helped by the lack of agility of the mid-on Flintoff, who dives ungracefully, misses the ball, and then battles to get back up.;

84.5;?;Onions to North, no run left alone outside off;
84.4;?;Onions to North, no run fullish length, North grunts as he tries to muscle this drive through the field but only finds mid-off;
84.3;?;Onions to North, no run pushed away to cover defensively;

82.5;4;Onions to North, FOUR runs lovely stroke, a fullish ball and North drives it comprehensively through cover and the timing is such that it flies across the turf at pace;

79.4;?;Anderson to North, no run left alone outside off;
79.3;?;Anderson to North, no run prodded back down the pitch;
79.2;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run quick single pushed to midwicket and they had to scamper to make that one, in fact had Bopara been a toucher cleaner with his pickup Clarke might have been in trouble - had Bopara hit the stumps, which he didn't;
79.1;2;Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs Clarke cuts this one backward of point, the sub fielder does well to slide and save a boundary;
78.6;?;Swann to North, no run punched back down the pitch;
78.5;1;Swann to Clarke, 1 run on the pads and it's turned behind square;

76.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run fullish ball, jams it down the pitch to Swann;
76.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run defended away safely;
76.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run now then, what's happened here? There's an appeal for caught behind, a ball has struck Clarke on the toe and bobbed up to the diving Prior. England are confident, Koertzen says no, but then radios to the third umpire. I don't know what Rudi was asking, but the ball did miss the outside edge in any case, and the right decision is made;
76.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run tossed up to Clarke, who uses his feet and defends;
76.2;1;Swann to North, 1 run plays off the back foot and drives it away behind point;
76.1;?;Swann to North, no run clunks this one down into the turf and Prior collects;

75.2;?;Bopara to North, no run quicker ball at 83mph, defended;
75.1;4;Bopara to North, FOUR runs back cut for four! Lovely late cut, played with soft hands. One of my favourite shots;
74.6;4;Swann to Clarke, FOUR runs what a sweep that is! Absolutely nailed it through midwicket for four;
74.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run defends on the back foot;
74.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run ooh that could've been tricky. Again comes down, doesn't quite get to the pitch of the ball, and it spins back onto his pad;
74.3;?;Swann to Clarke, no run again skips down the pitch, as he always does, and blocks;
74.2;?;Swann to Clarke, no run tossed up and he smothers it;

73.3;?;Bopara to Clarke, no run pushed out to the off side;
73.2;?;Bopara to Clarke, no run a slappy pull on the front foot and Strauss has dropped him at short midwicket! Never looked like catching it. Oh double dear;

72.6;?;Swann to North, no run blocked on the back foot;

72.3;?;Swann to North, no run nudged to leg;
72.2;?;Swann to North, no run straighter on middle stump, and it's blocked comfortably;
72.1;?;Swann to North, no run flighted and defended;
71.6;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run cuts back sharply and that's a good leave! Not too far away from losing his off peg, there;
71.5;1;Flintoff to North, 1 run dropped out to the off side - cover does well, I think it was Bopara, and winged in a throw as the pair took off for a run, but Clarke was well home;
71.4;?;Flintoff to North, no run sweetly struck, squeezing it out to the off side - excellent stop at cover;
71.3;?;Flintoff to North, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;
71.2;?;Flintoff to North, no run left alone outside off;
71.1;?;Flintoff to North, no run driven out to the off side;

70.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run comes forward to defend;
70.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run pads up and a huge shout from Swann and Prior, but he's hit well outside the line and it's a guessing game really from Rudi who, rightly, guesses it's not out;

70.2;1;Swann to North, 1 run a Swanny full-toss is stoked to mid-off;

68.4;?;Swann to North, no run good length, North blocks;
68.3;?;Swann to North, no run tossed up nicely, but North reaches forward to smother like a murderer with a pillow;

68.1;?;Swann to North, no run defended on the front foot;
67.6;1;Flintoff to North, 1 run flicked around the corner and Flintoff's down - he twisted his left ankle nastily there. Oh dear lord. He can barely move. He looks about as athletic as me on a Monday morning;
67.5;?;Flintoff to North, no run "ohhhhhhhh" is the cry from Prior as North comfortably shoulders arms;
67.4;?;Flintoff to North, no run goes back to defend. And defends.;

66.6;?;Swann to Clarke, no run down the pitch once more, padding it away;
66.5;?;Swann to Clarke, no run again, takes a big stride and defends;
66.4;?;Swann to Clarke, no run Clarke jumps down the pitch like a whippet who's burnt his backside. So quick on his feet;
66.3;1;Swann to North, 1 run drags this one short, though, and North urgently nurdles him to leg;
66.2;?;Swann to North, no run gives this a little bit more flight on middle. I like Swann's tactics at the moment. Very controlled bowling;
66.1;?;Swann to North, no run tossed up just wide of North, sharp turn - left alone;
65.6;4;Flintoff to Clarke, FOUR runs outside edge, angled down past gully. Played with soft hands;
65.5;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run patted out to the off side;
65.4;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run attacks the stumps and forces Clarke to defend. And he does so nicely;
65.3;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run Clarke's not touching those. No way. Rabid wide deliveries are not for touching;
65.2;?;Flintoff to Clarke, no run again a little too wide, and left alone;

63.6;4;Onions to North, FOUR runs angled down to the third man boundary;
63.5;1;Onions to Clarke, 1 run short of a length but Clarke's so quick on his feet, on what is now a slow pitch. Pulled around;
63.4;?;Onions to Clarke, no run driven to extra cover;

62.5;?;Broad to North, no run angled across the patient, compact figure of North who ignores it utterly;
62.4;?;Broad to North, no run leaves it alone outside off;
62.3;1;Broad to Clarke, 1 run patted around the corner. This pitch is slowing down by the over...he had so much time there;
62.2;?;Broad to Clarke, no run bouncer - sharp in pace - but too short and comfortably ducked;
62.1;1;Broad to North, 1 run crunched to a tired looking James Anderson at mid-off who dives and takes out a chunk of turf;
61.6;?;Onions to Clarke, no run yowzers - that was close. Good leave in the end, but that cut back more than Clarke thought;
61.5;2;Onions to Clarke, 2 runs deserved four, that. Short-arm pull off one leg, ala many of the Caribbean in the 1970s-80s, played in complete control. Cook's dive saves four;
61.4;?;Onions to Clarke, no run shorter delivery and Clarke rides the bounce, playing it almost in front of his face;
61.3;1;Onions to North, 1 run fuller and quicker, on middle stump, swinging back into North but he pinches a single to midwicket;
61.2;?;Onions to North, no run good line just outside off. North, whose face is almost entirely static and emotionless when he's at the crease, leaves it well alone;
61.1;?;Onions to North, no run solid off-drive to mid-off;
60.6;?;Broad to Clarke, no run too wide and left alone;
60.5;4;Broad to Clarke, FOUR runs fantastic shot! He is in sublime form this bloke. On-driven straight down the ground for four;
60.4;?;Broad to Clarke, no run late swing back into the right-hander who nudges to leg;
60.3;?;Broad to Clarke, no run again too short and a bit too wide to trouble Clarke who shoulders arms with champion intent;
60.2;1;Broad to North, 1 run short of a length and he goes back to defend with a straight bat. Cheeky single;
60.1;?;Broad to North, no run angled across the left-handed North who ignores it. Too short from Broad;
59.6;?;Onions to Clarke, no run left alone outside off;
59.5;?;Onions to Clarke, no run ducks beneath a bouncer;
59.4;?;Onions to Clarke, no run better length. "Wait on" is the call from Clarke. Or rather "whydon" in his 'stralian twang;
59.3;4;Onions to Clarke, FOUR runs and again! This time it's fuller and driven straighter, right down the ground;
59.2;4;Onions to Clarke, FOUR runs oh that's a disgracefully brilliant cover-drive. That's the sort of stroke which'll make all the other cover-drives feel rubbish about themselves. Glorious from Clarke;
59.1;2;Onions to Clarke, 2 runs that swings in late on Clarke who himself is a little late in flicking it to leg. Touch of movement back into the right-hander;
58.6;?;Broad to North, no run now that one spat up nastily on his glove;

58.4;1;Broad to Clarke, 1 run that's well played, coming forward and opening the face to Bopara at backward point;
58.3;?;Broad to Clarke, no run touch too wide. Clarke leaves alone on length;
58.2;?;Broad to Clarke, no run "wait on," is the demand from Clarke to North as he pats this off the back foot;
58.1;?;Broad to Clarke, no run now then - that swung. And late, too. Comfortably played and, yes, off the middle of the bat, but that's encouraging for the beanpole Broad;
57.6;?;Onions to North, no run very good line on middle stump but North defends;
57.5;?;Onions to North, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;
57.4;?;Onions to North, no run good line on the off stump. North right behind it;
57.3;?;Onions to North, no run touch too short and wide of the off stump to trouble North, who lets it go to the east;
57.2;?;Onions to North, no run wide of the off stump and left alone;
57.1;?;Onions to North, no run full and straight, but swinging down the leg side! Excellent start by Onions. Half a shout but comfortably going down leg. At least it swung. We ain't had much swingage today;
56.6;?;Broad to Clarke, no run angled in to the body, Clarke watchfully defends;
56.5;?;Broad to Clarke, no run ooh, Clarke is on the move a little, shuffling forward and a thickish edge runs towards gully;
56.4;?;Broad to Clarke, no run pushed to cover once again;
56.3;?;Broad to Clarke, no run straight-bat defence from Clarke now, no swing there;
56.2;?;Broad to Clarke, no run prodded away to cover;
56.1;?;Broad to Clarke, no run curves away a touch and Clarke leaves it;
55.6;?;Anderson to North, no run lets it go through to Prior once again;
55.5;?;Anderson to North, no run oh, that wasn't far away from the off stump at all, North lets it go and in the end he's judged it well;
55.4;?;Anderson to North, no run lets this one go, again it's angled across him;
55.3;?;Anderson to North, no run fullish length now, North clunks down on this one;
55.2;?;Anderson to North, no run angled well across the batsman and there's no need to play;
55.1;1;Anderson to Clarke, 1 run angled in towards Clarke, who nudges to mid-on and gets through for a single;
54.6;?;Broad to North, no run no shot outside off again;
54.5;4;Broad to North, FOUR runs what a shot to get off the mark, North laces this one through cover and it races to the boundary, that really was a wonderful stroke;
54.4;?;Broad to North, no run 85mph or 138kph, bangs it in short of a length and it curves in, but North can leave it safely;
54.3;?;Broad to North, no run no shot offered once again, Broad hangs it outside off;
54.2;?;Broad to North, no run angling in but outside off and North leaves it;
54.1;?;Broad to North, no run first ball for North this innings and he gets forward to defend;
53.6;4;Anderson to Clarke, FOUR runs good shot, well played indeed by Clarke as he picks the gap wide of extra cover with a well-timed drive that races away to the boundary;
53.5;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run defended away safely to the off side;
53.4;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run good line, or as the players would say, in the right areas, as Anderson tries to entice a prod just a fraction outside off but Clarke leaves it;
53.3;2;Anderson to Clarke, 2 runs strays onto the pads and it's comfortably clipped away behind square;
53.2;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run left alone outside off this time, good line though, not far away from off stump;
53.1;?;Anderson to Clarke, no run bangs it in short of a length, this one doesn't get up much and Clarke adjusts enough to defend;
52.6;W;Broad to Hussey, OUT massive wicket! Broad does the job and gets a thin outside edge from Hussey, he's just probing outside off and Hussey pushes and manages to find contact with a ball that didn't seam a lot;Michael Hussey c ?Prior b Broad 64 (154m 130b 13x4 0x6) SR: 49.23;
52.5;?;Broad to Hussey, no run driven to cover, where Collingwood misfield, but it's not enough to allow a run;
52.4;?;Broad to Hussey, no run he's around the wicket to Hussey, who leaves it outside off;
52.3;?;Broad to Hussey, no run defended solidly again, no real threat yet from Broad;
