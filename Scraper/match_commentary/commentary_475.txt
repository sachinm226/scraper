Pakistan have much to thank Afridi for, as his late surge took them to a target that should test the Australians. Still, it's a good pitch to bat on but also has its share of advantages for seamers which Aamer, Asif and Naved will look to exploit early in the innings to put some pressure on Australia. Join us in a little over half-an-hour for the chase.

 Innings Start
Hussey pumps his fist as he runs across. Another not out for him. Australia go up 1-0 with a clinical run chase. Superb effort from White. Should be the Man of the Match, I'd say. Afridi's big hitting late in the Pakistan innings helped the tourists set Australia a target of 275 but they won with five wickets and nine deliveries in hand. White paced his innings beautifully, all Hussey had to do was knock the ball around and not lose his wicket. The fans lap up this win. Australia keep rolling.
That's all we have for you. Do join us for the second game which is on Sunday. Thanks for your company and we look forward to bringing you the coverage for the Sydney game. Bye for now!
