Data
9:12pm Alright, we're ready for the chase. It's Finch and Short coming out to open. Wade is slated to bat No. 3. Chahar with the ball.
WATCH: Henriques gets KL Rahul, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya (India subcontinent only)
That's a big finish for India, but we await to see how bad Jadeja's injury - which appears to be a hamstring - is and whether he can bowl. India's badly lost momentum in the middle of that innings against excellent spells by Zampa and Henriques. Starc and Hazlewood didn't quite get it right in the last couple of overs and Jadeja found his range. It has given India something to bowl at - last year Australia comfortably chased 151 to beat Pakistan - but they might be bowler down. Varun will be back with your shortly for the start of the chase
WATCH: Hardik Pandya holes out to Steven Smith at long-off (India subcontinent only)
Elsewhere, East Bengal - coached by Robbie Fowler, formerly of Brisbane Roar - are off to a poor start in their maiden season in the ISL. Can they turn their fortunes around? Read more here.
19.6;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run gets the yorker in to finish, inside edge into the boot and they manage the single;
19.5;4;Starc to Jadeja, FOUR runs goes short, and gets hammered! What a finish by Jadeja. Starc dragged it down, not sure if on purpose, Jadeja latched on and pulls it through the leg side;
19.4;4;Starc to Jadeja, FOUR runs wide of long-on! A fiercely struck lofted punch straight down the ground...Abbott almost made the ground across, but was out of reach;
19.3;W;Starc to Sundar, OUT straight to long-on...couldn't get the distance on it and a comfortable catch;Washington Sundar c Abbott b Starc 7 (5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 140;
19.2;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run dropped! Henriques at backward point...short of a length, Jadeja gets a top edge into his helmet and it loops towards backward point. Think Henriques misjudged it slightly;
19.1;1;Starc to Sundar, 1 run gets the yorker in, dug out into the leg side and Jadeja can barely move;
18.6;4;Hazlewood to Jadeja, FOUR runs full, wide outside off, crunched through the off side! All along the ground, this pinged off the middle and into the gap;
18.5;4;Hazlewood to Jadeja, FOUR runs drags the length back, he pulls and gets it just over square leg...he's in pain, but doing some damage here;
18.4;6;Hazlewood to Jadeja, SIX runs that's MASSIVE! Full outside off, Jadeja picks it up and swings it miles back over deep square leg. Almost onto the root of the stand;
18.3;2;Hazlewood to Jadeja, 2 runs back of a length outside off, one hand comes off the bat as he swings to the leg side and it comes off a top edge...lack of timing allows a second;
18.3;3nb;Hazlewood to Jadeja, (no ball) 2 runs goes down on his back knee and slog sweeps over midwicket, superb work on the boundary as Smith gets across from long-on and keeps it in play...but it's a no-ball!;
18.2;?;Hazlewood to Jadeja, no run similar stroke, but the ball was a touch wider and he had to reach of it...picks out cover on the ring;
18.1;4;Hazlewood to Jadeja, FOUR runs great shot! Full, wide outside off, allows Jadeja to free his arms into a flowing, powerful cover drive which bisects mid-off and cover who are both inside the ring;
17.6;?;Starc to Sundar, no run a wide yorker outside off, Sundar plays over the top of it;
17.5;2;Starc to Sundar, 2 runs gets this one on target, a yorker at off stump, drilled straight down the ground;
17.4;4;Starc to Sundar, FOUR runs inside edge past leg stump...again this didn't pitch, it's 148kph, Sundar swings to the leg side and gets an edge between his legs;
17.3;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run full toss at the stumps, whipped to deep midwicket;
17.2;2;Starc to Jadeja, 2 runs worked down the ground towards long-on;

17.1;1;Starc to Jadeja, 1 run big full toss which is mistimed into the leg side;
16.6;1;Henriques to Jadeja, 1 run short outside off, square drives to deep point;
16.5;W;Henriques to Hardik, OUT high...very high, and taken at long-off! Pandya is cut off before he can really get going, gets all height on this one, low down on the bat, Smith has plenty of time to get underneath it;Hardik Pandya c Smith b Henriques 16 (15b 0x4 1x6) SR: 106.66;
16.4;2;Henriques to Hardik, 2 runs Abbott saves a six with a palm back! Almost a fantastic catch, but he couldn't flick it back up as we see so often now. Pandya launched it towards long-on, not quite with the distance needed. Abbott leaped on the rope and did very well;
16.3;1;Henriques to Jadeja, 1 run short outside off, driven wide of cover but the sweeper keeps them to a single;
16.2;1;Henriques to Hardik, 1 run short outside off, crunched powerful towards cover where Finch does well to intercept;
16.1;6;Henriques to Hardik, SIX runs into the stands! Pandya had changed his bat before that ball and this one is working nicely. Full outside off, he's able to get underneath and swings high and mighty over long-on;
15.6;2;Hazlewood to Jadeja, 2 runs back of a length, opens the face and dabs towards short third man...bit of a fumble from Zampa and they are alert to the chance of the second;
15.5;1;Hazlewood to Hardik, 1 run drives a delivery off the stumps to long-on;
15.4;1;Hazlewood to Jadeja, 1 run gives himself room outside leg, drives a good length delivery straight to mid-off but the throw misses...he was gone with a direct hit by Abbott;

14.6;?;Zampa to Jadeja, no run full outside off, drives to cover and he finishes with a dot ball;

14.4;1;Zampa to Jadeja, 1 run comes down the pitch and drives strongly to long-off but only a single which won't hurt Australia;
14.3;?;Zampa to Jadeja, no run worked off the pads but straight to short fine leg;
14.2;1;Zampa to Hardik, 1 run starts to move outside leg but then comes back into line and drives to long-off;
14.1;1;Zampa to Jadeja, 1 run comes forward and drives wide of cover;
13.6;1;Henriques to Jadeja, 1 run short of a length at middle and leg, shoved into the leg side;
13.5;W;Henriques to Rahul, OUT terrific catch at long-on! Rahul has lost the strike and now lost his wicket. The pressure has told in these middle overs, Rahul trying to break the shackles but can't get the distance down the ground. Abbott runs in and takes the catch diving forward;KL Rahul c Abbott b Henriques 51 (40b 5x4 1x6) SR: 127.5;
13.4;1lb;Henriques to Hardik, 1 leg bye short of a length, gets himself into a tangle here as he looks to pull, hammers into Pandya's hip and loops away. That will be painful;
13.3;?;Henriques to Hardik, no run goes across the crease and takes this from outside off but straight to midwicket...three dots in a row;
13.2;?;Henriques to Hardik, no run follows it up with a yorker, 124kph, which is jabbed down the pitch...this has been exceptional from Henriques;
13.1;?;Henriques to Hardik, no run short of a length outside off, goes back and across then defends on his toes;
12.6;?;Zampa to Rahul, no run good length, at middle, played into the on side and that's an over with a wicket and just two runs;
12.5;1;Zampa to Hardik, 1 run drives a low full toss down to long-on;
12.4;W;Zampa to Pandey, OUT good catch at short third man! Hazlewood does well to get down to that. Pandey went back to a slightly shorter ball, goes for the cut, it takes the top edge and is dipping as it reaches Hazlewood;Manish Pandey c Hazlewood b Zampa 2 (8b 0x4 0x6) SR: 25;
12.3;?;Zampa to Pandey, no run tucked into midwicket and it's another dot ball;

12.1;1;Zampa to Rahul, 1 run tapped into the off side;
11.6;?;Henriques to Pandey, no run back on a full length outside off, 117, and it's bunted back to him...well bowled by Henriques;
11.6;1w;Henriques to Pandey, 1 wide loses his line down the leg side so a bonus ball for India;

11.4;?;Henriques to Pandey, no run full outside off, touch slower at 117kph, played into the covers;
11.3;?;Henriques to Pandey, no run a yorker at off stump, 126kph, well bowled and all he can do is dig it out;
11.2;?;Henriques to Pandey, no run full at off stump, pushed into the covers;
11.1;W;Henriques to Samson, OUT straight to cover! Full outside off, was in the slot for the drive, but Samson couldn't have picked out the fielder on the edge of the ring with any more precision;Sanju Samson c Swepson b Henriques 23 (15b 1x4 1x6) SR: 153.33;
10.6;1;Abbott to Samson, 1 run a flick of the wrists into midwicket. Good over for India;
10.5;2;Abbott to Samson, 2 runs angled into leg stump again, nudged towards deep square and they race back for a second...Samson has to get the dive out;

10.4;1;Abbott to Rahul, 1 run full at the toes, clipped to deep square leg and takes him to a 37-ball half-century;
10.3;1;Abbott to Samson, 1 run angled into the pads, tucked into midwicket;
10.2;4;Abbott to Samson, FOUR runs power over the off side! Short of a length outside off, Samson jumps into a lofted square cover drive and sends it wide of the sweeper;
10.1;1;Abbott to Rahul, 1 run full at off stump, driven sweetly to mid-off;
9.6;1;Henriques to Rahul, 1 run full and wide outside off, leans in and drives to sweeper cover;

8.6;1;Swepson to Rahul, 1 run short of a length at middle, onto the back foot to punch to long-on;

8.4;?;Swepson to Rahul, no run googly, short and low and down leg side. Slides into his pads as he looks for the whip through midwicket;

8.2;?;Swepson to Samson, no run good length at off stump, defended off the back foot;
8.1;6;Swepson to Samson, SIX runs pumped over deep midwicket! Bona fide six hitter. Don't bowl short to this guy as a spinner. It's sitting up nicely at an off stump line and he's back for the big pull;

6.5;1;Swepson to Samson, 1 run short and turning away outside off, chopped to sweeper cover off the back foot;
6.4;W;Swepson to Kohli, OUT balloons back to the bowler. The only thing going for Swepson this ball is that it has gripped. It's short but it's gripped and turned away and gotten big on Kohli in the corridor. He's shaping to pull but checks himself and it pops back gently to the bowler off the leading edge;Virat Kohli c & b Swepson 9 (9b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100;
6.3;1;Swepson to Rahul, 1 run short and turning away, wide outside off. Pulled along the ground to long-on;

5.6;?;Abbott to Rahul, no run yorker at off stump, jams it out, towards mid-off;
5.5;?;Abbott to Rahul, no run high full toss at middle stump, patted hurriedly into the leg side;
5.4;6;Abbott to Rahul, SIX runs slaughtered! Whew. He has picked the length so quickly on this. It's short of a length. He's got a front foot press but quickly springs back up as the ball rises and then nails the pull on the up. Sweet, sweet sound;
5.3;4;Abbott to Rahul, FOUR runs leading edge floats over short third and point. Good length delivery slanted into middle stump. Wants to bring out his pick-up shot behind square on the leg side. Closes the face too early;
5.2;1;Abbott to Kohli, 1 run short of a length on middle stump, jumps out and opens up the off side. Can only pat it towards sweeper cover;

3.3;?;Hazlewood to Kohli, no run squares him. Good length, off stump, swung away from the outside edge. Kohli had to try and adjust his angled bat, but that was quickly past him;
3.2;1;Hazlewood to Rahul, 1 run good length outside off, opens the face to steer towards third man. Smith at backward point can't gather cleanly to his left and Kohli calls Rahul through;

2.5;W;Starc to S Dhawan, OUT knocks out off stump with a trademark delivery! He's back. Starc is back. High 140s, outswinger starting middle and curving viciously towards off. Dhawan's got his front leg in the leg side and his stumps exposed as he creates room for the drive through cover. The late swing and the pace does him and it's a pretty sight as the stumps is tonked;Shikhar Dhawan b Starc 1 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 16.66;
2.4;1;Starc to Rahul, 1 run yorker length just outside off, jabbed into the point region;

0.1;?;Starc to Rahul, no run a swish and miss. Full and wide floater outside off. Rahul reaches out for the drive, expecting that to swing back in. It's gone straight on;

7:10pm Thanks Gnasher! Hello all, been a while. Mitch Starc has the ball with a slip in place for Rahul. He's over the wicket.
7.05pm Hyder: "I kinda miss Jhye Richardson in the Aussie side. He is a fantastic bowler and great talent. Why is he not in the squad?" Still on his comeback from shoulder reconstruction. On track for the BBL with Perth Scorchers.
Right, it seems Pandey IS playing. On that note, I'll hand over to Varun
7.00pm Rumple: "Very good and bold decision to drop chahal and kuldeep..both are out of form from long time..Its time to look at other options..Even Ashwin should be looked as option in white ball cricket"
Malli: "I don't think it's the right decision to have two bowlers (Jaddu, Sundar) who are more defensive over wicket-taking bowlers (Kul, cha). It's better to have 1 from each set and use Chahar for batting if needed later"
For those interested, this was Mitch Swepson's previous international outing
The Australia players are now taking the field for the Barefoot Circle Ceremony and Welcome to Country
6.50pm Arjav: "No Kuldeep, No Chahal...Yet another questionable omission...."
Hardik Pandya is certainly a man in-form and was India's highest run-getter in the ODIs. If you are in the Indian subcontinent, you can watch highlights from his 92 in the third ODI here.
Okay, there appears to be a bit of confusion over the India team...just looking into it. The official team sheet has Manish Pandey in the XI, but elsewhere it's Iyer.
Silva: "According to BCCI twitter, Shreyas iyer is playing not pandey" Yep, we are checking. TV graphic also had Pandey a moment ago
6.40pm Australia won the toss and will bowl
They have brought Mitchell Swepson into the squad for Ashton Agar who has been ruled out of the series. No place for Alex Carey so it's Matthew Wade with the gloves. Swepson has been inside the Australia 'bubble' training with the A squad in Sydney.
Australia 1 Aaron Finch, 2 D'Arcy Short, 3 Matthew Wade, 4 Steven Smith, 5 Glenn Maxwell, 6 Moises Henriques, 7 Sean Abbott, 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Mitchell Swepson, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood
So it looks like India have rested Jasprit Bumrah, and it's Rahul to open with Dhawan
India 1 KL Rahul (wk), 2 Shikhar Dhawan, 3 Virat Kohli (capt), 4 Manish Pandey, 5 Sanju Samson, 6 Hardik Pandya, 7 Ravindra Jadeja, 8 Washington Sundar, 9 Deepak Chahar, 10 Mohammed Shami, 11 T Natarajan
6.30pm Akhilesh: "One of the less talked points about this series is Dhawan vs Rahul. India will most probably make them both open in all 3 matches( unless Rahul is rested for the Test Series). After a fantastic IPL for both of them, this should be a direct face-off to decide who's gonna open with Rohit in the future." Yes, will be interesting to see if any of the Test players in this squad are pulled out for the warm-up match against Australia A instead of the last two T20s.
BCCI have just tweeted that T Natarajan will make his T20I debut


Sanket: "The recent form of Pandya is blessing for team India, they need to a bit of reinvent how they go in middle over in T20's. For this sometimes they can afford to use hardik as a floater and let the guys around him play accordingly. In the form of Rohit, Dhawan, Rahul , shreyas India lacks someone with brutal power hitting abilities so they can give hardik a go."
6.20pm We'll need to wait and see if Hazlewood makes the side tonight, but he came back into the T20I set-up for the first time in more than four years for the final match of the England series and has certainly had the wood over Virat Kohli in the ODIs.
Tom Moody explains how Hazlewood did it (Indian subcontinent only)
Neel : "Any update on Stoinis's injury?" Nothing official, but side injuries are tricky to come back from quickly
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mitch Starc (@mstarc56)
6.15pm Australia can go back to the top of the T20I rankings with a victory in this series after slipping from that spot in their 2-1 defeat to England to September. They were building very nice towards the home T20 World Cup which, of course, was postponed from this year.
Anand: "I would love to see Sanju get a game thereby making Kohli open alongside Rahul. Since Bumrah needs rest ahead of test series I would go with the batting order this way Pandya, Jadeja, Chahar, Sundar, Natarajan and Chahal"
It was tough work for most of the bowlers in the one-dayers, although Adam Zampa and Josh Hazlewood were both excellent and Shardul Thakur had an impact in the final game, and in this piece Aakash Chopra looks at how the India bowlers need to adjust
6.05pm While you are settling in, why not catch up with the highlights of India's victory in the final ODI (Indian subcontinent only). Could that give the tour some momentum?
6.00pm Hello and welcome to our coverage of the first T20I between Australia and India in Canberra. The one-dayers were high-scoring and you get the sense these matches will be as well. It's all over in a rush, too, with three games over the next five days before thoughts turn to the Tests. I'm Andrew McGlashan and along with Varun Shetty will bring you all the action over the next few hours.
To get started, here's a preview to this game which could see Australia needing to juggle things with a few injuries in their camp while Pat Cummins is being rested.
The Australians are going to be wearing a great kit for this series


 Innings Start
India win by 11 runs on the back of a very strong finish to their innings and an excellent performance in the field. Australia had a good start to the chase but struggled badly after Finch departed. Decent story out of the match with Chahal, who came in as a concussion sub for Jadeja, playing a key role with the ball (after Jadeja had done with the bat).
If you're in Indian subcontinent, here are some match highlights you can catch up with:

Sugumar: "That catch by Samson changed everything tonight. Way to go young indians!!!!"
Mukunth: "So, Australia got a fair bit of an idea on the X-factor player rule before the BBL" Ha, almost
Deepak Sahu: "India's new allrounder Jadechal won us the game.. what an all-round performance"
Man of the Match is Chahal! "A great feeling, no pressure for me when we were batting then I got to know I was going to play. Ten to 15 minutes before I got to know I would play. I learnt from my ODI mistake where I bowled with some flight. In the first innings it was a bit hard to score against their spinners...and I bowled according to my plans."
Aaron Finch On his injury:"Bit of a hip or glute, we'll wait and see, it progressively got worse throughout the game."
On Chahal: "They were let using know their doctor had ruled Jadeja out with concussion and you aren't challenging a medical expert in that regard. We probably leaked a few too many runs at the end and then in the middle phase struggled to heat boundaries."
Virat Kohli "Jaddu got a knock on the side of a head and was a bit dizzy and still is. Concussion replacements are a strange thing, today it worked for us maybe another time he wouldn't have found a like-for-like. He came in and bowled really well. The pitch offered him enough. We showed character to fight back...I thought they had a great start and they were cruising to be honest. That's how T20 goes, we put enough pressure on them, but you need a bit of luck."
I'll wrap things up for tonight. Excellent performance from India. From Gnasher and Varun it's goodbye and see you in a couple of days
