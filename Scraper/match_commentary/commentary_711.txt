"Harbhajan finally gets on the scorecard," chuckles Anand. Well, it didn't take long for India to finish this stand today, although it is a stand worth 31 which, on this pitch, could be valuable runs. Now it will be India's turn to show what they've got with the bat, which will give us a truer assessment of Australia's innings. 343 is a pretty handy total, I expect.
While we wait for India's dig, check out Anil Kumble's thoughts from yesterday and what Matthew Hayden had to say. Be quick about it, though, as the umpires are heading back out there.
92.4;W;Khan to Clark, OUT the bouncer, on an off-side line, Clark takes his eye off the ball and tries to make room for the hook, the ball sails up and over to long leg for a relatively straightforward catch by Harbhajan Singh;Stuart Clark c Harbhajan Singh b Khan 21 (30m 23b 3x4 0x6) SR: 91.3;
92.3;?;Khan to Clark, no run more of the short stuff, trying both to tempt him and scare him in equal measure, he ducks again;
92.2;?;Khan to Clark, no run short ball, trying to rough up the tailender here;
92.1;?;Khan to Clark, no run a touch short to begin with, a deliberate tactic;
91.6;?;Singh to Johnson, no run a swing and a miss, tries to work it to short midwicket again, but connects only with air;
91.5;?;Singh to Johnson, no run arcs the bat towards short midwicket for a dot;
91.5;1w;Singh to Johnson, 1 wide a rare off-side Test wide there, Johnson's feet trapped in the crease as he swishes a cut away from the body but just fails to connect, the swing carries it wider;
91.4;?;Singh to Johnson, no run outside off again, better length, Johnson content to leave it alone. Some encouraging swing away, but the ball kept pretty low on its way through;
91.3;4;Singh to Johnson, FOUR runs outside off, plenty of room and Johnson launches his shoulders into a very powerful back-foot cut through the vacant gully, and that will frustrate India who are keen to end this last stand;
91.2;?;Singh to Johnson, no run defended again;
91.1;?;Singh to Johnson, no run on the money first up, defended forward;
90.6;?;Khan to Clark, no run on middle, steps across to meet the pitch of the ball (like you should, of course) and drives out to mid off;

90.3;?;Khan to Johnson, no run a short and straight delivery, Johnson ducks the bouncer;
90.2;?;Khan to Johnson, no run a wildish one, pitching on leg and bending further, away, a grasping Dhoni fumbles and there's a bye there if they want one. They don't;

71.5;?;Kumble to Hogg, no run full and quite pacy, on the off stump, Hogg comes forward in tentative defence;
71.4;W;Kumble to Symonds, OUT Gone! That is a big wicket, huge bonus for India. Kumble drags this one just a touch short, Symonds sees the length and goes for the pull. The ball skids through and hurries on Symonds who is playing a short-arm pull. The batsman can't quite get the elevation he wants and Dinesh Karthik, the substitute fielder, takes a smart catch at midwicket. That is a big wicket for India. What a comeback this has been.;Andrew Symonds c sub (KD Karthik) b Kumble 35 (59m 42b 5x4 0x6) SR: 83.33;

70.2;2;Harbhajan to Symonds, 2 runs fullish and on the middle and leg, quite flat too, Symonds lap sweeps the ball very fine and it will be more runs even though the ball doesn't run away for four;

89.6;?;Singh to Clark, no run good-length ball outside the off, eased to cover;

88.2;?;Khan to Clark, no run short of a length and outside the off, punched awkwardly off the back foot back down the pitch;
88.1;1;Khan to Johnson, 1 run short one banged in, Johnson plays the pull, not totally in control, safely hit away for a single nevertheless;
69.6;?;Kumble to Symonds, no run right up there, a defence as watertight as you like, but someone still manages to say "Catch it". No chance;

86.1;W;Khan to Hogg, OUT Immediate reward for India! Zaheer sends this one in quick and outside the off, it's a bit of a loosener really. Brad Hogg goes for a fancy drive quite wide outside the off stump but only manages a thick edge. Rahul Dravid in the gully region makes no mistake and there's a wicket off the first ball with this second new ball for India.;Brad Hogg c Dravid b Khan 17 (54m 44b 0x4 0x6) SR: 38.63;
85.6;6;Kumble to Johnson, SIX runs Biggie! Johnson decides to change gears. He picks this length ball from Kumble and hits it with the angle, lofting the ball into the stands over long-on. That is a good, clean hit that goes all the way.;

A quick, flat ball on the stumps, it's a Kumble special and good batsmen have found this hard to keep out, forget about tailenders. Lee comes forward but is very late on the shot and wears the ball on pad in front of the stumps. The umpire thinks for a second and up goes the finger!;Brett Lee lbw b Kumble 0 (11m 12b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0;

75.3;W;Kumble to Gilchrist, OUT Golden arm! Another one for Anil Kumble who scalps yet another big wicket. Tossed up and outside the off. Gilchrist plants his foot down the pitch and plays the big slog sweep. The ball goes off the toe of the bat and straight up into the air. Sachin Tendulkar is in position at point and settles under a simple but critical catch.

67.5;1;Kumble to Symonds, 1 run eases a single into the short midwicket area this time;
67.4;4;Kumble to Symonds, FOUR runs outside off, Symonds really reaches out for that one and, despite being beaten in the flight, launches it right over long-on;

64.3;1;Khan to Gilchrist, 1 run short ball, Gilchrist swivels a pull behind square, watching the ball all the way;
64.2;?;Khan to Gilchrist, no run defended this time;

62.4;?;Khan to Gilchrist, no run looks to turn into the legs this time;

62.3;W;Khan to Hayden, OUT curled back in to him, cramped him for room and he popped a soft catch up towards mid on, stopping on the shot. A tame end to a forceful, aggressive-yet-patient innings;Matthew Hayden c Dravid b Khan 124 (268m 183b 9x4 0x6) SR: 67.75;

61.2;?;Singh to Symonds, no run another muscular clean cut, this one slightly later and so picking out gully;
61.1;4;Singh to Symonds, FOUR runs short, wide and Symonds slices through the ring, rocking back and cutting hard, harder and even harder;

60.5;?;Khan to Hayden, no run up there, a stab of a forward defence is the result;
60.4;?;Khan to Hayden, no run full delivery, almost a yorker, driven out to mid off where Harbhajan Singh collects the ball obligingly and even more amenably rubs it on one side before returning to Zaheer;
60.3;1;Khan to Symonds, 1 run this one is a quick drive into the covers;
60.2;?;Khan to Symonds, no run down leg again;
60.1;4;Khan to Symonds, FOUR runs down leg, a leg glance of a strangle is nearly caught by Dhoni, whose desperate dive to the left is just not enough;
59.6;1lb;Singh to Symonds, 1 leg bye down leg, swishes after it and helped it down to fine leg;
59.5;?;Singh to Symonds, no run content to leave this now, sniffing right over it, and letting a good-length delivery creep through outside off;

28.5;?;Khan to Hayden, no run once again Hayden is in gentle mood and leaves the ball alone to the keeper;
28.4;?;Khan to Hayden, no run A most pleasing sight for any bowler - Hayden leaves the ball alone. That's a good line and length, just short of a driving length and in that area outside the off, through to the keeper, good bounce and carry;
28.3;1;Khan to Jaques, 1 run Jaques is clever this time. He drops the ball down to the off side with soft hands and an angled bat and takes the single. Even the sprightly Yuvraj, who runs in from cover and fields, can't stop that single;
28.2;?;Khan to Jaques, no run pushed through a bit fuller and just outside the off, this time Jaques has not interest in playing a shot, decides early and leaves the ball alone to the keeper;

27.6;4;Harbhajan to Hayden, FOUR runs another one that's a bit straight, this time Hayden doesn't bother with hitting the sweep fine. Instead he bisects the two fielders in the deep and powers this one to the fence at fine-leg;
27.5;2;Harbhajan to Hayden, 2 runs Here we go. Full and on the pads, Hayden plays a muscular sweep quite fine and a couple of runs means it's a 28th Test half-century for Hayden;
27.4;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run short of a length and outside the off, Hayden comes across dramatically and leaves the ball alone;
27.3;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run tossed up a bit more and outside the off, Hayden gets his foot well down the pitch and drives powerfully to cover;
27.2;1;Harbhajan to Jaques, 1 run Jaques unveils the sweep, uncannily like how Justin Langer used to, efficiently hit away to the leg side;
27.1;?;Harbhajan to Jaques, no run well flighted and on the off stump, a bit of turn as Harbhajan bowls from over the stumps, played at and missed, through to the keeper;
26.6;?;Kumble to Hayden, no run on leg, thinks about turning it to midwicket but checks the shot at the last second;
26.5;?;Kumble to Hayden, no run up there on off, Kumble keeping him quiet;
26.4;?;Kumble to Hayden, no run a touch short, played off the back foot towards short midwicket and there's no chance of a single;
26.3;?;Kumble to Hayden, no run on leg, up off the pads and a shout, which is nothing more than hopeful, is turned down;
26.2;?;Kumble to Hayden, no run ramrod straight, defended down;

25.6;?;Harbhajan to Jaques, no run outside off, swept straight to the fielder;

24.4;?;Kumble to Jaques, no run defended on the front foot;
24.3;1;Kumble to Hayden, 1 run turned to short leg for an "Oiii" from Dhoni, the like of which have largely been missing this morning;
24.2;?;Kumble to Hayden, no run defended forward;
24.1;?;Kumble to Hayden, no run pushed to short cover;
23.6;?;Harbhajan to Jaques, no run left alone outside off;
23.5;4;Harbhajan to Jaques, FOUR runs outside leg, "Catch it" the vain cry as the ball races from the sweep between two fielders around square;

23.3;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run pushed across the left hander, some encouraging bounce;
23.2;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run defended on the front foot;
23.1;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run cover driven to... you guessed;
22.6;2;Singh to Jaques, 2 runs pulled again to bring up an excellent hundred partnership that has weathered the storm well before blossoming. The strike rate's pretty handy, too;
22.5;1;Singh to Hayden, 1 run pulled round to deep midwicket;

21.3;1;Harbhajan to Jaques, 1 run pitches on leg on a good length, turned across the left hander, biffed back to short midwicket;
21.2;?;Harbhajan to Jaques, no run padded up to that one that time;

20.6;?;Singh to Hayden, no run on middle and off, driven hard to mid on, but picks out the fielder;
20.5;3;Singh to Jaques, 3 runs driven aerially over the covers towards the rope where Harbhajan sweeps up;
20.4;?;Singh to Jaques, no run outside off, pushed off the back foot into the covers;
20.3;1;Singh to Hayden, 1 run hint of out swing to the left hander who pushes to mid on and collects a single easily enough;
20.2;?;Singh to Hayden, no run outside off, good length and so left alone, shouldering arms;
20.1;?;Singh to Hayden, no run outside off, well left alone;
19.6;3;Harbhajan to Hayden, 3 runs way outside off, Hayden reaches out for one of his back-foot cuts, this time he connects;

19.2;?;Harbhajan to Jaques, no run defended on the front foot;
19.1;4;Harbhajan to Jaques, FOUR runs howler of a misfield from Ganguly, who lets the ball nutmeg him after Jaques's sweep. No excuses and Harbhajan is, rightly, furious;
18.6;?;Ganguly to Hayden, no run left alone outside off;
18.6;2nb;Ganguly to Jaques, (no ball) 1 run on off, played off the front foot just in front of square;
18.5;2;Ganguly to Jaques, 2 runs waited for the ball to pretty much go past him on the rise before playing late off the back foot through the gully region;

18.3;?;Ganguly to Jaques, no run slants past the left hander just outside off, defended on the back foot;

17.2;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run goes after a wide one again;
17.1;?;Harbhajan to Hayden, no run a horrible, horrible... but comical shot... Hayden chasing a wide one and not letting it go, playing away from his body, and chopping down a bottom edge;

7.6;?;Singh to Jaques, no run crouches very late, sort-of ducking a sort-of bouncer;

7.4;1;Singh to Hayden, 1 run down leg, pushed to short midwicket where Jaffer does some excellent fielding - a jaffa of a piece of fielding if you like. Neither do I. We'll move on;

6.1;?;Khan to Jaques, no run big shout again, nipping back in off the seam, but probably just a tad high;

The second gully goes out on the drive
 Innings Start
India have been rolled over for only 196. After a strong bowling performance on the first day the batsmen have really let the team down. From the beginning of the innings not much went right, with only Tendulkar and Ganguly looking the part on a day when Australia's bowlers bowled with discipline.
The Australian reply is not far away. They lead by 147 ... Stay with us. While we're at a break have a look at the stats HRG is sending our way: "Lee-Gilchrist combination has accounted for 72 dismissal including three in this innings. Other bowler-wicket keeper combination to account for 70 dimissals are DK Lillee-RW Marsh {95}, GD McGrath-AC Gilchrist {90}, SM Pollock-MV Boucher {79} and MD Marshall-PJL Dujon {71}" What's more ... "Gilchrist with four catches in this innings equalled Ian Healy's record of 395 dismissals."
71.5;W;Lee to Khan, OUT And there's the end! fullish and outside the off stump, Zaheer goes for the big drive, the edge goes straight into Adam Gilchrist's gloves, no controversy there. That's now four wickets in an innings five innings on the trot for Brett Lee;Zaheer Khan c ?Gilchrist b Lee 11 (24m 14b 2x4 0x6) SR: 78.57;
71.4;1;Lee to Singh, 1 run short of a good length and on the off stump, driven out to the off side;

70.1;?;Hogg to Khan, no run tossed up and on the pads, played at and missed, rapped on the pad;
69.6;W;Lee to Kumble, OUT full and outside the off, just a hint of late swing, big drive played, the ball goes past the bat, sounds like there was an edge and the whole Austalian slips cordon goes up in appeal. Billy Bowden says no at first, then goes to the square-leg umpire to check if the catch was taken cleanly. That certainly carried cleanly to Gilchrist. Now Bowden gives it out and Kumble is not a happy man.;Anil Kumble c ?Gilchrist b Lee 27 (93m 76b 4x4 0x6) SR: 35.52;
69.5;?;Lee to Kumble, no run good length ball just outside the off, played at and missed, through to the keeper;
69.4;4;Lee to Kumble, FOUR runs low full-toss outside the off, Lee striving for the yorker and is once more unlucky as a thick outside edge goes just past the slip fielder and ruins away to the vacant third-man region;
69.4;1nb;Lee to Kumble, (no ball) short of a length once more, on the stumps, defended;
69.3;1;Lee to Khan, 1 run short one banged in, fended away awkwardly to the on side, Gilchrist gathers and throws the ball towards the stumps, Phil Jaques drops the ball and Kumble survives;
69.2;?;Lee to Khan, no run full and straight, pacy as well, defended back down the pitch to the bowler. Just a hint of reverse swing for Lee;
69.1;1lb;Lee to Kumble, 1 leg bye overpitched and on the pads, flick played and missed, off the pads down towards fine-leg;
68.6;4;Hogg to Khan, FOUR runs tossed up again and inviting the shot. Zaheer is happy to oblige and drives beautifully, if uppishly, through cover for the second boundary of the over;
68.5;?;Hogg to Khan, no run slightly shorter, slower through the air, a bit more turn, defended;
68.4;4;Hogg to Khan, FOUR runs contact this time, Zaheer picks this up from outside the off and swats it through cover;
68.3;?;Hogg to Khan, no run thrown higher up and outside the off, once again a big swing and a miss;
68.2;?;Hogg to Khan, no run tossed up and outside the off stump, played at and missed;

67.5;1nb;Lee to Kumble, (no ball) just short of a good length and outside the off, Kumble launches into a big drive but can't beat the fielder at cover;
67.5;2nb;Lee to Khan, (no ball) 1 run fullish and on the off, eased through cover;
67.4;1;Lee to Kumble, 1 run very full and outside the off, Zaheer can ease this through cover and pick up a single;
67.3;?;Lee to Kumble, no run fullish and outside the off stump, driven at and missed, through to the keeper;
67.2;?;Lee to Kumble, no run defended watchfully, again good pace;
67.1;?;Lee to Kumble, no run short of a good length and on the stumps, played back down to the bowler;
66.6;W;Hogg to Harbhajan, OUT tossed up and outside the off, Harbhajan is not picking Hogg here but goes for the big hit anyway. The ball goes straight up in the air and Michael Clarke has to use one hand to shield the sun before judging the catch well and taking it. Another Indian wicket gone and Hogg is growing in utility here;Harbhajan Singh c Clarke b Hogg 2 (29m 24b 0x4 0x6) SR: 8.33;
66.5;?;Hogg to Harbhajan, no run well flighted and outside the off, defended back down the pitch;

66.1;?;Hogg to Harbhajan, no run tossed up and outside the off, spinning in a touch, defended carefully;
65.6;?;Lee to Kumble, no run swinging yorker, spears in on the stumps late, Kumble does well to dig the ball out;
65.5;?;Lee to Kumble, no run fullish and outside the off stump, Kumble drives hard to the off side but can't beat cover;
65.4;?;Lee to Kumble, no run short and wide, but quick too, Kumble plays a cut and misses;
65.3;1;Lee to Harbhajan, 1 run fuller and on the stumps, flicked well through midwicket;
65.2;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run another short one, this one is going down leg side and Harbhajan gets out of the way;
65.1;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run Scorcher! Lee sends down a rocket. Short one that crashes into Harbhajan's rib-cage. He drops the bat instantly. That's a painful blow.;
64.6;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run shorter this time and just a bit of width, Kumble cuts but can't get the ball away;
64.5;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run slower through the air, the wrong 'un, bit of turn as well, carefully defended;
64.4;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run Hogg comes round the stumps, full and quite straight, defensive shot played and missed, rapped on the pad;
64.3;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run fullish and outside the off, driven back past the bowler to the off side;
64.2;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run full-toss this time, pushed to mid-off;
64.1;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run driven inside out to cover;
63.6;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run outside off, more width this time, and driven straight to the man at cover;
63.6;1nb;Lee to Harbhajan, (no ball) another threatening would-be yorker and now Lee's been no-balled. I don't even have to look at his face to know he is furious;
63.5;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run left alone outside off this time;
63.4;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run Lee, like John McEnroe, cannot believe it. Umpire Bowden's finger stayed down despite Lee's celebrations and there's nothing wrong with that delivery which was knocking middle stump out of the ground, low;
63.3;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run outside off, too quick for Harbhajan, who lunges late as the ball clatters past him and he has the good grace to smile afterwards, knowing he's been done;
63.2;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run well bowled down off this time;
63.1;4b;Lee to Harbhajan, 4 byes late swing down leg and Gilchrist's despairing dive to the left is also a fruitless one;
62.6;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run keeps very low, well bowled again, Kumble doing well to stab down defensively off the back foot at the last second;
62.5;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run comes right out to defend right over the ball this time;
62.4;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run on the legs this time, played forward;

62.1;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run outside off, left alone;
61.6;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run well bowled, right up there, and defended on the front foot;
61.5;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run squared up again but landed bat on it this time with a fensive push off the back foot;
61.4;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run did him again with a similar ball, but one which is slightly wider. He's got Harbhajan worried, though;
61.3;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run completely did him there, Harbhajan squared up a treat by one which pitches outside off and slightly moves away from him. Huge, but tellingly late, appeals from Lee and the fielders;
61.2;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run Harbhajan goes for a swish outside off, but the ball licks away from him late;
61.1;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run pushed towards the mid-off region;
60.6;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run and again. Cracking over;
60.5;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run defended on the front foot;
60.4;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run Ponting appeals from a short mid-off kind of placement, as the ball crashes in, but he's the only one asking;
60.3;1;Hogg to Harbhajan, 1 run well played, waiting for it, and driving through the covers, Symonds did well with an excellent save;
60.2;?;Hogg to Harbhajan, no run defended first up;
60.1;W;Hogg to Ganguly, OUT Got him. Hogg gets his first wicket, Ganguly undone by a wicked change of pace, the flipper skids through and knocks back the off stump as the batsman rocks back. A bamboozled Ganguly's on his way just short of his fifty;Sourav Ganguly b Hogg 43 (134m 79b 1x4 1x6) SR: 54.43;
59.6;?;Lee to Kumble, no run outside off, swinging away late, Kumble keen to wrist a late cut if possible, but pulls out of the shot owing to the movement;
59.5;?;Lee to Kumble, no run short and veering towards the hips, Kumble swats it back down, like brushing away an irritable fly;
59.4;?;Lee to Kumble, no run testing one, a sharp yorker, and Kumble did very well to defend;
59.3;?;Lee to Kumble, no run late on it, missed it as it went through to the keeper down the channel;
59.2;1;Lee to Ganguly, 1 run pushed forward for a quick single;
59.1;?;Lee to Ganguly, no run well bowled, just outside off;
58.6;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run pushed across the off side once more, driven out to the covers;
58.5;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run pushed across the right hander with a touch of room, played down well towards first slip;
58.4;1;Hogg to Ganguly, 1 run driven out through long off this time where Johnson tidies up;
58.3;?;Hogg to Ganguly, no run drift in there now, and defended forward;
58.2;2;Hogg to Ganguly, 2 runs well bowled on off, and moving but Ganguly adjusts to nudge away off through the slips;

47.4;W;Clark to Yuvraj, OUT fullish, outside the off stump, this one is a classic wobbler from Stuart Clark, Yuvraj has a dart at this one. There's a bit of a sound as the ball passes bat and a spontaneous appeal from the slips cordon, the wicketkeeper and the bowler are enough to convince Billy Bowden.

69.6;W;Lee to Kumble, OUT full and outside the off, just a hint of late swing, big drive played, the ball goes past the bat, sounds like there was an edge and the whole Austalian slips cordon goes up in appeal.

67.1;?;Lee to Kumble, no run short of a good length and on the stumps, played back down to the bowler;
66.6;W;Hogg to Harbhajan, OUT tossed up and outside the off, Harbhajan is not picking Hogg here but goes for the big hit anyway. The ball goes straight up in the air and Michael Clarke has to use one hand to shield the sun before judging the catch well and taking it. Another Indian wicket gone and Hogg is growing in utility here;Harbhajan Singh c Clarke b Hogg 2 (29m 24b 0x4 0x6) SR: 8.33;

65.2;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run another short one, this one is going down leg side and Harbhajan gets out of the way;
65.1;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run Scorcher! Lee sends down a rocket. Short one that crashes into Harbhajan's rib-cage. He drops the bat instantly. That's a painful blow.;

63.5;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run left alone outside off this time;
63.4;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run Lee, like John McEnroe, cannot believe it. Umpire Bowden's finger stayed down despite Lee's celebrations and there's nothing wrong with that delivery which was knocking middle stump out of the ground, low;
63.3;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run outside off, too quick for Harbhajan, who lunges late as the ball clatters past him and he has the good grace to smile afterwards, knowing he's been done;
63.2;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run well bowled down off this time;
63.1;4b;Lee to Harbhajan, 4 byes late swing down leg and Gilchrist's despairing dive to the left is also a fruitless one;
62.6;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run keeps very low, well bowled again, Kumble doing well to stab down defensively off the back foot at the last second;

61.1;?;Lee to Harbhajan, no run pushed towards the mid-off region;

60.4;?;Hogg to Kumble, no run Ponting appeals from a short mid-off kind of placement, as the ball crashes in, but he's the only one asking;

60.2;?;Hogg to Harbhajan, no run defended first up;
60.1;W;Hogg to Ganguly, OUT Got him. Hogg gets his first wicket, Ganguly undone by a wicked change of pace, the flipper skids through and knocks back the off stump as the batsman rocks back.

The Indians are back on the field. Australia's openers make their way out as well.
 Innings Start
Well then, Australia have authoratitively walked over India to blow them away in the first of four Tests. India lost their last five wickets for 27 as they melted in the Melbourne heat through Australia's fire. What a performance, they thoroughly deserve what is their 15th consecutive win. Hayden and Jaques set them up from the first morning, and the bowlers chipped in from there. India's selectors will now have to think about a batting reshuffle.
A disappointed Kumble tells Nine he thinks it was the first dig that lost it for them: "I think the first innings was very crucial. Getting out for less than 200 was disappointing."
Now it's Ponting. "Being this hot and the wicket as flat as it was we had to call on bowlers to be patient. Right through this game they've been fantastic."
He's not thinking of matching the record run of 16 Tests, and neither is the team. "If you start thinking about those things, you're not paying attention to the things you need to."
And now it's time for the Man of the Match, who is of course Matthew Hayden. He wins $3000 and a crystal trophy. "I must admit I really do enjoy playing India. We've been looking forward to this competition for quite a while now."
That's all for now from this Test, so thanks for joining me, Jenny Thompson, and him, Anand Vasu, throughout the four days. Come back again for the next Test, though, won't you which begins in Sydney ... next year, on January 2. We look forward to seeing you then.
PS A retrospective note. Ganguly's second-innings dismissal was changed after the match to caught off a thin edge to the man short in on the off.
