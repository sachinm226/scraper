Data
Isaac Marshall: "AUS have a really good chance at the 2020 WC at home with a potential T20 team of Warner, Finch, Smith, Lynn, Handscomb, Maxwell, Stoinis, Cummins, Starc, Fawad and Behrendorff with Short, Turner, Zampa and Tye on the bench maybe"
Ravindra Shenoy: "It's better that Dhoni retires respectfully rather than shamefully, he has been hogging strike and creating undue pressure on the batsman on the other side. Even in Australia his strike rate was below 80. He will be India's liability for the World Cup. I don't understand how Umesh Yadav gets a nod despite being the only bowler who is wayward and leak runs. "
8.35pm Rahul's fifty on return to the side apart, not much for India to cheer about. Even on a pitch painfully slow where shot-making got harder and harder, India have fallen well short of a competitive total, managing only 61 in the last 12 overs. Australia stuck to their task, with the quicks banging the ball on a length as it was sticking in the surface. Zampa did his job with the wicket of Kohli that shifted momentum, which India were never able to regain. Dhoni was left stranded with a long-tail, having to refuse singles but also struggling to find the boundary himself. Back with the chase soon

Davis: "If India take a couple of cues from other balanced teams, India would ideally play the following 11 as a full strength team in England, to cover all the bases and have a variety. Dhawan, Sharma, Kohli, Dhoni, Pant/Karthik/Rayudu,Jadhav,Shankar,Pandya,Kumar,Chahal/Yadav, Bumrah. This would offer a lengthy batting lineup, strong middle order firepower and enough variety for bowling. Standby players: Jadeja & Shami, as Pant can be a spare opener and Raydu/Karthik fighting for the middle slots"
Venki: "@JJ, Kohli has already indicated his intentions to give game time to WC probables rather than focus on the result. What India are doing is thinking beyond the scope of just this one match, which is not naive at all."
Kannan: "@Shankar Sarkar Underdogs??? Australia???? They are fresh from BBL. That too a T20 match, I don't see them as underdog"
Bones the haddi: "@Bills - Virat was more referring to KL Rahul. "

Bills : "Virat said that players likely to be in the World Cup squad will get a play time? So is Umesh Yadav seriously in the contention for a place in the team? His recent performances don't keep him. "
JJ: "India is getting really naive, there is not a single player who can bowl beyond the 5 bowlers. (Kohli's 70 mph dibbly dobblers dont count, I mean someone who could genuinely bowl 2 overs) I'm thinking that even if you never use them there should be a least one alternative for the batsman to have to think about. But worse than that what happens if one of the others get injured in their first over? They are willing to lose a game on a quite possible scenario like that... naive"
Shankar Sarkar: "After Sri Lanka's epic victory, I kind of root for the underdogs! T20 series 1-1, ODI series 3-2 to Australia!"
Aaron Finch, of course, is fresh from leading the Melbourne Renegades to their maiden Big Bash title. Here's more on that, from our Talking T20 crew's in-depth chat with title-winning coach Andrew McDonald.
Australia XI: Finch (capt), Short, Stoinis, Maxwell, Handscomb (wk), Turner, Coulter-Nile, Cummins, Jhye Richardson, Behrendorff, Zampa
India XI: Rohit, Rahul, Kohli, Pant, Dhoni, Karthik, Krunal, Umesh, Chahal, Markande, Bumrah
Kohli: People who might possibly make the World Cup squad will get some game time. KL Rahul comes back, Shikhar Dhawan has been rested. Vijay Shankar misses out.
Australia have won the toss and opted to bowl. Handscomb to not only debut but also keep wickets.
6.30pm So familiar with each other by now, Kohli and Finch may as well be completing each others sentences. They are all set for the toss.
J. Wadekar: "@Abhijato - aren't you the Crystal Ball bloke? He's set the stage alight with accurate predictions all over Cricinfo Town! He's predicted Sri Lanka's unlikely victory, the BBL collapse, and the entire script of a PSL match in the past week!"
vipul khemka: "If Vijay Shankar plays, India should give him few overs as well... so that he can learn how to cover few overs for any main bowler having a bad day..."
Sooryanarayanan: "At this rate I will have hardly any uncapped Mumbai Indians player for the IPL Fantasy League :p first Krunal and now Markande. But jokes apart, he deserves it. Go well Mayank. "
Abhijato: "I love the fact that unlike the other top T20I teams, India seems to stay very consistent (no.2 in rankings) despite trialling new players all the time in this format. South Africa does it too, but they don't get the same magnitude of results. This is surely a result of two factors - immense talent because of IPL, and the confidence the golden men Kohli and Rohit inject into the side despite its composition. Will be exciting to see Markande join the list of elite spinners in the Indian line-up!"
Kohli's return might mean that Vijay Shankar has to drop down the order, but as the allrounder of refreshing candour reveals in this interview, he has learnt from the sleepless nights before and after the Nidhas Trophy final, and a year later, feels confident of tackling any situation. And will KL Rahul be able to make a backdoor entry into World Cup reckoning after regaining form against England Lions?
My colleague, Varun Shetty, who is at the venue, informs that Peter Handscomb is set to make his T20I debut. India are set have their own debutant, in legspinner Mayank Markande. Varun also adds that Dhoni is the only one wearing wicketkeeping gloves, which suggests that he is certain to play, but both Kohli and Rishabh Pant were practicing clearing the straight boundary from the same spot, so Pant might come in as batsman again.
6.00pm Hello and welcome to our coverage of the 4th T20I between India and Australia. Scratch that, it's the 1st T20I of a brand new series of two. Undoubtedly, there are many things factored in before scheduling a series, but often, logic isn't one of them. With the World Cup top priority and the IPL sandwiched between, wouldn't more ODIs have served the purpose better? Virat Kohli, back at the helm after missing the last five matches in New Zealand, certainly believes so.

Also back after a rest is Jasprit Bumrah, so what's lacking in context, should be more than made up for in skill and entertainment, writes Andrew McGlashan In his preview. If your idea of entertainment is sixes, Rohit Sharma is just two away from becoming the most prolific six-hitter in T20Is
 Innings Start
That's all from us, hoping everyone has their fingernails in tact, goodnight.
Nathan Coulter-Nile is the man of the match for his three for 26: We had worked out pretty quickly that it wasn't coming on, so dragged our lengths back. Don't remember the last time we had a win when I was playing, so it's always good to win a game, hopefully we can go on and win the series
Finch: When Bumrah has got overs up his sleeve it's never easy, but the run-outs didn't help either. Maxwell played a hell of an innings on a difficult pitch.
Kohli Very pleased with the bowling effort, never thought we'd be in this situation but Bumrah can do wonders, even Mayank bowled brilliantly, I thought. We want to give Rahul and Rishabh game-time. Rahul played a really good knock, we had a good partnership, had we gone on though, we could have got 150, which would have been a match-winning score on this pitch. But Australia played better cricket overall and deserved to win
Bhupathi: "Low scoring games are always fun to watch. Teams around the world are unable to decode how to phase the innings while chase low scores. "
Bhavik: "All efforts from Bumrah wasted by Yadav. Bhuvi would have done the job for India. Really should have a win after Bumrah's effort"
Maxwell: I was able to control the middle overs. Our wickets caused a bit of chaos towards the end but credit to Richardson and Cummins for finishing it off
Wow, what a cracker we've witnessed at Vizag, which saw a tie the last time India were here. Again, it's a last ball finish which went down to the throw hurled at the bowler's end, beaten by a scampering Jhye Richardson. Australia were coasting with Maxwell and Short, batted like blind men groping in the dark post their dismissals, a brilliant 19th over from Bumrah turned the tide in India's favour, but Cummins found the boundary when they most needed it and they ran like their lives depended on it to steal two off the last ball, and go one-nil up.
