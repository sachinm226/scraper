31.6;?;Bilal Asif to Finch, no run stabs forward but is hit on the pad, there's an appeal but the umpire turns it down seemingly because the impact was outside the line of off stump.

29.6;4;Wahab Riaz to Khawaja, FOUR runs just an extension of his forward defence and has he laced this through mid-off or what. Delightful cover drive. Didn't try to hit it hard, all timing and grace. Khawaja can be a delight to watch when he's set and there's certainty in his strokeplay.;

26.6;?;Yasir Shah to Finch, no run shorter length, less venomous, he's back and defending into the off side;
26.5;?;Yasir Shah to Finch, no run lovely leg break, beats him! Slightly slower and higher, he's drawn to defend and it bites past the edge. Great delivery;
26.4;?;Yasir Shah to Finch, no run tossed high, drifting into middle, he drives firmly back to the bowler;
26.3;?;Yasir Shah to Finch, no run leg break outside off, 86kph, he watches it pass to the keeper;
