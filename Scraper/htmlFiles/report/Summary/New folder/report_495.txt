The contest provided little more than a run around for the Australians as they swept past an outfit including their squad mates Daniel Christian, Tim Paine and Nathan Hauritz. Warner, who scored 72 in the loss to Zimbabwe on Tuesday, backed up with 51 off 41 balls and David Hussey raced to 49 to set up Australia's 189 for 8. Clarke (30), Cameron White (24) and Shane Watson (17) also contributed as the side tried to find a successful method to prevent a repeat of last year's first-round exit. Hussey's display included three sixes off Hauritz late in the innings as the bowler gave up 34 runs in three overs. Steven Smith, Michael Clarke and Hussey were all employed as slow bowlers by Australia in a possible indication of the make-up of the side for the opening match, although the tourists might have wanted Hauritz to operate against the best batsmen on offer. Shaun Tait was a late arrival due to his Indian Premier League adventures and showed some decent form in collecting 2 for 19 in four overs as the home side was dismissed for 88. Christian, who removed David Hussey when he bowled, was the equal top scorer for the Windward Islands with 20 along with Lyndon James. Smith, the legspinner, and Clarke collected two wickets each to conclude the low-key affair. The step up in competition arrives when they play Pakistan in St Lucia, a contest which is followed by Wednesday's fixture with Bangladesh in Barbados.
