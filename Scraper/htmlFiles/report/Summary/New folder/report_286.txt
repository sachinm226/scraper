Steady rain had threatened successive washouts in the series but relented to allow a sizeable crowd some action. Australia needed 15 going into the final over and Wayne Parnell conceded only a run each off the first two deliveries, but Hodge was to seal it with two balls to spare, the couple of sixes followed by one called wide for height. David Warner was South Africa's tormentor again at the start of the chase, as he and Aaron Finch took 21 off Lonwabo Tsotsobe's first over. Warner then hit debutant Beuran Hendricks for three successive boundaries in the third over as Australia surged to 44 for 1 in three overs. South Africa hit back with four strikes in the next three, including Warner, caught in front for 40 off 16 missing a switch-hit against JP Duminy, whose only over went for five and produced two wickets. Momentum had changed sides numerous times in the game, and South Africa seemed to have achieved the final swing in their favour, but Hodge wasn't done yet. South Africa had plodded to 11 for 1 in three overs after being asked to bat, but Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis took 69 off the final four, swinging and connecting six sixes between them, including successive ones off Dan Christian and Mitchell Starc.
