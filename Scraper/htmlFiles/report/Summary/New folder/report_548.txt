The tourists were dismissed for 131 in 40.2 overs after starting the match by dropping to 5 for 19. South Africa passed the target for the loss of three wickets and levelled the five-fixture contest that will determine the game's No. 1 side. "That was as bad as we've played in a long time," Ponting told AAP. AdChoices ADVERTISEMENT Ponting blamed poor shots for the tiny total, which was inflated by Callum Ferguson's 50 off 83 deliveries, his second ODI half-century. "We knew that the ball would probably swing a little bit this morning," Ponting said. "It wasn't as if it was swinging around corners either. The wicket was very good. There were some poor shots today from the top-order players in particular and we exposed our middle order to the new ball." Despite the significant defeat, which followed their 141-run win on Friday, Ponting said it was time to move on. "We've had one poor performance," he said. "We've got a few days to try to turn things around. I'm sure that you'll see a better team on Thursday." Ricky Ponting Australia South Africa South Africa vs Australia Australia tour of South Africa
