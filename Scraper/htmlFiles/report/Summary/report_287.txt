Persistent rain in Port Elizabeth meant that no play was possible in the first T20, and the teams will now head to Durban for Wednesday's second match, followed by the third game in Centurion. The rain was mostly unrelenting in Port Elizabeth and although there were brief periods when the covers appeared set to come off, there was always another shower on the way. With the World T20 in Bangladesh to follow straight after this series, these matches are the only chance for both sides to find their best T20 form and settle on their preferred line-ups.
