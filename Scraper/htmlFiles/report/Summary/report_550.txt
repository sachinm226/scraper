Brad Haddin, the stand-in captain, felt his side was already on the plane home following the tough one-day series, and they were dismissed for 108 before going down by seven wickets. However, Haddin was pleased with the effort of Lee, who had figures of 1 for 22 from four overs in a promising start following five months out with foot and ankle problems. "It was good to see the return of Brett Lee and if tonight's any indication of how he's going to go it looks like he is going to come back with some pretty good pace," Haddin told AAP after the match. AdChoices ADVERTISEMENT Lee's first ball was recorded at 149kph and gained an edge from Salman Butt, but it went for four when Marcus North couldn't hold the catch in the cordon. "I think it shocked the slips a bit, just how quick it did come through," Haddin said. "It was good to see." Lee's wicket came when Ahmed Shehzad miscued a pull and was caught by a diving Ben Laughlin. While Lee came through the match and will now head to South Africa for the IPL, Shane Watson will fly home after injuring his groin. Watson, who struck 33 from 14 deliveries, and Haddin (24) put on 42 for the opening wicket before Pakistan took control with Watson's exit to Umar Gul. "From that moment on we were totally outplayed for the remainder of the match," Haddin said. "It looked like we didn't bring our game at all and we had half a foot on the plane." Shahid Afridi stepped in with three wickets and Gul picked up 4 for 8 from four overs to set up Pakistan's victory. Kamran Akmal's unbeaten half-century guided them home in the 17th over.
