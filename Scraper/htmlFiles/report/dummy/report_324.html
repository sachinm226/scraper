  Eight Australian bowlers had a workout on the second day of their warm-up match in Chennai and Moises Henriques and Nathan Lyon were the most successful. They worked their way through the Board President's XI top order and helped the Australians secure a slender first-innings lead.

  Ambati Rayudu scored 87 for the Board President's XI but didn't get much support from anyone else. Parvez Rassol, who had taken seven wickets on the first day, made 36 at No. 8, the next best score. The home side was dismissed for 230.

  "I have worked a lot on my game with Robin Singh and Mr Sharath and I am getting into good positions, having enough time to play my shots," Rayudu said after the game. "Mentally I am looking to spend a lot more time in the middle. Have been relaxed the whole season, happy that I am getting into a zone such as this.

  "Most of them were the same pace, they were really trying to swing the old ball, use a lot of reverse," he said of the Australian bowlers. "They got reverse swing after about 30 overs, it started reversing pretty early and they worked on it as well. They are looking to pull out a lot of reverse swing."
